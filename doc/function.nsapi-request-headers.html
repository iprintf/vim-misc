nsapi_request_headers

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.3, PHP 5, PHP 7)

nsapi_request_headers — Fetch all HTTP request headers

说明

array nsapi_request_headers ( void )

nsapi_request_headers() gets all the HTTP headers in the current request. This
is only supported when PHP runs as a NSAPI module.

    Note:

    Prior to PHP 4.3.3, getallheaders() was only available for the Apache
    servers. After PHP 4.3.3, getallheaders() is an alias for 
    nsapi_request_headers() if you use the NSAPI module.

    Note:

    You can also get at the value of the common CGI variables by reading them
    from the $_SERVER superglobal, which works whether or not you are using PHP
    as a NSAPI module.

返回值

Returns an associative array with all the HTTP headers.

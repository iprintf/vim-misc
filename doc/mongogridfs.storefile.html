MongoGridFS::storeFile — Stores a file in the database

说明

public mixed MongoGridFS::storeFile ( string|resource $filename [, array
$metadata = array() [, array $options = array() ]] )

参数

filename

    Name of the file or a readable stream to store.

metadata

    Other metadata fields to include in the file document.

        Note:

        These fields may also overwrite those that would be created
        automatically by the driver, as described in the MongoDB core
        documentation for the » files collection. Some practical use cases for
        this behavior would be to specify a custom chunkSize or _id for the
        file.

options

    An array of options for the insert operations executed against the chunks
    and files collections. See MongoCollection::insert() for documentation on
    these these options.

返回值

Returns the _id of the saved file document. This will be a generated MongoId
unless an _id was explicitly specified in the extra parameter.

错误／异常

Throws MongoGridFSException if there is an error reading filename or inserting
into the chunks or files collections.

范例

Example #1 MongoGridFS::storeFile() with additional metadata

<?php
$m = new MongoClient();
$gridfs = $m->selectDB('test')->getGridFS();

$id = $gridfs->storeFile('example.txt', array('contentType' => 'plain/text'));
$gridfsFile = $gridfs->get($id);

var_dump($gridfsFile->file);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

array(7) {
  ["_id"]=>
  object(MongoId)#6 (0) {
  }
  ["contentType"]=>
  string(10) "plain/text"
  ["filename"]=>
  string(11) "example.txt"
  ["uploadDate"]=>
  object(MongoDate)#7 (0) {
  }
  ["length"]=>
  int(26)
  ["chunkSize"]=>
  int(262144)
  ["md5"]=>
  string(32) "c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b"
}

===============================================================================

Pass

$options['safe'] = true;

to make Mongo slow down and do inserts sequentially instead of in parallel.

Use case:

I had 274 PDF documents stored on ext3 disk (avg. size was 5MB, none over 20MB)

A PHP loop loaded each PDF, then did a $GridFS->storeFile( $data, $meta );

This caused server to spike from load average of 0.2 to over 20.0

Apparently what was happening is the loop slammed Mongo (then memory, disk)
with 274 convert/stores to do all at once.

Adding

$GridFS->storeFile( $data, $meta, array( 'safe' => true ) );

made the loop slow down and wait for each insert to finish and be confirmed
before going on to next PDF.

Moral: Safe option can be used to maintain sanity and is not always just for
data validity.

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

swftext::setspacing() sets the current font spacing to spacing. Default is 1.0.
0 is all of the letters written at the same point. This doesn't really work
that well because it inflates the advance across the letter, doesn't add the
same amount of spacing between the letters. I should try and explain that
better, prolly. Or just fix the damn thing to do constant spacing. This was
really just a way to figure out how letter advances work, anyway.. So nyah.

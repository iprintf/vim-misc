ssh2_auth_pubkey_file — Authenticate using a public key

说明

bool ssh2_auth_pubkey_file ( resource $session , string $username , string
$pubkeyfile , string $privkeyfile [, string $passphrase ] )

Authenticate using a public key read from a file.

参数

session

    An SSH connection link identifier, obtained from a call to ssh2_connect().

username

pubkeyfile

    The public key file needs to be in OpenSSH's format. It should look
    something like:

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA....NX6sqSnHA8= rsa-key-20121110

privkeyfile

passphrase

    If privkeyfile is encrypted (which it should be), the passphrase must be
    provided.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Authentication using a public key

<?php
$connection = ssh2_connect('shell.example.com', 22, array('hostkey'=>'ssh-rsa'
));

if (ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($connection, 'username',
                          '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub',
                          '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa', 'secret')) {
  echo "Public Key Authentication Successful\n";
} else {
  die('Public Key Authentication Failed');
}
?>

注释

    Note:

    The underlying libssh library doesn't support partial auths very cleanly
    That is, if you need to supply both a public key and a password it will
    appear as if this function has failed. In this particular case a failure
    from this call may just mean that auth hasn't been completed yet. You would
    need to ignore this failure and continue on and call ssh2_auth_password()
    in order to complete authentication.

===============================================================================

This function has a known bug (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=58573) under
some Linux installations: you can't encrypt your private key if you've compiled
libssh2 using libgcrypt.  According to the bug page, the solution is to rebuild
libssh2 with OpenSSL.  (Or don't encrypt your private key, but that seems
irresponsible somehow.)

This isn't a bug report -- the bug is apparently already being fixed -- but a
note for others, because it took me at least an hour of Googling to realize the
problem wasn't with my own code.
===============================================================================

Beware of the tilde (~) in the key file paths, as they will trigger the
following warning (on a debug build):

PHP Warning:  String is not zero-terminated (ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ1wjj*=?<)
(source: Zend/zend_execute.h:81) in Unknown on line 0

although the authentication will suceed.

<?php
    $ssh_conn = ssh2_connect('test.host.com', 22, array('hostkey' => 'ssh-rsa'
));
    ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($ssh_conn, 'user', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub', '~/.ssh/
id_rsa')
?>

The above code will throw the Warning.

<?php
    $ssh_conn = ssh2_connect('test.host.com', 22, array('hostkey' => 'ssh-rsa'
));
    ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($ssh_conn, 'user', '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub', '/
home/user/.ssh/id_rsa')
?>

The above code won't.

If you want to perform a dynamic replacement of the tilde, you can use
posix_getpwuid (http://php.net/manual/en/function.posix-getpwuid.php)

On my linux debian server running php communicating with another linux debian
server I had problems getting rsa to work. dsa worked out of the box. I got it
to work by doing the following in terminal

* ssh-keygen -t rsa
.... PUBFILE
* ssh-keygen -f PUBFILE -e
OUTPUT

id_rsa.pub =
ssh-rsa OUTPUT [COMMENT]
===============================================================================

Well, you have to format the publickey with the following command:

# ssh-keygen -f id_rsa.pub -i
Output: "ssh-rsa <YOURKEYDATA>"

That worked fine for me.
===============================================================================

rsa keys may don't work, using dsa keys are more compatible

Linux:
ssh-keygen -t dsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
chmod -R 600 ~/.ssh/*

PHP:
<?php
    $methods = array(
    'kex' => 'diffie-hellman-group1-sha1',
    'hostkey' => 'ssh-dss',
    'client_to_server' => array(
    'crypt' => '3des-cbc',
    'mac' => 'hmac-md5',
    'comp' => 'none'),
    'server_to_client' => array(
    'crypt' => '3des-cbc',
    'mac' => 'hmac-md5',
    'comp' => 'none'));
    $connect = ssh2_connect('127.0.0.1', 22, $methods);
    if(ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($connect, 'username', '~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub', '~/.ssh
/id_dsa'))
    {
        echo "Public Key Authentication Successful\n";
    }
    else
    {
        echo "Public Key Authentication Failed\n";
    }
?>
===============================================================================

I had an anoyiing problem with this function, everytime I tried to make it run
it responds with an

Authentication failed for <user> using public key

but when I try directly to connect to the server using
ssh <user>@<domain>
Things works fine...

After lots of intents I realize that local files were read protected from user
apache (they were stored at /home/<user>/.ssh directory)

So, if you also have this problem, just make a new directory into a place where
apache can read and place there the keys.

The whole thing I do is as follows (Linux & Apache both server and client):

First I create a directory where apache can read

mkdir ~/.newssh_keys
chmod 777 ~/.newssh_keys

(This is a security issue, so maybe you need to realize how to make it safer.)

Then I create keys into local server choosing ~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa as the file
to save the key:

ssh-keygen -t dsa
...
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/<user>/.ssh/id_dsa): ~/.newssh_keys/
id_dsa
...

Then I have to change permissions to private key
(This is a security issue, so maybe you need to realize how to make it safer.)

chmod 644 ~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa

I copy the public key into the server's .ssh directory
client$ scp id_dsa.pub <remoteuser>@<server_domain>:~/.ssh/

and then I connect myself to the server using traditional ssh in order to
append the public key at the end of authorized_keys2 file

server$ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2

and remove the public key in order to be clean
server$ rm ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub

Finally I use this code into my php script

<?php
// This in order to be sure apache can read public key
// (remove this after debug)
$pub_key = file_get_contents('~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa.pub');
print "<pre>";
var_export($pub_key);
print "</pre>";

// This in order to check private one
// (remove this after debug)
$prv_key = file_get_contents('~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa');
print "<pre>";
var_export($prv_key);
print "</pre>";

// Finally the connection code
$connection = ssh2_connect('<server_domain>', 22, array('hostkey', 'ssh-dss'));
if (ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($connection, '<server_user>',
                          '~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa.pub',
                          '~/.newssh_keys/id_dsa')) {
  echo "Public Key Authentication Successful\n";
} else {
  echo "Public Key Authentication Failed";
}
?>

Setting up public key authentication:

1.  Login to the unix server you want to connect using putty.
2.  mkdir .ssh (there is a dot before ssh)
3.  cd .ssh
4.  ssh-keygen -t rsa mykey
5.  Enter passphrase as test
6.  ls -al -> you will find two files mykey , mykey.pub
7.  cat mykey.pub >>authorized_keys
8.  cat mykey
9.  Copy what you get on screen to notepad and save it as "c:\mykey" (within
quotes)
10.  cat mykey.pub
11.  Copy what you get on screen to notepad and save it as "c:\mykey.pub"
(within quotes)

This is probably incredibly insecure but if you are in a closed environment,
you can run it at your own risk.

I was trying to get ssh access from server A to server B but server A was
running apache as 'apache' and
I needed files on server B that were owned by root. So I needed some way for
the apache user to connect
to server B as root.  Here's what I did (both servers running linux -
specifically CentOS4):

1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa  generate with no passphrase
2. append the id_rsa.pub file to server B /root/.ssh/authorized_keys2
3. copy the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files to a directory like /var/www/.ssh/
(happens to be apache's home dir on CentOS)
4. chown -R apache.apache /var/www/.ssh

Then you can connect like this:
$connection = ssh2_connect($server,22,array('hostkey'=>'ssh-rsa'));
if (ssh2_auth_pubkey_file($connection,'root',
'/var/www/.ssh/id_rsa.pub',
'/var/www/.ssh/id_rsa')) {
echo "success!";
}
else
{
echo "no success :-(";
}

(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

MongoCollection::batchInsert — Inserts multiple documents into this collection

说明

public mixed MongoCollection::batchInsert ( array $a [, array $options = array
() ] )

参数

a

    An array of arrays or objects. If any objects are used, they may not have
    protected or private properties.

        Note:

        If the documents to insert do not have an _id key or property, a new
        MongoId instance will be created and assigned to it. See 
        MongoCollection::insert() for additional information on this behavior.

options

    An array of options for the batch of insert operations. Currently available
    options include:
      □ "continueOnError"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. If set, the database will not stop
        processing a bulk insert if one fails (eg due to duplicate IDs). This
        makes bulk insert behave similarly to a series of single inserts,
        except that calling MongoDB::lastError() will have an error set if any
        insert fails, not just the last one. If multiple errors occur, only the
        most recent will be reported by MongoDB::lastError().

            Note:

            Please note that continueOnError affects errors on the database
            side only. If you try to insert a document that has errors (for
            example it contains a key with an empty name), then the document is
            not even transferred to the database as the driver detects this
            error and bails out. continueOnError has no effect on errors
            detected in the documents by the driver.

      □ "fsync"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Forces the insert to be synced to disk
        before returning success. If TRUE, an acknowledged insert is implied
        and will override setting w to 0.

      □ "j"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Forces the write operation to block until
        it is synced to the journal on disk. If TRUE, an acknowledged write is
        implied and this option will override setting "w" to 0.

            Note: If this option is used and journaling is disabled, MongoDB
            2.6+ will raise an error and the write will fail; older server
            versions will simply ignore the option.

      □ "socketTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for socket
        communication. If the server does not respond within the timeout
        period, a MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown and there will be
        no way to determine if the server actually handled the write or not. A
        value of -1 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 30000 (30 seconds).

      □ "w"

        See WriteConcerns. The default value for MongoClient is 1.

      □ "wTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for write
        concern acknowledgement. It is only applicable when "w" is greater than
        1, as the timeout pertains to replication. If the write concern is not
        satisfied within the time limit, a MongoCursorException will be thrown.
        A value of 0 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 10000 (ten seconds).

    The following options are deprecated and should no longer be used:
      □ "safe"

        Deprecated. Please use the WriteConcern w option.

      □ "timeout"

        Integer, defaults to MongoCursor::$timeout. If "safe" is set, this sets
        how long (in milliseconds) for the client to wait for a database
        response. If the database does not respond within the timeout period, a
        MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown.

      □ "wtimeout"

        Deprecated alias for "wTimeoutMS".

返回值

If the w parameter is set to acknowledge the write, returns an associative
array with the status of the inserts ("ok") and any error that may have
occurred ("err"). Otherwise, returns TRUE if the batch insert was successfully
sent, FALSE otherwise.

错误／异常

Throws MongoException if any inserted documents are empty or if they contains
zero-length keys. Attempting to insert an object with protected and private
properties will cause a zero-length key error.

Throws MongoCursorException if the "w" option is set and the write fails.

Throws MongoCursorTimeoutException if the "w" option is set to a value greater
than one and the operation takes longer than MongoCursor::$timeout milliseconds
to complete. This does not kill the operation on the server, it is a
client-side timeout. The operation in MongoCollection::$wtimeout is
milliseconds.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      Added the "wTimeoutMS" option, which replaces "wtimeout". Emits
      E_DEPRECATED when "wtimeout" is used.

1.5.0 Added the "socketTimeoutMS" option, which replaces "timeout". Emits
      E_DEPRECATED when "timeout" is used.

      Emits E_DEPRECATED when "safe" is used.

1.3.4 Added "wtimeout" option.
1.3.0 Added "w" option.
1.2.7 Added "continueOnError" option.
      Added ability to pass integers to the "safe" option, which previously
      only accepted booleans.
1.0.9
      Added "fsync" option.

1.0.5 Added options parameter.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::batchInsert() example

Batch insertion is a quick way to add many elements to the database at once

<?php

$users = array();
for ($i = 0; $i<100; $i++) {
  $users[] = array('username' => 'user'.$i, 'i' => $i);
}

$mongo = new MongoClient();
$collection = $mongo->my_db->users;
$collection->drop();

$collection->batchInsert($users);

foreach ($users as $user) {
  echo $user['_id']."\n"; // populated with instanceof MongoId
}

$users = $collection->find()->sort(array('i' => 1));
foreach ($users as $user) {
    var_dump($user['username']);
}

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

4bf43ac68ead0e1971000000
4bf43ac68ead0e1971010000
4bf43ac68ead0e1971020000
...
string(5) "user1"
string(5) "user2"
string(5) "user3"
...

Example #2 MongoCollection::batchInsert() example with ignoring errors

<?php

$con = new Mongo;
$db = $con->demo;

$doc1 = array(
        '_id' => new MongoId('4cb4ab6d7addf98506010001'),
        'id' => 1,
        'desc' => "ONE",
);
$doc2 = array(
        '_id' => new MongoId('4cb4ab6d7addf98506010002'),
        'id' => 2,
        'desc' => "TWO",
);
$doc3 = array(
        '_id' => new MongoId('4cb4ab6d7addf98506010002'), // same _id as above
        'id' => 3,
        'desc' => "THREE",
);
$doc4 = array(
        '_id' => new MongoId('4cb4ab6d7addf98506010004'),
        'id' => 4,
        'desc' => "FOUR",
);

$c = $db->selectCollection('c');
$c->batchInsert(
    array($doc1, $doc2, $doc3, $doc4),
    array('continueOnError' => true)
);

$docs = $c->find();
foreach ($docs as $doc) {
    var_dump($doc['desc']);
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

string(3) "ONE"
string(3) "TWO"
string(4) "FOUR"

EvLoop::now — Returns the current "event loop time"

说明

public double EvLoop::now ( void )

Returns the current "event loop time", which is the time the event loop
received events and started processing them. This timestamp does not change as
long as callbacks are being processed, and this is also the base time used for
relative timers. You can treat it as the timestamp of the event occurring(or
more correctly, libev finding out about it).

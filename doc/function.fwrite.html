fwrite

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fwrite — 写入文件（可安全用于二进制文件）

说明

int fwrite ( resource $handle , string $string [, int $length ] )

fwrite() 把 string 的内容写入文件指针 handle 处。

参数

handle

    文件系统指针，是典型地由 fopen() 创建的 resource(资源)。

string

    The string that is to be written.

length

    如果指定了 length，当写入了 length 个字节或者写完了 string 以后，写入就会停
    止，视乎先碰到哪种情况。

    注意如果给出了 length 参数，则 magic_quotes_runtime 配置选项将被忽略，而
    string 中的斜线将不会被抽去。

返回值

fwrite() 返回写入的字符数，出现错误时则返回 FALSE 。

注释

    Note:

    Writing to a network stream may end before the whole string is written.
    Return value of fwrite() may be checked:
    <?php
    function fwrite_stream($fp, $string) {
        for ($written = 0; $written < strlen($string); $written += $fwrite) {
            $fwrite = fwrite($fp, substr($string, $written));
            if ($fwrite === false) {
                return $written;
            }
        }
        return $written;
    }
    ?>

    Note:

    在区分二进制文件和文本文件的系统上（如 Windows）打开文件时，fopen() 函数的
    mode 参数要加上 'b'。

    Note:

    If handle was fopen()ed in append mode, fwrite()s are atomic (unless the
    size of string exceeds the filesystem's block size, on some platforms, and
    as long as the file is on a local filesystem). That is, there is no need to
    flock() a resource before calling fwrite(); all of the data will be written
    without interruption.

    Note:

    If writing twice to the file pointer, then the data will be appended to the
    end of the file content:
    <?php
    $fp = fopen('data.txt', 'w');
    fwrite($fp, '1');
    fwrite($fp, '23');
    fclose($fp);

    // the content of 'data.txt' is now 123 and not 23!
    ?>

范例

Example #1 一个简单的 fwrite() 例子

<?php
$filename = 'test.txt';
$somecontent = "添加这些文字到文件\n";

// 首先我们要确定文件存在并且可写。
if (is_writable($filename)) {

    // 在这个例子里，我们将使用添加模式打开$filename，
    // 因此，文件指针将会在文件的末尾，
    // 那就是当我们使用fwrite()的时候，$somecontent将要写入的地方。
    if (!$handle = fopen($filename, 'a')) {
         echo "不能打开文件 $filename";
         exit;
    }

    // 将$somecontent写入到我们打开的文件中。
    if (fwrite($handle, $somecontent) === FALSE) {
        echo "不能写入到文件 $filename";
        exit;
    }

    echo "成功地将 $somecontent 写入到文件$filename";

    fclose($handle);

} else {
    echo "文件 $filename 不可写";
}
?>

After having problems with fwrite() returning 0 in cases where one would fully
expect a return value of false, I took a look at the source code for php's
fwrite() itself. The function will only return false if you pass in invalid
arguments. Any other error, just as a broken pipe or closed connection, will
result in a return value of less than strlen($string), in most cases 0.

Therefore, looping with repeated calls to fwrite() until the sum of number of
bytes written equals the strlen() of the full value or expecting false on error
will result in an infinite loop if the connection is lost.

This means the example fwrite_stream() code from the docs, as well as all the
"helper" functions posted by others in the comments are all broken. You *must*
check for a return value of 0 and either abort immediately or track a maximum
number of retries.

Below is the example from the docs. This code is BAD, as a broken pipe will
result in fwrite() infinitely looping with a return value of 0. Since the loop
only breaks if fwrite() returns false or successfully writes all bytes, an
infinite loop will occur on failure.

<?php
// BROKEN function - infinite loop when fwrite() returns 0s
function fwrite_stream($fp, $string) {
    for ($written = 0; $written < strlen($string); $written += $fwrite) {
        $fwrite = fwrite($fp, substr($string, $written));
        if ($fwrite === false) {
            return $written;
        }
    }
    return $written;
}
?>

<?php

$gfz =  filesize_dir("d:\\starwars.mkv"); // 11,5GB
echo 'Z:',$gfz,PHP_EOL;

$fz = fopen('d:\\test2.mkv', 'wb');
$fp = fopen('d:\\starwars.mkv', 'rb');
echo PHP_EOL;
$a = (float) 0;

    fwrite($fz, $l);

}

fclose($fp);
fclose($fz);

Some people say that when writing to a socket not all of the bytes requested to
be written may be written. You may have to call fwrite again to write bytes
that were not written the first time. (At least this is how the write() system
call in UNIX works.)

This is helpful code (warning: not tested with multi-byte character sets)

function fwrite_with_retry($sock, &$data)
{
    $bytes_to_write = strlen($data);
    $bytes_written = 0;

    while ( $bytes_written < $bytes_to_write )
    {
        if ( $bytes_written == 0 ) {
            $rv = fwrite($sock, $data);
        } else {
            $rv = fwrite($sock, substr($data, $bytes_written));
        }

        if ( $rv === false || $rv == 0 )
            return( $bytes_written == 0 ? false : $bytes_written );

        $bytes_written += $rv;
    }

    return $bytes_written;
}

Call this like so:

    $rv = fwrite_with_retry($sock, $request_string);

    if ( ! $rv )
        die("unable to write request_string to socket");
    if ( $rv != strlen($request_string) )
        die("sort write to socket on writing request_string");
===============================================================================

the fwrite output striped the slashes if without length argument given,
example:

<?php
$str = "c:\\01.txt";
$out = fopen("out.txt", "w");
fwrite($out, $str);
fclose($out);
?>

the out.txt will be:
c:^@1.txt
the '\\0' without escape will be '\0' ==> 0x00.

the correct one is change fwrite to:
fwrite($out, $str, strlen($str));
===============================================================================

If you write with the pointer in the middle of a file, it overwrites what's
there rather than shifting the rest of the file along.
===============================================================================

    fwrite($fz, $l);

Hope this helps other newbies.

If you are writing data to a txt file on a windows system and need a line
break. use \r\n . This will write hex OD OA.

i.e.
$batch_data= "some data... \r\n";
fwrite($fbatch,$batch_data);

The is the equivalent of opening a txt file in notepad pressing enter and the
end of the line and saving it.
===============================================================================

Use caution when using:

$content = fread($fh, filesize($fh)) or die "Error Reading";

This will cause an error if the file you are reading is zero length.

Intead use:

if ( false === fread($fh, filesize($fh)) ) die "Error Reading";

Thus it will be successful on reading zero bytes but detect and error returned
as FALSE.
===============================================================================

Be careful of using reserved Windows filenames in fwrite operations.

<?php
$fh = fopen('prn.txt', 'w');
fwrite($fh, 'wtf?');
echo 'done' . PHP_EOL;
?>

The above script will hang (tested on Windows 7) before it can echo 'done'.

This is due to another 'feature' of our favourite operating system where
filenames like prn.xxx, con.xxx, com1.xxx and aux.xxx (with xxx being any
filename extension) are Windows reserved device names. Attempts to create/read/
write to these files hangs the interpreter.
===============================================================================

Bad example!

The result of fwrite could be either FALSE or 0.

So it should be correctly:

if (false === fwrite($handle, $somecontent)) { ....
===============================================================================

I needed to append, but I needed to write on the file's beginning, and after
some hours of effort this worked for me:

$file = "file.txt";
if (!file_exists("file.txt")) touch("file.txt");
$fh = fopen("file.txt", "r");
$fcontent = fread($fh, filesize("file.txt"));

$towrite = "$newcontent $fcontent";

$fh22 = fopen('file.txt', 'w+');
fwrite($fh2, $towrite);
fclose($fh);
fclose($fh2);
===============================================================================

this the another sample to use fwrite with create a folder and create the txt
file.

<?php
$mypath="testdir\\subdir\\test";
mkdir($mypath,0777,TRUE);
$filename = $mypath.'\test.txt';
$handle = fopen($filename,"x+");
$somecontent = "Add this to the file Oktavianus";
fwrite($handle,$somecontent);
echo "Success";
fclose($handle);
?>

please try...
Oktavianus
===============================================================================

if (is_writable($filename)) {

Could also be

if (is_writable($filename) or die ("Can not write to ".$filename)) {
===============================================================================

If you are trying to write binary/structured data (e.g., a 4-byte sequence for
an (int)) to a file, you will need to use:
http://php.net/pack
===============================================================================

Using fwrite to write to a file in your include folder...

PHP does not recognise the permissions setting for the file until you restart
the server... this script works fine. (still have to create the blank text file
first though...it is not created automatically) On OS X Server..
Using the 1 in fopen tells php to look for the file in your include folder.
Change your include folder by altering include_path in php.ini
On OS X Server, php.ini is in private/etc/php.ini.default
copy the file and call it php.ini

the default include path is usr/lib/php
(All these folders are hidden - use TinkerTool to reveal them)

<?php
$file = fopen('textfile.txt', 'a', 1);
$text="\n Your text to write \n ".date('d')."-".date('m')."-".date('Y')."\n\n";
fwrite($file, $text);
fclose($file);
?>
===============================================================================

Don't forget to check fwrite returns for errors! Just because you successfully
opened a file for write, doesn't always mean you can write to it. 

On some systems this can occur if the filesystem is full, you can still open
the file and create the filesystem inode, but the fwrite will fail, resulting
in a zero byte file.
===============================================================================

I could'nt quite get MKP Dev hit counter to work.... this is how I modified it
<?
function hitcount()
{
$file = "counter.txt";
if ( !file_exists($file)){
        touch ($file);
        $handle = fopen ($file, 'r+'); // Let's open for read and write
        $count = 0;

}
else{
        $handle = fopen ($file, 'r+'); // Let's open for read and write
        $count = fread ($handle, filesize ($file));
        settype ($count,"integer");
}
rewind ($handle); // Go back to the beginning
/*
* Note that we don't have problems with 9 being fewer characters than
  * 10 because we are always incrementing, so we will always write at
   * least as many characters as we read
    **/
fwrite ($handle, ++$count); // Don't forget to increment the counter
fclose ($handle); // Done

return $count;
}     
?>
===============================================================================

Note that the optional $length argument is expected to be an int, and cannot be
skipped by passing null.

That is, `fwrite($handle, $string, null)` is treated as `fwrite($handle,
$string, 0)`, and will write zero bytes, not the whole string.
===============================================================================

In PHP 4.3.7 fwrite returns 0 rather than false on failure.
The following example will output "SUCCESS: 0 bytes written" for existing file
test.txt:

$fp = fopen("test.txt", "rw");
if (($bytes_written = fwrite($fp, "This is a test")) === false) {
  echo "Unable to write to test.txt\n\n";
} else {
  echo "SUCCESS: $bytes_written bytes written\n\n";
}
===============================================================================

For those who, like me, lost a lot of minutes (hours) to understand why fwrite
doesn't create a real utf-8 file, here's the explanation I've found :

I tried to do something like this :
<?php
$myString = utf8_encode("Test with accents éèàç");
$fh=fopen('test.xml',"w");
fwrite($fh,$myString);
fclose($fh);
?>

For a mysterious reason, the resulted file shows the accent without the utf-8
conversion.

I tried the binary, mode, etc. etc. And finally I've found it :
It seems that fwrite NEEDS to have the utf8_encode function INSIDE its
parameters like this, to understand it must create a non-text only file :
<?php
$myString = "Test with accents éèàç";
$fh=fopen('test.xml',"w");
fwrite($fh,utf8_encode($myString));
fclose($fh);
?>
Hope this will help
===============================================================================

[Ed. Note:
The runtime configuration setting auto_detect_line_endings should solve this
problem when set to On.]

I figured out problems when writing to a file using \r as linebreak, after that
file() wasn't able to read the data from that file.
Using \n solved the problem.
===============================================================================

Remember to check the return value of fwrite(). In particular, writing into a
socket can return fewer bytes than requested, and you'll have to try again with
the remainder of your data.
===============================================================================

if you want to create quickly and without fopen use system, exec

system('echo "blahblah" > /path/file');
===============================================================================

Use this to get a UTF-8 Unicode CSV file that opens properly in Excel:

$tmp = chr(255).chr(254).mb_convert_encoding( $tmp, 'UTF-16LE', 'UTF-8');
$write = fwrite( $filepath, $tmp );

Use a tab character, not comma, to seperate the fields in  the $tmp.

Credit for this goes to someone called Eugene Murai, I found this solution by
him after searching for several hours.
===============================================================================

Watch out for mistakes in writting a simple code for a hit counter:
<?php
$cont=fopen('cont.txt','r');
$incr=fgets($cont);
//echo $incr;
$incr++;
fclose($cont);
$cont=fopen('cont.txt','a');
fwrite($cont,$incr);
fclose($cont);
?>

Why? notice the second fopen -> $cont=fopen('cont.txt','a');
it opens the file in writting mode (a). And when it ads the incremented
value ( $incr ) it ads it ALONG the old value... so opening the counter
page about 5 times will make your hits number look like this
012131214121312151.21312141213E+ .... you get the piont.
nasty, isn't it? REMEMBER to open the file with the 'w' mode (truncate
the file to 0). Doing this will clear the file content and it will make sure
that
your counter works nice. This is the final code

<?php
$cont=fopen('cont.txt','r');
$incr=fgets($cont);
//echo $incr;
$incr++;
fclose($cont);
$cont=fopen('cont.txt','w');
fwrite($cont,$incr);
fclose($cont);
?>

Notice that this work fine =)

Here you have a function found on the website http://
softontherocks.blogspot.com/2014/11/
funcion-para-escribir-en-un-fichero-log.html with an example of how to make a
log file.

The function is this:

function writeLog($data) {
list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
$datetime = strftime("%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S",time());
$msg = "$datetime'". sprintf("%06s",intval($usec*1000000)).": $data";
$save_path = 'foo.txt';
$fp = @fopen($save_path, 'a'); // open or create the file for writing and
append info
fputs($fp, "$msg\n"); // write the data in the opened file
fclose($fp); // close the file
}
===============================================================================

[Editor's Note: No, you only need to use this if you want a BOM (Byte order
mark) added to the document - most people do not.]

if you have to write a file in UTF-8 format, you have to add an header to the
file like this :

<?php
$f=fopen("test.txt", "wb");
$text=utf8_encode(" a !");
// adding header
$text="\xEF\xBB\xBF".$text;
fputs($f, $text);
fclose($f);
?>
===============================================================================

bluevd at gmail dot com mentioned a hit counter. In his/her implementation, the
file is first opened, read, closed, then opened +truncated, then written, and
closed again. An alternative to this is:
<?php
$file = 'counter.txt or whatever';
$handle = fopen ($file, 'r+'); // Let's open for read and write
$count = int (fread ($handle, filesize ($file)));
// We don't want to think it's a string and try appending
echo "Number of hits $count";
rewind ($handle); // Go back to the beginning
/*
* Note that we don't have problems with 9 being fewer characters than
* 10 because we are always incrementing, so we will always write at
* least as many characters as we read
**/
fwrite ($handle, ++$count); // Don't forget to increment the counter
fclose ($handle); // Done
?>
===============================================================================

Remember to use double-quotes when outputting special characters such as \n or
they come out literally.

===============================================================================

For my fellow newbies, if you test the sample script and want to have the .txt
file created for you, you need to comment out the is_writable stuff, like
this: 

<?php
$filename = 'test.txt';
$somecontent = "Add this to the file\n";

// Let's make sure the file exists and is writable first.
//if (is_writable($filename)) {

// In our example we're opening $filename in append mode.
// The file pointer is at the bottom of the file hence
// that's where $somecontent will go when we fwrite() it.
if (!$handle = fopen($filename, 'a')) {
echo "Cannot open file ($filename)";
exit;
}

// Write $somecontent to our opened file.
if (fwrite($handle, $somecontent) === FALSE) {
echo "Cannot write to file ($filename)";
exit;
}

echo "Success, wrote ($somecontent) to file ($filename)";

fclose($handle);

//} else {
//echo "The file $filename is not writable";
//}
?>

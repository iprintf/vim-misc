pg_execute

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7)

pg_execute — Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given
parameters, and waits for the result.

说明

resource pg_execute ([ resource $connection ], string $stmtname , array $params
)

Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, and
waits for the result.

pg_execute() is like pg_query_params(), but the command to be executed is
specified by naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query
string. This feature allows commands that will be used repeatedly to be parsed
and planned just once, rather than each time they are executed. The statement
must have been prepared previously in the current session. pg_execute() is
supported only against PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher connections; it will fail when
using earlier versions.

The parameters are identical to pg_query_params(), except that the name of a
prepared statement is given instead of a query string.

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When connection is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by pg_connect() or pg_pconnect().

stmtname

    The name of the prepared statement to execute. if "" is specified, then the
    unnamed statement is executed. The name must have been previously prepared
    using pg_prepare(), pg_send_prepare() or a PREPARE SQL command.

params

    An array of parameter values to substitute for the $1, $2, etc.
    placeholders in the original prepared query string. The number of elements
    in the array must match the number of placeholders.

    Warning

    Elements are converted to strings by calling this function.

返回值

A query result resource on success 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 Using pg_execute()

<?php
// Connect to a database named "mary"
$dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");

// Prepare a query for execution
$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name = $1'
);

// Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
// the string "Joe's Widgets" in any way
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Joe's Widgets"));

// Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Clothes Clothes Clothes"));

?>

参见

  • pg_prepare() - Submits a request to create a prepared statement with the
    given parameters, and waits for completion.
  • pg_send_prepare() - Sends a request to create a prepared statement with the
    given parameters, without waiting for completion.
  • pg_query_params() - Submits a command to the server and waits for the
    result, with the ability to pass parameters separately from the SQL command
    text.

===============================================================================

I am not 100% sure in this, but pg_exec() could return 0 as Connection ID.

because of that i change some of my code like this:

$dbres = pg_exec($SQL);

if ($dbres === false){
        echo "DB is down";
        exit;
}else{
        //do something
}

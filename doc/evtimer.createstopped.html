EvTimer::createStopped — Creates EvTimer stopped watcher object

说明

final public static EvTimer EvTimer::createStopped ( double $after , double
$repeat , callable $callback [, mixed $data = NULL [, int $priority = 0 ]] )

Creates EvTimer stopped watcher object. Unlike EvTimer::__construct() , this
method doesn't start the watcher automatically.

参数

after

    Configures the timer to trigger after after seconds.

repeat

    If repeat is 0.0 , then it will automatically be stopped once the timeout
    is reached. If it is positive, then the timer will automatically be
    configured to trigger again every repeat seconds later, until stopped
    manually.

callback

    See Watcher callbacks .

data

    Custom data associated with the watcher.

priority

    Watcher priority

返回值

Returns EvTimer watcher object on success.

范例

Example #1 Monotor changes of /var/log/messages. Avoid missing updates by means
of one second delay

<?php
$timer = EvTimer::createStopped(0., 1.02, function ($w) {
    $w->stop();

    $stat = $w->data;

    // 1 second after the most recent change of the file
    printf("Current size: %ld\n", $stat->attr()['size']);
});

$stat = new EvStat("/var/log/messages", 0., function () use ($timer) {
    // Reset timer watcher
    $timer->again();
});

$timer->data = $stat;

Ev::run();
?>

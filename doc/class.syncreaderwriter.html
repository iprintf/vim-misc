The SyncReaderWriter class

(PECL sync >= 1.0.0)

简介

A cross-platform, native implementation of named and unnamed reader-writer
objects.

A reader-writer object allows many readers or one writer to access a resource.
This is an efficient solution for managing resources where access will
primarily be read-only but exclusive write access is occasionally necessary.

mcrypt_create_iv

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mcrypt_create_iv — 从随机源创建初始向量

说明

string mcrypt_create_iv ( int $size [, int $source = MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM ] )

从随机源创建初始向量。

初始向量只是为了给加密算法提供一个可用的种子，所以它不需要安全保护，你甚至可以
随同密文一起发布初始向量也不会对安全性带来影响。

参数

size

    初始向量大小。

source

    初始向量数据来源。可选值有： MCRYPT_RAND （系统随机数生成器）,
    MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM （从 /dev/random 文件读取数据）和 MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM （从
    /dev/urandom 文件读取数据）。在 Windows 平台，PHP 5.3.0 之前的版本中，仅支
    持 MCRYPT_RAND。

    请注意，在 PHP 5.6.0 之前的版本中，此参数的默认值为 MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM。

        Note: 需要注意的是，如果没有更多可用的用来产生随机数据的信息，那么
        MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM 可能进入阻塞状态。

返回值

返回初始向量。如果发生错误，则返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                                说明
5.6.0 source 参数的默认值是 MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM。
5.3.0 MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM 和 MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM 在 Windows 平台也可用了。
5.3.0 不再需要提前调用 srand() 函数，由本函数自动完成调用。

===============================================================================

In relation to all of the crypto "advice" seen here, my suggestion is that you
ignore most of it. Some of it is good, some of it is bad, but most of it skips
the critical issues.

I had hoped to write out a nice long explanation, but PHP's commenting system
tells me my essay is too long. Instead I will say this:

You should use CBC, with a randomly chosen IV that is unique per key, and you
should transmit that IV in the clear along with your ciphertext. You should
also perform an authenticity check of that entire data blob, using something
like HMAC-SHA256, with another independent key.

Here's the full-text of what I was going to write: http://pastebin.com/sN6buivY

If you're interested in this stuff, or just want more information, check out
the Wikipedia articles around block cipher modes, block ciphers, HMAC, etc.

I also suggest reading Practical Cryptography by Bruce Schneier, as well as
Cryptography Engineering by Niels Ferguson, both of which are very
easy-to-digest books on practical cryptography.
===============================================================================

>First, the IV should be random and variable. The whole >point of it is to
ensure that the same plaintext does not >encrypt to the same ciphertext every
time. You most >certainly do lose security if the IV is constant or public.

Wrong, Wrong WRONG! The initialization vector is ALLOWED to be PUBLIC! It is
generally sent along with the ciphertext, UNENCRYPTED.

>The ciphertext should be E(IV | plaintext, key)

Wrong again! The initialization vector is NOT prepended to the plaintext before
encryption. The IV is used to seed the feedback system! (which is why you don't
need one in ECB mode - there is no feedback)

>Second, the IV should not be part of the decryption >parameters at all. You
should be able to decrypt the cipher >text, throw away the initial vector at
the front w/o even >reading it, and have your plaintext:

Nope. You need to seed the feedback mechanism during decryption to the SAME
state as it was seeded during encryption. This means using the SAME IV!
===============================================================================

If you use /dev/random you need a well filled entropy pool or the application
will block until enough good entropy comes available
===============================================================================

From http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/GLOSSARY.HTM#IV (linked to above):

"While it is often said that IV values need only be random-like or
unpredictable, and need not be confidential, in the case of CBC mode, that
advice can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks on the first plaintext block. If a
MITM opponent knows the usual content of the first block, they can change the
IV to manipulate that block (and only that block) to deliver a different
address, or different dollar amounts, or different commands, or whatever. And
while the conventional advice is to use a MAC at a higher level to detect
changed plaintext, that is not always desirable or properly executed. But the
CBC first-block problem is easily solved at the CBC level simply by enciphering
the IV and otherwise keeping it confidential, and that can be reasonable even
when a MAC will be used later."
===============================================================================

It is important to note that all cipher modes except ecb require the same IV to
be used in decryption as was used in encryption.

You need to pass the key *and* the IV to your decrypt function. Initializing a
new IV in the decrypt routine will not work.

Since, "you even can send [the IV] along with your ciphertext without  loosing
security," a nice way to handle this is to prepend your IV to your ciphertext.
Since the IV is fixed-width, you can then easily recover the IV and original
ciphertext using mcrypt_get_iv_size() and substr().

Here is an example:

<?PHP
function my_encrypt($string,$key) {
   srand((double) microtime() * 1000000); //for sake of MCRYPT_RAND
   $key = md5($key); //to improve variance
  /* Open module, and create IV */
  $td = mcrypt_module_open('des', '','cfb', '');
  $key = substr($key, 0, mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($td));
  $iv_size = mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size($td);
  $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
  /* Initialize encryption handle */
   if (mcrypt_generic_init($td, $key, $iv) != -1) {

      /* Encrypt data */
      $c_t = mcrypt_generic($td, $string);
      mcrypt_generic_deinit($td);
      mcrypt_module_close($td);
       $c_t = $iv.$c_t;
       return $c_t;
   } //end if
}

function my_decrypt($string,$key) {
   $key = md5($key); //to improve variance
  /* Open module, and create IV */
  $td = mcrypt_module_open('des', '','cfb', '');
  $key = substr($key, 0, mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($td));
  $iv_size = mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size($td);
  $iv = substr($string,0,$iv_size);
  $string = substr($string,$iv_size);
  /* Initialize encryption handle */
   if (mcrypt_generic_init($td, $key, $iv) != -1) {

      /* Encrypt data */
      $c_t = mdecrypt_generic($td, $string);
      mcrypt_generic_deinit($td);
      mcrypt_module_close($td);
       return $c_t;
   } //end if
}
// to test:
//print my_decrypt(my_encrypt("Hello, world.","foo"),"foo");
?>
===============================================================================

This does NOT generate randomly distributed IV's on all systems and therefore
poses a big security risk. Using a script (based on the one that Alex Khimch's
posted on the rand() page) one can easily check this:

<?php

$td = mcrypt_module_open (MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, "", MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, "");
$iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size ($td), MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM);

// header("Content-type: image/png");
$img = imagecreatetruecolor(255,255);

$ink = imagecolorallocate($img,255,255,255);
for($i=0;$i<255;$i++) {
  for($j=0;$j<255;$j++) {
  $twobytes = substr ($iv, 0, 2);
  $iv = substr ($iv, 2);
  if (!strlen ($iv)) $iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size ($td), 
MCRYPT_RAND);

  imagesetpixel($img, ord($twobytes[0]), ord($twobytes[1]), $ink);
  }
}

imagepng($img);
imagedestroy($img);

?>

The resulting image should show random noise, but on the windows systems I
tested (running PHP 5.3.x) it showed very distinct patterns.
===============================================================================

Block ciphers, at their core, are a pair of transformation algorithms, called
transforms. One encrypts, one decrypts - in some cases the algorithms are one
and the same, but that's not important. A block transform takes a fixed-length
block of plaintext, transforms it using a secret key of some chosen size, and
produces an identical-length block of ciphertext. Or, of course, vice versa
(decryption).

The security model of a block cipher is, simplistically at least, defined to be
"if you encrypt one block of plaintext with a randomly chosen key, it will be
computationally infeasible for an attacker with knowledge of only the
ciphertext (i.e. he does not know the key) to discover information about the
contents of the plaintext". The reality is slightly different - there are also
clauses around knowing part of the plaintext and not being able to discover any
more of it - but that's another story.

Once you start encrypting more than one block of plaintext using the same block
transform and the same key, all bets are off. In the Electronic Codebook (ECB)
cipher mode, each block of plaintext is independently transformed using the
same key. This leads to a problem: identical plaintext blocks produce identical
ciphertext blocks, when the same key is used. This means that "patterns" in the
data can be seen, especially in data formats that have repeating patterns or
long sequences of identical data. This is best described visually, with an
ECB-encrypted bitmap. See the Wikipedia article on ECB for a demonstration of
this.

After profiling a rather large, dynamic website I maintain to determine the
cause of intermittent freezing in execution, I found that calls to
mcrypt_create_iv() using MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM as the source consistently halted
execution for anywhere from 0.2 to ~12 seconds per call, ironically at random.
I'm making the assumption that the halts were caused by insufficient random
input being currently available in /dev/random due to its intended function to
block until enough random input is provided back to the device. I've found it
to be sufficient for my needs to use a modified version of the
alt_mcrypt_create_iv() function found below.

Although untested, I assume using MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM or a combination of
MCRYPT_DEV_RAND with srand() would've solved the problem as well; I found out
after the fact that /dev/urandom's intended function is to seamlessly provide
cryptographically secure output from the random number generator when the /dev/
urandom buffer was empty, and MCRYPT_DEV_RAND would simply use the same rand()
function as alt_mcrypt_create_iv().

hans at illis dot nl's demonstration code is incorrect. In the loop, he uses:

$iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size ($td), MCRYPT_RAND);

When it should actually be:

$iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size ($td), MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM);

This produces consistent results on Windows.
===============================================================================

I encrypt a few items on a page in a project i am working on and I have found
the IV create function to introduce huge delays in rendering the page too (I
noticed someone else here had this problem).

It's quite common for a 4 second render time for what should be a snappy site.
I would recommend that if speed is essential that an alternative method be used
to create your IV (such as the one below if you feel it secure enough).

After using an alternative IV creation method my page went from a 4 second
render to a 0.01 second render time.

This is because of the fact, that (like described in the manual above) this
function does NOT reseed the random number generator, in contrary to rand().
Use srand() like suggested above to get correct IVs.
===============================================================================

Specify MCRYPT_RAND in the second parameter if this function randomly hangs in
your requests.
===============================================================================

note: if you are experiencing a problem about complaining that the second
parameter has to be a 'long' and you are giving a 'string' (for me, it was
using MCRYPT_URANDOM) you might want to try MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM :)

预定义常量

Flags passed to create a loop:

Ev::FLAG_AUTO

    The default flags value

Ev::FLAG_NOENV

    If this flag used(or the program runs setuid or setgid), libev won't look
    at the environment variable LIBEV_FLAGS . Otherwise(by default),
    LIBEV_FLAGS will override the flags completely if it is found. Useful for
    performance tests and searching for bugs.

Ev::FLAG_FORKCHECK

    Makes libev check for a fork in each iteration, instead of calling 
    EvLoop::fork() manually. This works by calling getpid() on every iteration
    of the loop, and thus this might slow down the event loop with lots of loop
    iterations, but usually is not noticeable. This flag setting cannot be
    overridden or specified in the LIBEV_FLAGS environment variable.

Ev::FLAG_NOINOTIFY

    When this flag is specified, libev won't attempt to use the inotify API for
    its » ev_stat watchers. The flag can be useful to conserve inotify file
    descriptors, as otherwise each loop using ev_stat watchers consumes one
    inotify handle.

Ev::FLAG_SIGNALFD

    When this flag is specified, libev will attempt to use the signalfd API for
    its » ev_signal (and » ev_child ) watchers. This API delivers signals
    synchronously, which makes it both faster and might make it possible to get
    the queued signal data. It can also simplify signal handling with threads,
    as long as signals are properly blocked in threads. Signalfd will not be
    used by default.

Ev::FLAG_NOSIGMASK

    When this flag is specified, libev will avoid to modify the signal mask.
    Specifically, this means having to make sure signals are unblocked before
    receiving them.

    This behaviour is useful for custom signal handling, or handling signals
    only in specific threads.

Flags passed to Ev::run() , or EvLoop::run()

Ev::RUN_NOWAIT

    Means that event loop will look for new events, will handle those events
    and any already outstanding ones, but will not wait and block the process
    in case there are no events and will return after one iteration of the
    loop. This is sometimes useful to poll and handle new events while doing
    lengthy calculations, to keep the program responsive.

Ev::RUN_ONCE

    Means that event loop will look for new events (waiting if necessary) and
    will handle those and any already outstanding ones. It will block the
    process until at least one new event arrives (which could be an event
    internal to libev itself, so there is no guarantee that a user-registered
    callback will be called), and will return after one iteration of the loop.

Flags passed to Ev::stop() , or EvLoop::stop()

Ev::BREAK_CANCEL

    Cancel the break operation.

Ev::BREAK_ONE

    Makes the innermost Ev::run() (or EvLoop::run() ) call return.

Ev::BREAK_ALL

    Makes all nested Ev::run() (or EvLoop::run() ) calls return.

Watcher priorities:

Ev::MINPRI

    Minimum allowed watcher priority.

Ev::MAXPRI

    Maximum allowed watcher priority.

Bit masks of (received) events:

Ev::READ

    The file descriptor in the EvIo watcher has become readable.

Ev::WRITE

    The file descriptor in the EvIo watcher has become writable.

Ev::TIMER

    EvTimer watcher has been timed out.

Ev::PERIODIC

    EvPeriodic watcher has been timed out.

Ev::SIGNAL

    A signal specified in EvSignal::__construct() has been received.

Ev::CHILD

    The pid specified in EvChild::__construct() has received a status change.

Ev::STAT

    The path specified in EvStat watcher changed its attributes.

Ev::IDLE

    EvIdle watcher works when there is nothing to do with other watchers.

Ev::PREPARE

    All EvPrepare watchers are invoked just before Ev::run() starts. Thus,
    EvPrepare watchers are the last watchers invoked before the event loop
    sleeps or polls for new events.

Ev::CHECK

    All EvCheck watchers are queued just after Ev::run() has gathered the new
    events, but before it queues any callbacks for any received events. Thus,
    EvCheck watchers will be invoked before any other watchers of the same or
    lower priority within an event loop iteration.

Ev::EMBED

    The embedded event loop specified in the EvEmbed watcher needs attention.

Ev::CUSTOM

    Not ever sent(or otherwise used) by libev itself, but can be freely used by
    libev users to signal watchers (e.g. via EvWatcher::feed() ).

Ev::ERROR

    An unspecified error has occurred, the watcher has been stopped. This might
    happen because the watcher could not be properly started because libev ran
    out of memory, a file descriptor was found to be closed or any other
    problem. Libev considers these application bugs. See also » ANATOMY OF A
    WATCHER

Backend flags:

Ev::BACKEND_SELECT

    select(2) backend

Ev::BACKEND_POLL

    poll(2) backend

Ev::BACKEND_EPOLL

    Linux-specific epoll(7) backend for both pre- and post-2.6.9 kernels

Ev::BACKEND_KQUEUE

    kqueue backend used on most BSD systems. EvEmbed watcher could be used to
    embed one loop(with kqueue backend) into another. For instance, one can try
    to create an event loop with kqueue backend and use it for sockets only.

Ev::BACKEND_DEVPOLL

    Solaris 8 backend. This is not implemented yet.

Ev::BACKEND_PORT

    Solaris 10 event port mechanism with a good scaling.

Ev::BACKEND_ALL

    Try all backends(even currupted ones). It's not recommended to use it
    explicitly. Bitwise operators should be applied here(e.g. Ev::BACKEND_ALL &
    ~ Ev::BACKEND_KQUEUE ) Use Ev::recommendedBackends() , or don't specify any
    backends at all.

Ev::BACKEND_MASK

    Not a backend, but a mask to select all backend bits from flags value to
    mask out any backends(e.g. when modifying the LIBEV_FLAGS environment
    variable).

    Note:

    For the default loop during module initialization phase Ev registers
    » ev_loop_fork call by means of pthread_atfork (if available).

    Note:

    There are methods providing access to the default event loop in Ev class
    (e.g. Ev::iteration() , Ev::depth() etc.) For custom loops (created with 
    EvLoop::__construct() ) these values may be accessed via corresponding
    properties and methods of the EvLoop class.

    The instance of the default event loop itself can be fetched by means of 
    EvLoop::defaultLoop() method.

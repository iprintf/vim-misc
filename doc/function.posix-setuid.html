posix_setuid

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

posix_setuid — Set the UID of the current process

说明

bool posix_setuid ( int $uid )

Set the real user ID of the current process. This is a privileged function that
needs appropriate privileges (usually root) on the system to be able to perform
this function.

参数

uid

    The user id.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 posix_setuid() example

This example will show the current user id and then set it to a different
value.

<?php
echo posix_getuid()."\n"; //10001
echo posix_geteuid()."\n"; //10001
posix_setuid(10000);
echo posix_getuid()."\n"; //10000
echo posix_geteuid()."\n"; //10000
?>

Note that on unix, if your target user does not have a valid shell, some php
functions (eg: tempnam) will not work correctly:

$ grep www-data /etc/passwd
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin

$ cat test.php
#!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php
    $info=posix_getpwnam("www-data");
    $id=$info["uid"];

    $file=tempnam("/tmp","something");
    print "PRE SetUID: $file\n";

    $SETUID=posix_setuid($id);

    $file=tempnam("/tmp","something");
    print "POST SetUID: $file\n";
?>

$ sudo ./test.php
PRE SetUID: /tmp/somethingrsb1qZ
POST SetUID:
===============================================================================

When you do a posix_setuid from root to some other users you will not have
access to files owned by root according to their permissions. For instance if
you change owner of the process and still need to open a file for read or write
with 600 permission owned by root you will receive a permission denied.
There are some ways to do this (i.e. a unix socket or tcp daemon etc), but
probably the most easiest way is:

Open the file before changing ownership of process, save the file pointer in a
global variable and use it after changing ownership.

For example assume /root/test_file is a file owned by root:root and have a
permission of 600 and you are running this script under root. This code will
not work:

<?php
// Change ownership of process to nobody
posix_setgid(99);
posix_setuid(99);

$fd = fopen('/root/test_file','a');
fwrite($fd,"some test strings");
fclose();

?>

But this one will work:

<?php
$fd = fopen('/root/test_file','a');

// Change ownership of process to nobody
posix_setgid(99);
posix_setuid(99);

fwrite($fd,"some test strings");
fclose();

?>

Hope this helps some one.

In response to a note above that advocated the user of system() in a setuid
program written in C, this is generally a bad idea for security. 

You should use the standard library calls like execl() instead because system()
can be manipulated to execute the wrong thing using the SHELL, IFS and possibly
other variables.
===============================================================================

On many UNIX systems (tested on Debian GNU/Linux), SUID is disabled for scripts
and works only for binaries. If you need to setuid, you must use a wrapper
binary that runs setuid() php script. Here's an example:

$ nano suexec.cpp
#include <stdlib>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
system("php /home/php/php_user.php");
return 0;
}

$ g++ -o suexec suexec.cpp
$ sudo chown root:root suexec
$ sudo chmod 4755 root

Then we create short PHP script to set process uid (you should already know how
to do this). Don't even try to experiment with auto_prepend_file in php.ini, it
doesn't work as expected.
===============================================================================

It seems like this function returns true if you try to change uid to the
already active user - even if you aren't root.

Should save you one if-statement in some cases.
===============================================================================

For simple operations, you can easily create a privilege-separation mechanism
to perform commands that require elevated privileges.

For example, in creating a document repository, I had the need to provide
access to certain directory and file operations based on a user's login name. 
It's unrealistic and unsecure to provide the web server access to all of the
directories that the user may need to access, so I created a setuid() script to
perform the required operations for me.

An exerpt from the code demonstrates this:

<?

//
// main.php
//

// Perform a privileged stat()
function privsep_stat($path)
{
        // Call the privilege separation program, ask for a stat of the
specified path
        $serialized_result = exec("/path/to/privsep.php stat " . $path, $oa,
$return_code);
        if ($return_code != 0)
        {
                return false;
        }

        // Return the unserialized object
        return unserialize($serialized_result);
}

// Get file statistics on a file we don't have access to as the web server user
$st = privsep_stat("/private_directory/private_file");
print_r($st);

?>

privsep.php looks like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/php
<?

//
// privsep.php
//

// Don't allow this script to be run from the web
if (isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']))
{
    print "<br>This program is not intended to be run directly from the WWW.\
n";
    return 1;
}

// TODO: add your argument validation here

// A stat was requested
if ($argv[1] == "stat")
{
    // Reset the stat() cache
    clearstatcache();

    // Original user ID
    $original_uid = posix_get_uid();

    // Set our real user ID to root
    $success = posix_setuid(0);
    if (!$success)
    {
        print "Error: Cannot setuid().\n";
        return 1;
    }

    // Store the file statistics
    $st = stat($argv[2]);

    // Drop the real UID back to the calling user ID
    $success = posix_setuid($original_uid);
    if (!$success)
    {
        print "Error: Cannot setuid().\n";
        return 1;
    }

    // Drop the effective UID as well
    $success = posix_seteuid($original_uid);
    if (!$success)
    {
        print "Error: Cannot seteuid().\n";
        return 1;
    }

    // Serialize the result and print it
    $result = serialize($st);
    print $result;

    // Success!
    return 0;
}
?>

Finally, privsep.php's permissions are configured like this:

# chown root:wheel privsep.php
# chmod 4755 privsep.php

And look like this:

-rwsr-xr-x  1 root      wheel     1000 Nov  1 00:00 privsep.php

It's probably wise to keep privsep.php out of your document root to help
mitigate any successful attack.

This method can be extended for other functions.  Use at your own risk.

Here's some Perl code to run a PHP script setuid. Just put it into a CGI, make
that CGI setuid and executable, then call the CGI where you would usually call
the PHP script.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

# Perl wrapper to execute a PHP script setuid
#  2002 Simon Kornblith
# Requires PHP CGI

# Make UID = EUID (so that PHP can run system()s and execs() setuid)
$< = $>;
# Set this to the path, so that we can't get poisoned
$ENV{'PATH'} = "/home/httpd/cgi-bin/ssl/admin";     
# Open the PHP script (must start with !#/usr/local/bin/php or similar and
# be executable
open(STDOUT, "| /home/httpd/cgi-bin/ssl/admin/new.php");
# Write STDIN to PHP script
print while <STDIN>;

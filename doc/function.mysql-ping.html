When using the mysql_ping command under php 5.1.2 and mysql 5.0, I was having
problems with the auto-reconnect "feature", mainly that when the connection was
severed, a mysql_ping would not automatically re-establish the connection to
the database.

The connection to the DB is dropped when the time without a query excedes the
wait_timeout value in my.cnf. You can check your wait_timeout by running the
query "SHOW VARIABLES;"

If you're having problems auto-reconnecting when the connection is dropped, use
this code:

<?php

$conn = mysql_connect('localhost','user','pass');
mysql_select_db('db',$conn);

if (!mysql_ping ($conn)) {
   //here is the major trick, you have to close the connection (even though its
not currently working) for it to recreate properly.
   mysql_close($conn);
   $conn = mysql_connect('localhost','user','pass');
   mysql_select_db('db',$conn);
}

//run queries knowing that your connection is alive....

?>
===============================================================================

When checking if a $resource works...
be prepared that mysql_ping returns NULL as long as $resource is no correct
mysql resource.
<?php
$resource =NULL;
var_dump = @mysql_ping($resource);
# showing NULL
?>
This could be used to decide of a current $resource is a mysql or a mysqli
connection when nothing else is available to do that...
===============================================================================

It should be noted that mysql_ping() seems to reset the error message on the
server.
I used it to check whether the connection was still alive before reading the
error message via mysql_error() and it always returned an empty string. Upon
removing the connection check everything worked.
===============================================================================

mysql_ping() is really helpful when you have this annoying error:

MYSQL Error 2006 Server has gone away

For CI users:
In 1.7.2 version of codeigniter, there is a function

$this->db->reconnect()

that uses mysql_ping() to reestablish the timed out connection.

This function is specially useful when developing social media sites that uses
hundreds of connections to the db such asinserting or selecting.
===============================================================================

Is important to remember that if your first connection to mysql don't works,
mysql_ping will always return true! So, if you want to check if mysql is
connected, first of all you must check if mysql_connect do not returns false
and then you can begin to check mysql_ping.
===============================================================================

This function *does not* attempt to reconnect at this time.  It only tells you
whether or not you currently *are* connected.

To actually reconnect, you will have to implement this yourself in a wrapper
class.
===============================================================================

If you get 'error 2006: MySQL server has gone away' messages when running
(really) long scripts, mysql_ping will help detecting the loss of the
db-connection. This can happen, when 'wait timeout' is reached (MySQL default
is 8 hours).

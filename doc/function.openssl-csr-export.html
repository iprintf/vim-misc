===============================================================================

Here you come with the example of how to use this function.

if( $csr = openssl_csr_new( array(
     "countryName"=>"PL",
     "stateOrProvinceName" => "blah",
     "organizationName" => "company ltd",
     "commonName"=>"foo.bar.com",
     "Email"=>"blah@foo.bar.com"), $privkey )
                  )
   {
   openssl_csr_export_to_file( $csr, "out.csr");
   }
else
   {
   printf("failed\n");
   }

Keep in mind that keys are case sensitive (i.e. give "email" instead of "Email"
and you get warning). Also remember it's important to keep the order of the
arguments in array. Move the "Email" above commonName and check what you get
(in case you don't know how: "openssl req -noout -text -in out.csr").

It also happened to me me I got segfault when order was rubbish (afair Email
after countryName, or plenty Email's here and there), so be awared.

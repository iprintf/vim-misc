yaml_parse_file — Parse a YAML stream from a file

说明

mixed yaml_parse_file ( string $filename [, int $pos = 0 [, int &$ndocs [, 
array $callbacks ]]] )

Convert all or part of a YAML document stream read from a file to a PHP
variable.

参数

filename

    Path to the file.

pos

    Document to extract from stream (-1 for all documents, 0 for first
    document, ...).

ndocs

    If ndocs is provided, then it is filled with the number of documents found
    in stream.

callbacks

    Content handlers for YAML nodes. Associative array of YAML tag => callable
    mappings. See parse callbacks for more details.

返回值

Returns the value encoded in input in appropriate PHP type 或者在失败时返回
FALSE. If pos is -1 an array will be returned with one entry for each document
found in the stream.

注释

Warning

Processing untrusted user input with yaml_parse_file() is dangerous if the use
of unserialize() is enabled for nodes using the !php/object tag. This behavior
can be disabled by using the yaml.decode_php ini setting.

===============================================================================

This is entirely dependent on type detection - as far as I can find there is no
way to force a type and for instance when you have a very long integer as a
value - in my case 1313035348823 it gets limited to 2147483647 - PHP's max
integer.
===============================================================================

As Jesse Donat mentioned the type will be infered automatically. To enforce
some type you can use the callback facility like this:

<?php
function cb_yaml_date($value, $tag, $flags) {
    return new DateTime($value);
}

$yaml = <<<YAML
event1:
  name: My Event
  date: !date 25.05.2001
YAML;

$ndocs = 0;
$data = yaml_parse($yaml, 0, $ndocs, array('!date' => 'cb_yaml_date'));

print_r($data);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

    Array
    (
        [event1] => Array
            (
                [name] => My Event
                [date] => DateTime Object
                    (
                        [date] => 2001-05-25 00:00:00
                        [timezone_type] => 3
                        [timezone] => Europe/Berlin
                    )
   
            )
   
    )

BTW if you want to have large numbers you are probably using BC Math. Thus, you
simple enclose your number in quotes:

<?php
$yaml = <<<YAML
largenumber: '14695760472279668267313200104308'
YAML;
?>

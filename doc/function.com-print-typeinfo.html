com_print_typeinfo

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

com_print_typeinfo — Print out a PHP class definition for a dispatchable
interface

说明

bool com_print_typeinfo ( object $comobject [, string $dispinterface [, bool
$wantsink = false ]] )

The purpose of this function is to help generate a skeleton class for use as an
event sink. You may also use it to generate a dump of any COM object, provided
that it supports enough of the introspection interfaces, and that you know the
name of the interface you want to display.

参数

comobject

    comobject should be either an instance of a COM object, or be the name of a
    typelibrary (which will be resolved according to the rules set out in 
    com_load_typelib()).

dispinterface

    The name of an IDispatch descendant interface that you want to display.

wantsink

    If set to TRUE, the corresponding sink interface will be displayed instead.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

com_print_typeinfo is really useful if you're trying to figure out what
properties and methods you have access to.  For example, I might do:

<?php
    $oExplorer = new COM("Shell.Application");
    com_print_typeinfo($oExplorer);
?>

The first line shows me the class of the object (what VBScript calls
'typename'), in my case IShellDispatch4.  It's frequently the case that if you
plunk that in as the second argument to com_print_typeinfo, you get way more
methods/properties coming back.  Thus:

<?php
    $oExplorer = new COM("Shell.Application");
    com_print_typeinfo($oExplorer, "IShellDispatch4");
?>

Furthermore, you might get additional functions listed if you try lower number
suffixes (or not).  At any rate, it would be useful for PHP to have a typename
function like VBScript does.  For example, if you iterate through the Windows
of $oExplorer you get both IE and Explorer windows and typename is the easy way
to differentiate between them.  Here's what I'm using:

<?php
    function typeName($objCOM) {
    if (empty($objCOM)) return "no COM object";
    if (gettype($objCOM)!="object") return "not a COM object";
    ob_start();
    com_print_typeinfo($objCOM);
    $typeInfo = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    $pattern = "/^\\s*class (.*) \\{/";
    if (!($matchCnt = preg_match($pattern, $typeInfo, $aMatch))) return "Not
found";
    return $aMatch[1];
}
?>

In my particular version of PHP, the second and third arguments are not, in
fact, optional.

Passing in '' for both, however, yielded a bucketful of information.

YMMV

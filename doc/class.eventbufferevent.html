The EventBufferEvent class

(PECL event >= 1.2.6-beta)

简介

Represents Libevent's buffer event.

Usually an application wants to perform some amount of data buffering in
addition to just responding to events. When we want to write data, for example,
the usual pattern looks like:

 1. Decide that we want to write some data to a connection; put that data in a
    buffer.

 2. Wait for the connection to become writable

 3. Write as much of the data as we can

 4. Remember how much we wrote, and if we still have more data to write, wait
    for the connection to become writable again.

This buffered I/O pattern is common enough that Libevent provides a generic
mechanism for it. A "buffer event" consists of an underlying transport (like a
socket), a read buffer, and a write buffer. Instead of regular events, which
give callbacks when the underlying transport is ready to be read or written, a
buffer event invokes its user-supplied callbacks when it has read or written
enough data.

属性

fd

    Numeric file descriptor associated with the buffer event. Normally
    represents a bound socket. Equals to NULL, if there is no file descriptor
    (socket) associated with the buffer event.

priority

    The priority of the events used to implement the buffer event.

input

    Underlying input buffer object( EventBuffer )

output

    Underlying output buffer object( EventBuffer )

预定义常量

EventBufferEvent::READING

    An event occured during a read operation on the bufferevent. See the other
    flags for which event it was.

EventBufferEvent::WRITING

    An event occured during a write operation on the bufferevent. See the other
    flags for which event it was.

EventBufferEvent::EOF

    Got an end-of-file indication on the buffer event.

EventBufferEvent::ERROR

    An error occurred during a bufferevent operation. For more information on
    what the error was, call EventUtil::getLastSocketErrno() and/or 
    EventUtil::getLastSocketError() .

EventBufferEvent::TIMEOUT

EventBufferEvent::CONNECTED

    Finished a requested connection on the bufferevent.

EventBufferEvent::OPT_CLOSE_ON_FREE

    When the buffer event is freed, close the underlying transport. This will
    close an underlying socket, free an underlying buffer event, etc.

EventBufferEvent::OPT_THREADSAFE

    Automatically allocate locks for the bufferevent, so that it’s safe to use
    from multiple threads.

EventBufferEvent::OPT_DEFER_CALLBACKS

    When this flag is set, the bufferevent defers all of its callbacks. See
    » Fast portable non-blocking network programming with Libevent, Deferred
    callbacks .

EventBufferEvent::OPT_UNLOCK_CALLBACKS

    By default, when the bufferevent is set up to be threadsafe, the buffer
    event’s locks are held whenever the any user-provided callback is invoked.
    Setting this option makes Libevent release the buffer event’s lock when
    it’s invoking the callbacks.

EventBufferEvent::SSL_OPEN

    The SSL handshake is done

EventBufferEvent::SSL_CONNECTING

    SSL is currently performing negotiation as a client

EventBufferEvent::SSL_ACCEPTING

    SSL is currently performing negotiation as a server

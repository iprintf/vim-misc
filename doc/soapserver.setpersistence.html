SoapServer::setPersistence

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.2, PHP 7)

SoapServer::setPersistence — Sets SoapServer persistence mode

说明

public void SoapServer::setPersistence ( int $mode )

This function allows changing the persistence state of a SoapServer object
between requests. This function allows saving data between requests utilizing
PHP sessions. This method only has an affect on a SoapServer after it has
exported functions utilizing SoapServer::setClass().

    Note:

    The persistence of SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION makes only objects of the given
    class persistent, but not the class static data. In this case, use $this->
    bar instead of self::$bar.

    Note:

    SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION serializes data on the class object between
    requests. In order to properly utilize resources (e.g. PDO), __wakeup() and
    __sleep() magic methods should be utilized.

参数

mode

    One of the SOAP_PERSISTENCE_XXX constants.

    SOAP_PERSISTENCE_REQUEST - SoapServer data does not persist between
    requests. This is the default behavior of any SoapServer object after
    setClass is called.

    SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION - SoapServer data persists between requests. This
    is accomplished by serializing the SoapServer class data into $_SESSION
    ['_bogus_session_name'], because of this session_start() must be called
    before this persistence mode is set.

返回值

没有返回值。

范例

Example #1 SoapServer::setPersistence() example

<?php
 class MyFirstPersistentSoapServer {
     private $resource; // (Such as PDO, mysqli, etc..)
     public $myvar1;
     public $myvar2;

     public function __construct() {
         $this->__wakeup(); //
 We're calling our wakeup to handle starting our resource
     }

     public function __wakeup() {
         $this->resource = CodeToStartOurResourceUp();
     }

     public function __sleep() {
         //
 We make sure to leave out $resource here, so our session data remains persistent
         //
 Failure to do so will result in the failure during the unserialization of data
         // on the next request;
 thus, our SoapObject would not be persistent across requests.
         return array('myvar1','myvar2');
     }
 }

 try {
     session_start();
     $server = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']));
     $server->setClass('MyFirstPersistentSoapServer');
     // setPersistence MUST be called after setClass, because setClass's
     // behavior sets SESSION_PERSISTENCE_REQUEST upon enacting the method.
     $server->setPersistence(SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION);
     $server->handle();
 } catch(SoapFault $e) {
     error_log("SOAP ERROR: ". $e->getMessage());
 }
?>

I want to give one example for the order of commands if you want to use a class
in persistence mode.

<?php
// 1. class definition or include
class UserService
{
    public function __construct() { }
}

// 2. start the session after defining or including the class!!
session_start();

// 3. instanciate the server
$server = new SoapServer(null, array("something"));

// 4. set the class to use
$server->setClass('UserService');

// 5. set persistance mode
$server->setPersistence(SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION);

// 6. handle the request
$server->handle();
?>

setPersistence works only for a single instance of service class.

To use multiple instance of services objects, you need to instantiate the
classes into objects and use an undocumented SoapServer's method - setObject()
to add the service object into the SoapServer object, and handle the service
object persistence with $_SESSION instead.

For example:

$ServiceObjects = array()
$ServiceObjects[0] = new ServiceClass1();
$ServiceObjects[1] = new ServiceClass2();
$ServiceObjects[2] = new ServiceClass3();

$_SESSION['ServiceClass1'] = $ServiceObjects[0];
$_SESSION['ServiceClass2'] = $ServiceObjects[1];
$_SESSION['ServiceClass3'] = $ServiceObjects[2];

...

$Servers = array()
for ( $i = 0; $i < count($ServiceObjects); i++)
{
  $s = new SoapServer($wsdl);
  $s->setObject($ServiceObject[$i]);
  $Servers[] = $s;
}

...

$Server[$i]->handle()

I found that using both modes (SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION and
SOAP_PERSISTENCE_REQUEST) cannot be used simultaniously. Because it didn't work
at once, I started experimenting by using different settings and as stated
below in the comments, "...also use SOAP_PERSISTENCE_REQUEST to save objects
between requests" led me to think it was nessecary to use both modes. Well, it
might for others, be but for me it turned out a day of freaking out ;) (trying
all kinds of session stuff, etc etc).
Also, if persistence doesn't work, please check if session_start() is called
somewhere in the script and try not to call it twice or whatsoever: it won't
work...
===============================================================================

I had some issues getting session persistence (SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION) to
work. I finally got it working after setting session.auto_start=0, and then
only calling session_start() in the script containing the SoapServer. Maybe
this is obvious, but took me a bit to figure it out.

I only tried it with session.use_cookies=1, so if the settings above don't work
for you, make sure cookies are enabled, though it may work without the need for
cookies.
===============================================================================

Always remember to place the "setPersistence" method before the handle method,
otherwise it won't work.  It sounds obvious, but it's still a very common
mistake, since no errors are shown.
===============================================================================

When using "SoapServer::setPersistence( SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION )", you
apparently MUST include the class that was used in "SoapServer::setClass()"
BEFORE any "session_*" commands.

I found this out using "__autoload()" and a whole lot of "syslog()"; it kept
failing to include the class that I was using for my soap server, but that
class is ONLY ever referenced by the page itself, and even then only for the
purposes of setting the class for the soap server; none of my code would ever
cause it to autoload.  The problem was that I was including my session-handling
code first.

If the session gets started BEFORE the page defines the class definition, then
persistence CANNOT happen.

The order should be:
1. Include the class for use with the soap server.
2. Start up your session.
3. Set up your soap server.
4. Handle your soap request.

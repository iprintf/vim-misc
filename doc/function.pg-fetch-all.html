pg_fetch_all

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_fetch_all — 从结果中提取所有行作为一个数组

说明

array pg_fetch_all ( resource $result )

pg_fetch_all() 从结果资源中返回一个包含有所有的行（元组/记录）的数组。如果没有
更多行可供提取，则返回 FALSE。

Example #1 pg_fetch_all() 例子

<?php
$conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=publisher");
if (!$conn) {
    echo "An error occured.\n";
    exit;
}
$result = pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM authors");
if (!$result) {
    echo "An error occured.\n";
    exit;
}
$arr = pg_fetch_all($result);
var_dump($arr);
?>

===============================================================================

Also for those who are trying to move off oracle, pg_fetch_all returns an array
with rows and columns inverted in the sense of ocifetchall. You would need to
transpose this result array before your code takes the first index a column
name and the second index a row index.
===============================================================================

Be aware that pg_fetch_all() is subject to the same limitations as
pg_fetch_assoc(), in that if your query returns multiple columns with the same
name (or alias) then only the rightmost one will be returned in the associative
array, other ones will not.

A simple example:
<?php
$res = pg_query(
"SELECT a.*, b.* -- Fetch all columns from both tables
FROM table1 AS a

LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 as b
USING (column)"
);

$rows = pg_fetch_all($res);
?>

In this example, since we're selecting columns via *, if any columns from
table2 share the same names as those in table1, they will be the ones returned
despite that table2 (as the optional side of an outer join) may return NULL
values.

This is not a bug, just a limitation of associative arrays in general, and is
easy enough to avoid by structuring your queries carefully and using column
aliases to avoid confusion.
===============================================================================

For versions of PHP that don't yet support the new names or newer functions I
wrote a couple functions like this one

if (! function_exists("pg_fetch_all")) {
  function pg_fetch_all($res, $kind="assoc") {
    $i = 0; // this is needed for the row integer in the looped pg_fetch_array
    if ($kind == "assoc") {
      while ($row = pg_fetch_array($res, $i, PGSQL_ASSOC)) {
        $array_out[] = $row;
        $i++;
    }else{
      while ($row = pg_fetch_array($res)) {
        $array_out[] = $row;
      }
    }
    return $array_out;
  }
}
===============================================================================

pg_fetch_all, despite the app note, accepts only one argument, the resultset.
It does exactly what is expected, returning a two-dimensional array of the
resultset. I suspect the app note given was just copied from pg_fetch_array,
which is what you want to use for a single row.
===============================================================================

For those wondering, this function returns a two-dimentional array, the first
dimension being a 0-based indexed array, the second dimension an associative. 
So you might access the first authors surname using $authors[0]["surname"]. 

Certainly this is the case in PHP 5.2.9, I can't vouch for other versions
though.
===============================================================================

It seems like pg_fetch_all() only works on version 4.3.x. I tried it with 4.2.2
and it does not recognize the function, so I assume it won't work on 4 =>
4.2.x.
===============================================================================

If you configure in your pg_hba.conf file a connection by the md5 method and
you didn't setup a password for that user, you must define a password by the
"alter role" PostgreSQL command:

alter role user_name encrypted password 'user_password';

Also, if you is connecting by type TCP/IP (host) and your IP address is another
than (localhost), as example (127.0.1.1) you must uncomment the following line
at postgresql.conf file, adding your IP address:

listen_addresses = 'localhost,127.0.1.1'

After save the new configuration, you must restart your PostgreSQL service.
===============================================================================

This function returns NULL if the parameter is false.

get_included_files

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

get_included_files — 返回被 include 和 require 文件名的 array

说明

array get_included_files ( void )

返回所有被 include、 include_once、 require 和 require_once 的文件名。

返回值

返回所有文件名称的 array。

脚本最初被称为”被包含的文件“，所以脚本自身也会和 include 系列函数引用的脚本列在
一起。

被多次 include 和 require 的文件在返回的 array 里只会列出一次。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      在 PHP 4.0.1 和之前的版本，本函数会假设所有被 required 的文件以 .php 结尾
4.0.1 ；其他扩展名结尾的文件不会被返回。get_included_files() 返回的 array 仅仅
      列出被 include 和 include_once 所包含的文件。

范例

Example #1 get_included_files() 范例

<?php
// 本文件是 abc.php

include 'test1.php';
include_once 'test2.php';
require 'test3.php';
require_once 'test4.php';

$included_files = get_included_files();

foreach ($included_files as $filename) {
    echo "$filename\n";
}

?>

以上例程会输出：

abc.php
test1.php
test2.php
test3.php
test4.php

注释

    Note:

    使用 auto_prepend_file 配置指令所包含的文件不会包含在返回的数组里。

===============================================================================

As of PHP5, this function seems to return an array with the first index being
the script all subsequent scripts are included to.
If index.php includes b.php and c.php and calls get_included_files(), the
returned array looks as follows:

index.php
a.php
b.php

while in PHP<5 the array would be:

a.php
b.php

If you want to know which is the script that is including current script you
can use $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] or any other similar server global.

If you also want to ensure current script is being included and not run
independently you should evaluate following expression:

__FILE__ != $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']

If this expression returns TRUE, current script is being included or required.
===============================================================================

If you have a MAIN php script which you don't want to be included by other
scripts, you could use this function. For example:

main.php:
<?php
function blockit()
{
  $buf = get_included_files();
  return $buf[0] != __FILE__;
}

blockit() and exit("You can not include a MAIN file as a part of your script."
);

print "OK";
?>

So other script couldn't include main.php to modify its internal global vars.
===============================================================================

As is often the case, YMMV.  I tried the __FILE__ and SCRIPT_FILENAME
comparison and found this:

SCRIPT_FILENAME: /var/www/cgi-bin/php441
__FILE__: /raid/home/natpresch/natpresch/RAY_included.php

As an alternative:

count(get_included_files());

Gives one when the script is standalone and always more than one when the
script is included.
===============================================================================

In 5.4.37, list entries are the full pathname to the script.
        /home/physpics/physpics.com/test/xxxDefiner.php
===============================================================================

This function aims to perform filtering of files that have been included :

<?php
function setIncludeFiles($arrayInc = array()){
    $incFiles = get_included_files();
    if((count($arrayInc)>0)&&(count($incFiles)>0)){
        $aInt = array_intersect($arrayInc,$incFiles);
        if(count($aInt)>0){
            return false;
       }elseif(count($aInt)<1) {
        foreach($arrayInc as $inc){
            if(is_file($inc))
                include($inc);
            else{
                return false;
            }
        }
       }   
    }else{
        return false;
    }
}
?>

Usage :

<?php
$toBeInclude = array('/data/your_include_files_1.php',
'/data/your_include_files_2.php',
'/data/your_include_files_3.php',
);
setIncludeFiles($toBeInclude);
?>

Return false if something goes wrong.
===============================================================================

Something that's not noted in the docs, if a file is included remotely and you
do a get_included_files() in the include itself it will *not* return the
document that included it.

ie:
test2.php (server 192.168.1.14):
<?php

include("http://192.168.1.11/test/test3.php");

?>

test3.php (server 192.168.1.11):

<?php

$files = get_included_files();

print_r($files);
?>

returns:

Array ( [0] => /var/www/localhost/htdocs/test/test3.php )

Which means you can use get_included_files() to help intercept and prevent
XSS-style attacks against your code.

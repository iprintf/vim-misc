bool intlcal_get_minimal_days_in_first_week ( IntlCalendar $cal , int
$minimalDays )

Sets the smallest number of days the first week of a year or month must have in
the new year or month. For instance, in the Gregorian calendar, if this value
is 1, then the first week of the year will necessarily include January 1st,
while if this value is 7, then the week with January 1st will be the first week
of the year only if the day of the week for January 1st matches the day of the
week returned by IntlCalendar::getFirstDayOfWeek(); otherwise it will be the
previous yearʼs last week.

参数

cal

    The IntlCalendar resource.

minimalDays

    The number of minimal days to set.

返回值

TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.

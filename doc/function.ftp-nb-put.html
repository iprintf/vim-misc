ftp_nb_put

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ftp_nb_put — 存储一个文件至 FTP 服务器（non-blocking）

说明

int ftp_nb_put ( resource $ftp_stream , string $remote_file , string
$local_file , int $mode [, int $startpos ] )

ftp_nb_put() 函数用来把本地文件 local_file 存储到 FTP 服务器上由 remote_file 参
数指定的路径。传输模式参数 mode 只能为 FTP_ASCII (文本模式) 或 FTP_BINARY (二进
制模式) 两种。与函数 ftp_put() 不同的是，此函数上传文件的时候采用的是异步传输模
式，也就意味着在文件传送的过程中，你的程序可以继续干其它的事情。

返回 FTP_FAILED，FTP_FINISHED 或 FTP_MOREDATA。

Example #1 ftp_nb_put() 实例

<?php
// 开始上传
$ret = ftp_nb_put($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", FTP_BINARY);
while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {

   // 在这里可以加入其它代码
   echo ".";

   // 继续传送...
   $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);
}
if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {
   echo "上传文件中发生错误...";
   exit(1);
}
?>

Example #2 使用 ftp_nb_put() 来断线续传

<?php
// 开始
$ret = ftp_nb_put ($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local",
                      FTP_BINARY, ftp_size("test.remote"));
// 或: $ret = ftp_nb_put ($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local",
//                           FTP_BINARY, FTP_AUTORESUME);

while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {

   // 加入其它要执行的代码
   echo ".";

   // 继续传送...
   $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);
}
if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {
   echo "上传文件中发生错误...";
   exit(1);
}
?>

How to realize the possibility of transferring data from one FTP-server to
another via FXP:

<?php
// ...

$ansver = ftp_raw($ftp_conn1, 'PASV');

if (intval($ansver[0]) == 227) {
    ftp_raw($ftp_conn2, 'PORT '.substr($ansver[0], $n = strpos($ansver[0], '(')
+ 1, strpos($m[0], ')', $n) - $n));
    ftp_raw($ftp_conn1, 'STOR '.$filename); // need asynchronously
(non-blocking)
    ftp_raw($ftp_conn2, 'RETR '.$filename);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Don't add a sleep() inside the loop. If you do you will severely slow down the
upload.

In my tests, each time through the loop it send about 2.5K, looping about 220
times per second. (Which is very little.)

You won't necessarily get the same numbers as me per loop, but clearly PHP does
it's own management of the loop so that you don't consume all the CPU on the
server.
===============================================================================

If you receive an error like: 

Warning:  ftp_nb_put(): Unable to service PORT commands in /path/to/file.php on
line 27

verify whether you need to be in PASV mode. You can go into PASV mode by
declaring

>  ftp_pasv($cnx,TRUE);

When using non blocking functions if you try to disconnect while your non
blocking operation is in progress the disconnect command will not work until
the operation is not finished.

I couldn't see this noted anywhere...

ftp_nb_put apparently takes a much much longer time to upload the file than
ftp_put (I haven't done any packet sniffing or logging tests to find out why). 
I was using a script, nearly identical to the example above, and a 100KB file
had only uploaded 3.99KB after about 8 minutes!  The php script naturally timed
out before it was complete.

I changed my function to use ftp_put, got rid of the loop to check FTP_MOREDATA
(as you will see in the example above), and the same script uploaded 2.2MB
within 30 seconds with no other changes.

If you're using this function instead of ftp_put *purely to try to speed up
your script* and it's taking a long time, you might want to try ftp_put
instead.
===============================================================================

Hi,
I tried to use both ftp_put() and ftp_nb_put() adding the
variable $start = date("Y:m:d h:i:s"); at the begin of the script and the
variable $end = date("Y:m:d h:i:s"); at its end, after the file upload
function.
With the gprs connection I'm now using and trying to upload a .jpg file of 67,5
kb the time difference between $start and $end was 40 seconds in both cases, so
I can suppose that there is no difference between these upload function.
The difference comes if you put anything inside the while ($ftp_upload ==
FTP_MOREDATA) loop.
I hope this note can help.
Regards

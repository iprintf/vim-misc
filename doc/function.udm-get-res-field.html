===============================================================================

Use the function udm_get_res_field_ex() to fetch "non-standard" sections.

Example:

<?php
$tags = udm_get_res_field_ex($agent, $row, "meta.mytag");
?>
===============================================================================

It seems the description length is now determined by UDM_MAXDESCSIZE in
udm_common.h instead of UDM_MAXTEXTSIZE
===============================================================================

To further improve the "description" field quality, there are two additional
techniques you can use. 

First, you can define this value if you know it, by setting a description meta
tag in the head section.

Second, mnogosearch has an <index></noindex> tag pair that appears to make the
enclosed content completely invisible to the search engine.  I've used this on
the sites I maintain to 'vanish' the navigational elements, field names, and
other non-content type HTML and page window dressing so that only the important
content is indexed and reported on.

This last technique as an added (and more important benefit) of helping to
eliminate a lot of false matches in searches.
===============================================================================

The returned page description is only 100 characters long.

To store more information, you can change the appropriate database field length
to 255 characters (field "description" in the table "url"), and change the
following line in udm_common.h.

#define UDM_MAXTEXTSIZE 255

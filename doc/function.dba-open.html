dba_open — Open database

说明

resource dba_open ( string $path , string $mode [, string $handler [, mixed
$... ]] )

dba_open() establishes a database instance for path with mode using handler.

参数

path

    Commonly a regular path in your filesystem.

mode

    It is r for read access, w for read/write access to an already existing
    database, c for read/write access and database creation if it doesn't
    currently exist, and n for create, truncate and read/write access. The
    database is created in BTree mode, other modes (like Hash or Queue) are not
    supported.

    Additionally you can set the database lock method with the next char. Use l
    to lock the database with a .lck file or d to lock the databasefile itself.
    It is important that all of your applications do this consistently.

    If you want to test the access and do not want to wait for the lock you can
    add t as third character. When you are absolutely sure that you do not
    require database locking you can do so by using - instead of l or d. When
    none of d, l or - is used, dba will lock on the database file as it would
    with d.

        Note:

        There can only be one writer for one database file. When you use dba on
        a web server and more than one request requires write operations they
        can only be done one after another. Also read during write is not
        allowed. The dba extension uses locks to prevent this. See the
        following table:

                                  DBA locking
        already mode =  mode =  mode =  mode =  mode =  mode =  mode =  mode =
         open    "rl"    "rlt"   "wl"    "wlt"   "rd"    "rdt"   "wd"    "wdt"
        not     ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok      ok
        open
        mode =  ok      ok      wait    false   illegal illegal illegal illegal
        "rl"
        mode =  wait    false   wait    false   illegal illegal illegal illegal
        "wl"
        mode =  illegal illegal illegal illegal ok      ok      wait    false
        "rd"
        mode =  illegal illegal illegal illegal wait    false   wait    false
        "wd"

          ☆ ok: the second call will be successfull.
          ☆ wait: the second call waits until dba_close() is called for the
            first.
          ☆ false: the second call returns false.
          ☆ illegal: you must not mix "l" and "d" modifiers for mode parameter.

handler

    The name of the handler which shall be used for accessing path. It is
    passed all optional parameters given to dba_open() and can act on behalf of
    them.

返回值

Returns a positive handle on success 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      It's possible to open database files over network connection. However in
      cases a socket connection will be used (as with http or ftp) the
4.3.0 connection will be locked instead of the resource itself. This is
      important to know since in such cases locking is simply ignored on the
      resource and other solutions have to be found.

Here's a simple example to use the dba_open function

<?php

$id = dba_open("/tmp/test.db", "n", "gdbm");

if (!$id) {
        echo "dba_open failed\n";
        exit;
}

dba_replace("key", "This is an example!", $id);

if (dba_exists("key", $id)) {
        echo dba_fetch("key", $id);
        dba_delete("key", $id);
}

dba_close($id);
?>

As of GDBM version 1.8.3, GDBM's underlying open call uses non-blocking calls
to flock() on systems that have flock().  As a result, calls with "rd" or "wd"
locking modes will return error ("Can't be reader" or "Can't be writer")
instead of waiting.  Use "rl" or "wl" instead, to make PHP do its own locking
external to GDBM.

Windows does not support locking the database. You may use $_ENV to determine
the OS:

$locking = (stripos($_ENV['OS'],'windows') === false ? 'd' : 'l');

If you get some strange errors like
dba_open(): myDbFilename.db : Permission denied
than you are propably using PHP on a Windoze machine. You have to make sure
that the following conditions are met:

1) Use an absolute path to your db file. Relative paths will cause problems
with locking
2) Specify a locking mode - that's the second character of the mode-argument,
or else opening a dba-file will cause several notices/warnings etc.

And a final, general note:
3) Always use the english PHP doc on this site - the translations are often old
as hell and miss important informations

HTH, Nils.

Note the “c” create flag does not work if MySQL was built with the “cdb” DBA
handler compile option which is common for many distros.  By definition the cdb
DBA handler is optimized for reading/writing and “no updates are allowed.” 

<?php
$dbh = dba_open( "./data2/productz", "c", "cdb") or die( "Couldn't open
Database" );
?>

instead use

<?php
$dbh = dba_open( "./data2/productz", "n", "cdb" ) or die( "Couldnt open
Database" );
?>

generates this error message in the /var/log/apache2/error.log:
[Sun Sep 06 04:18:15 2009] [error] [client 192.168.1.125] PHP Warning: 
dba_open(./data2/productz,c) [<a href='function.dba-open'>function.dba-open</
a>]: Driver initialization failed for handler: cdb: Update operations are not
supported in /var/www/projects/testcdb-c.php on line 43

see user contributed comment under dba_handlers() to see which DBA handlers are
supported by your build of MySQL and note about using “cdb” compiled DBA
systems:

also see user contributed comment under dba_replace() about incompatibilities
with cdb DBA handler compiled MySQL systems.

Apache doesn't support Berkeley DB Btree, so you can't manipulate use db4 as
the type of database if you want to do DBM authentication with Apache.

gdbm seemed to work fine though, even though it supposedly using Btree instead
of hash.  It makes you wonder why Apache would use hash for one dbmtype versus
btree for another.

So since Apache and PHP don't have options to choose the method for the
Berkeley DBs, you are out of luck.

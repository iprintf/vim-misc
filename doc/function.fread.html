fread

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fread — 读取文件（可安全用于二进制文件）

说明

string fread ( resource $handle , int $length )

fread() 从文件指针 handle 读取最多 length 个字节。该函数在遇上以下几种情况时停
止读取文件：

  • 读取了 length 个字节
  • 到达了文件末尾（EOF）
  • a packet becomes available or the socket timeout occurs (for network
    streams)
  • if the stream is read buffered and it does not represent a plain file, at
    most one read of up to a number of bytes equal to the chunk size (usually
    8192) is made; depending on the previously buffered data, the size of the
    returned data may be larger than the chunk size.

参数

handle

    文件系统指针，是典型地由 fopen() 创建的 resource(资源)。

length

    最多读取 length 个字节。

返回值

返回所读取的字符串，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 一个简单的 fread() 例子

<?php
// get contents of a file into a string
$filename = "/usr/local/something.txt";
$handle = fopen($filename, "r");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);
?>

Example #2 Binary fread() example

Warning

在区分二进制文件和文本文件的系统上（如 Windows）打开文件时，fopen() 函数的 mode
参数要加上 'b'。

<?php
$filename = "c:\\files\\somepic.gif";
$handle = fopen($filename, "rb");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);
?>

Example #3 Remote fread() examples

Warning

当从任何不是普通本地文件读取时，例如在读取从远程文件或 popen() 以及 fsockopen()
返回的流时，读取会在一个包可用之后停止。这意味着应该如下例所示将数据收集起来合
并成大块。

<?php
// 对 PHP 5 及更高版本
$handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
$contents = stream_get_contents($handle);
fclose($handle);
?>
<?php
$handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
$contents = '';
while (!feof($handle)) {
  $contents .= fread($handle, 8192);
}
fclose($handle);
?>

注释

    Note:

    如果只是想将一个文件的内容读入到一个字符串中，用 file_get_contents()，它的
    性能比上面的代码好得多。

    Note:

    Note that fread() reads from the current position of the file pointer. Use 
    ftell() to find the current position of the pointer and rewind() to rewind
    the pointer position.

I had a fread script that hanged forever (from php manual):

<?php
$fp = fsockopen("example.host.com", 80);
if (!$fp) {
    echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
} else {
    fwrite($fp, "Data sent by socket");
    $content = "";
    while (!feof($fp)) {  //This looped forever
        $content .= fread($fp, 1024);
    }
    fclose($fp);
    echo $content;
}
?>

The problem is that sometimes end of streaming is not marked by EOF nor a fixed
mark, that's why this looped forever. This caused me a lot of headaches...
I solved it using the stream_get_meta_data function and a break statement as
the following shows:

<?php
$fp = fsockopen("example.host.com", 80);
if (!$fp) {
    echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
} else {
    fwrite($fp, "Data sent by socket");
    $content = "";
    while (!feof($fp)) { 
        $content .= fread($fp, 1024);
        $stream_meta_data = stream_get_meta_data($fp); //Added line
         if($stream_meta_data['unread_bytes'] <= 0) break; //Added line
    }
    fclose($fp);
    echo $content;
}
?>

Hope this will save a lot of headaches to someone.

I couldn't get some of the previous resume scripts to work with Free Download
Manager or Firefox.  I did some clean up and modified the code a little.

Changes:
1. Added a Flag to specify if you want download to be resumable or not
2. Some error checking and data cleanup for invalid/multiple ranges based on
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-http-range-retrieval-00.txt
3. Always calculate a $seek_end even though the range specification says it
could be empty... eg: bytes 500-/1234
4. Removed some Cache headers that didn't seem to be needed. (add back if you
have problems)
5. Only send partial content header if downloading a piece of the file (IE
workaround)

<?php

function dl_file_resumable($file, $is_resume=TRUE)
{
    //First, see if the file exists
    if (!is_file($file))
    {
        die("<b>404 File not found!</b>");
    }

    //Gather relevent info about file
    $size = filesize($file);
    $fileinfo = pathinfo($file);
   
    //workaround for IE filename bug with multiple periods / multiple dots in
filename
    //that adds square brackets to filename - eg. setup.abc.exe becomes setup
[1].abc.exe
    $filename = (strstr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE')) ?
                  preg_replace('/\./', '%2e', $fileinfo['basename'], 
substr_count($fileinfo['basename'], '.') - 1) :
                  $fileinfo['basename'];
   
    $file_extension = strtolower($path_info['extension']);

    //This will set the Content-Type to the appropriate setting for the file
    switch($file_extension)
    {
        case 'exe': $ctype='application/octet-stream'; break;
        case 'zip': $ctype='application/zip'; break;
        case 'mp3': $ctype='audio/mpeg'; break;
        case 'mpg': $ctype='video/mpeg'; break;
        case 'avi': $ctype='video/x-msvideo'; break;
        default:    $ctype='application/force-download';
    }

    //check if http_range is sent by browser (or download manager)
    if($is_resume && isset($_SERVER['HTTP_RANGE']))
    {
        list($size_unit, $range_orig) = explode('=', $_SERVER['HTTP_RANGE'], 2
);

        if ($size_unit == 'bytes')
        {
            //multiple ranges could be specified at the same time, but for
simplicity only serve the first range
            //http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-http-range-retrieval-00.txt
            list($range, $extra_ranges) = explode(',', $range_orig, 2);
        }
        else
        {
            $range = '';
        }
    }
    else
    {
        $range = '';
    }

    //figure out download piece from range (if set)
    list($seek_start, $seek_end) = explode('-', $range, 2);

    //set start and end based on range (if set), else set defaults
    //also check for invalid ranges.
    $seek_end = (empty($seek_end)) ? ($size - 1) : min(abs(intval($seek_end)),(
$size - 1));
    $seek_start = (empty($seek_start) || $seek_end < abs(intval($seek_start)))
? 0 : max(abs(intval($seek_start)),0);

    //add headers if resumable
    if ($is_resume)
    {
        //Only send partial content header if downloading a piece of the file
(IE workaround)
        if ($seek_start > 0 || $seek_end < ($size - 1))
        {
            header('HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content');
        }

        header('Accept-Ranges: bytes');
        header('Content-Range: bytes '.$seek_start.'-'.$seek_end.'/'.$size);
    }

    //headers for IE Bugs (is this necessary?)
    //header("Cache-Control: cache, must-revalidate");  
    //header("Pragma: public");

    header('Content-Type: ' . $ctype);
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"');
    header('Content-Length: '.($seek_end - $seek_start + 1));

    //open the file
    $fp = fopen($file, 'rb');
    //seek to start of missing part
    fseek($fp, $seek_start);

    //start buffered download
    while(!feof($fp))
    {
        //reset time limit for big files
        set_time_limit(0);
        print(fread($fp, 1024*8));
        flush();
        ob_flush();
    }

    fclose($fp);
    exit;
}

For anyone still trying to write an effective file downloader function/script,
the work has been done for you in all the major servers including Apache &
nginx.

Using the X-Sendfile header, you can do the following:

if ($user->isLoggedIn())
{
    header("X-Sendfile: $path_to_somefile_private");
    header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$somefile\"");
}

Apache will serve the file for you while NOT revealing your private file path!
Pretty nice. This works on all browsers/download managers and saves a lot of
resources.

Documentation:
Apache module: https://tn123.org/mod_xsendfile/
Nginx: http://wiki.nginx.org/XSendfile
Lighttpd: http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/02/x-sendfile/

Hopefully this will save you many hours of work.

This is an hack I've done to download remote files with HTTP resume support.
This is useful if you want to write a download script that fetches files
remotely and then sends them to the user, adding support to download managers
(I tested it on wget). To do that you should also use a "remote_filesize"
function that you can easily write/find.

<?php
function readfile_chunked_remote($filename, $seek = 0, $retbytes = true, 
$timeout = 3) {
    set_time_limit(0);
    $defaultchunksize = 1024*1024;
    $chunksize = $defaultchunksize;
    $buffer = '';
    $cnt = 0;
    $remotereadfile = false;

    if (preg_match('/[a-zA-Z]+:\/\//', $filename))
        $remotereadfile = true;

    $handle = @fopen($filename, 'rb');

    if ($handle === false) {
        return false;
    }

    stream_set_timeout($handle, $timeout);
   
    if ($seek != 0 && !$remotereadfile)
        fseek($handle, $seek);

    while (!feof($handle)) {

        if ($remotereadfile && $seek != 0 && $cnt+$chunksize > $seek)
            $chunksize = $seek-$cnt;
        else
            $chunksize = $defaultchunksize;

        $buffer = @fread($handle, $chunksize);

        if ($retbytes || ($remotereadfile && $seek != 0)) {
            $cnt += strlen($buffer);
        }

        if (!$remotereadfile || ($remotereadfile && $cnt > $seek))
            echo $buffer;

        ob_flush();
        flush();
    }

    $info = stream_get_meta_data($handle);

    $status = fclose($handle);

    if ($info['timed_out'])
        return false;

    if ($retbytes && $status) {
        return $cnt;
    }

    return $status;
}

I was trying to implement resume support in download script, and i have finnaly
succeded. here is the script:

<?php
function dl_file_resume($file){

   //First, see if the file exists
   if (!is_file($file)) { die("<b>404 File not found!</b>"); }

   //Gather relevent info about file
   $len = filesize($file);
   $filename = basename($file);
   $file_extension = strtolower(substr(strrchr($filename,"."),1));

   //This will set the Content-Type to the appropriate setting for the file
   switch( $file_extension ) {
     case "exe": $ctype="application/octet-stream"; break;
     case "zip": $ctype="application/zip"; break;
     case "mp3": $ctype="audio/mpeg"; break;
     case "mpg":$ctype="video/mpeg"; break;
     case "avi": $ctype="video/x-msvideo"; break;

     //The following are for extensions that shouldn't be downloaded (sensitive
stuff, like php files)
     case "php":
     case "htm":
     case "html":
     case "txt": die("<b>Cannot be used for ". $file_extension ." files!</b>");
break;

     default: $ctype="application/force-download";
   }

   //Begin writing headers
   header("Pragma: public");
   header("Expires: 0");
   header("Cache-Control:");
   header("Cache-Control: public");
   header("Content-Description: File Transfer");
  
   //Use the switch-generated Content-Type
   header("Content-Type: $ctype");
$filespaces = str_replace("_", " ", $filename);

//if your filename contains underscores, you can replace them with spaces
  $header='Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.$filespaces.';';
   header($header );
   header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");

  $size=filesize($file);
//check if http_range is sent by browser (or download manager)
   if(isset($_ENV['HTTP_RANGE'])) {
list($a, $range)=explode("=",$_ENV['HTTP_RANGE']);
//if yes, download missing part
str_replace($range, "-", $range);
$size2=$size-1;
header("Content-Range: $range$size2/$size");
$new_length=$size2-$range;
header("Content-Length: $new_length");
/if not, download whole file
} else {
$size2=$size-1;
header("Content-Range: bytes 0-$size2/$size");
header("Content-Length: ".$size2);
}
//open the file
$fp=fopen("$file","r");
//seek to start of missing part
fseek($fp,$range);
//start buffered download
while(!feof($fp))
{
//reset time limit for big files
set_time_limit();
print(fread($fp,1024*8));
flush();
}
fclose($fp);
  
   exit;
    
}
?>

EXAMPLE
<?php
dl_file_resume("somefile.mp3");
?>

please write if you find any errors, i have tested this only with mp3 files,
but others should be fine
===============================================================================

If, like me, you're in the habit of using fopen("http://...") and fread for
pulling fairly large remote files, you may find that the upgrade to PHP5 (5.0.2
on Win2000/IIS5) causes fread to top out at about 8035 bytes. PHP5 RC2 with
identical php.ini settings did not exhibit this behaviour (I was using this for
testing). Irritating for me because I was using simple_xml_load to load the
file contents as XML, and the problem initially appeared to be that function.

Solution - swap over to file_get_contents or use the loop suggested on the
documentation above (see Warning).
===============================================================================

Concerning [problems with UTF-8 and] downloading Zip files I found that simply
adding 3 lines of code before starting the fread to the buffer for delivery in
all browsers solved the problem.

<?php
    ob_end_clean();
    ob_start();
    header( 'Content-Type:' );
?>

... see where placed in the function below:

<?php
function readfile_chunked( $filename, $retbytes = true ) {
    $chunksize = 1 * (1024 * 1024); // how many bytes per chunk
    $buffer = '';
    $cnt = 0;
    $handle = fopen( $filename, 'rb' );
    if ( $handle === false ) {
        return false;
    }
    ob_end_clean(); //added to fix ZIP file corruption
    ob_start(); //added to fix ZIP file corruption
    header( 'Content-Type:' ); //added to fix ZIP file corruption
    while ( !feof( $handle ) ) {
        $buffer = fread( $handle, $chunksize );
        //$buffer = str_replace("ï»¿","",$buffer);
        echo $buffer;
        ob_flush();
        flush();
        if ( $retbytes ) {
            $cnt += strlen( $buffer );
        }
    }
    $status = fclose( $handle );
    if ( $retbytes && $status ) {
        return $cnt; // return num. bytes delivered like readfile() does.
    }
    return $status;
}
?>
===============================================================================

The following function retrieves a line in a file, regardless of its size, so
you won't get an error if the file's size is beyond php's allowed memory limit
(the string has to be below however), which is something i was needing for
accessing a big log file generated by a webhost. Indexes start at 1 (so $line =
1 means the first line unlike arrays). If the file is small, it would be better
to use "file()" however.

<?php
function strpos_count($haystack, $needle, $i = 0) {
    while (strpos($haystack,$needle) !== false) {$haystack = substr($haystack,
(strpos($haystack,$needle) + 1)); $i++;}
    return $i;
}
function getLine($file,$line=1){
    $occurence = 0;
    $contents = '';
    $startPos = -1;
    if (!file_exists($file)) return '';
    $fp = @fopen($file, "rb");
    if (!$fp) return '';
    while (!@feof($fp)) {
        $str = @fread($fp, 1024);
        $number_of_occurences = strpos_count($str,"\n");
        if ($number_of_occurences == 0) {if ($start_pos != -1) {$contents .= 
$str;}}
        else {
            $lastPos = 0;
            for ($i = 0; $i < $number_of_occurences; $i++){
                $pos = strpos($str,"\n", $lastPos);
                $occurence++;
                if ($occurence == $line) {
                    $startPos = $pos;
                    if ($i == $number_of_occurences - 1) {$contents = substr(
$str, $startPos + 1);}
                } elseif ($occurence == $line + 1) {
                    if ($i == 0) {$contents .= substr($str, 0, $pos);} else {
$contents = substr($str, $startPos, $pos - $startPos);}
                    $occurence = 0;
                    break;
                }
                $lastPos = $pos + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    @fclose($fp);
    return $contents;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Here's a function for sending a file to the client - it may look more
complicated than necessary, but has a number of advantages over simpler file
sending functions:

- Works with large files, and uses only an 8KB buffer per transfer.

- Stops transferring if the client is disconnected (unlike many scripts, that
continue to read and buffer the entire file, wasting valuable resources) but
does not halt the script

- Returns TRUE if transfer was completed, or FALSE if the client was
disconnected before completing the download - you'll often need this, so you
can log downloads correctly.

- Sends a number of headers, including ones that ensure it's cached for a
maximum of 2 hours on any browser/proxy, and "Content-Length" which most people
seem to forget.

(tested on Linux (Apache) and Windows (IIS5/6) under PHP4.3.x)

Note that the folder from which protected files will be pulled, is set as a
constant in this function (/protected) ... Now here's the function:

<?php
function send_file($name) {
  ob_end_clean();
  $path = "protected/".$name;
  if (!is_file($path) or connection_status()!=0) return(FALSE);
  header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
  header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
  header("Pragma: no-cache");
  header("Expires: ".gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", mktime(date("H")+2, date("i"), 
date("s"), date("m"), date("d"), date("Y")))." GMT");
  header("Last-Modified: ".gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s")." GMT");
  header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
  header("Content-Length: ".(string)(filesize($path)));
  header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=$name");
  header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n");
  if ($file = fopen($path, 'rb')) {
    while(!feof($file) and (connection_status()==0)) {
      print(fread($file, 1024*8));
      flush();
    }
    fclose($file);
  }
  return((connection_status()==0) and !connection_aborted());
}
?>

And here's an example of using the function:

<?php
if (!send_file("platinumdemo.zip")) {
die ("file transfer failed");
// either the file transfer was incomplete
// or the file was not found
} else {
// the download was a success
// log, or do whatever else
}
?>

===============================================================================

If you serve a file download over PHP with fread and print/echo and experience
corrupted binary files, chances are the server still uses magic quotes and
escapes the null bytes in your file. Although from 5.3.0 magic quotes are no
longer supported, you might still encounter this problem. Try to turn them off
by placing this code before using fread:

<?php
@ini_set('magic_quotes_runtime', 0);
?>
===============================================================================

Note that fread() returns an empty string if you try to read beyond EOF, while
the manual states otherwise ("Returns [...] FALSE on failure."). This e. g.
happens with empty files (0 bytes long).

This does not look like a bug in PHP's fread() implementation to me, but rather
like a documentation bug. The manpage for the C function fread() states:
> fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must
use feof(3) and ferror(3) to determine which occurred.
It also says:
> If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return value is a
short item count (or zero).

That means that in the case of empty files, C's fread() returns 0 and thus we
get an empty PHP string: PHP's fread() does not seem to check for errors as the
manpage recommends; that's fine, the PHP programmer has to do it, but it would
be nice if this behaviour would be explicitly documented.

In short: When using fread(), you have to check for FALSE and empty strings.
Consider the following wrapper function:
<?php
function my_fread( $handle, $length )
{
  if( ( $ret = fread( $handle, $length ) ) === '' )
  {
    return false;
  }

  return $ret;
}
?>
===============================================================================

reading from a socket stream can be different to the
behaviour expected, since you have not set
stream_set_blocking to 1.
sample source:
<?php
$fp = fsockopen ($server, $port, $errno, $errstr, $socket_timeout);
$header = '';
do {
    $header.=fread($fp,1);
    $i++;
} while (!preg_match('/\\r\\n\\r\\n$/', $header) && $i < $maxheaderlenth);
preg_match('/Content\\-Length:\\s+([0-9]*)\\r\\n/', $header,$matches);
$buffer = fread($this->_fp, $matches[1]);
?>

if i.e. the content length is 50000 and the responding server is to slow
(means 50000 are not completely sent when fread is called)
you'll only receive the number of bytes sent by the
responding server at the time fread is called.

fread will not wait for any data to complete the given size.
as described in user notes on stream_set_blocking there
seems to be a bug using stream_set_blocking.
a workaround - well, not the best way - is to read
the response split to 1 byte
instead of
<?php $buffer = fread($this->_fp, $matches[1]); ?>

you'd write
<?php
$buffer = '';
for($i = 0; $i < $matches[1]; $i++){
    $buffer .= fread($this->_fp, 1);
}
?>

it several tests this seems like it works.
===============================================================================

Changing the value of $length may yield to different download speeds when
serving a file from a script.

I was not able to max out my 10mbps connection when 4096 was used. I found out
that using 16384 would use all the available bandwidth.

When outputing binary data with fread, do not assume that 4096 or 8192 is the
optimal value for you. Do some benchmarks by downloading files through your
script.

To make the effects of the latest PHP version changes of the fread function
even more explicit:  the new size limitation of fread -regardless of the
filesize one specifies,  in the example below 1024 * 1024- means that if one
was  simply reading the contents of a text file from a dynamic URL like so:

<?php
  $dp = "http://www.example.com/filename.php";
  $buffer = fopen($dp, 'r');
  if (!$buffer)
    {
      echo("<P>Error: unable to load URL file into $buffer.      Process 
aborted.</P>");
      exit();
    }
  $sp = fread($buffer, 1024*1024);
  fclose($buffer);
  highlight_string($sp);
?>

one should from now on use the file_get_contents function, as shown below, to
avoid one's text being truncated forcibly.

<?php
  $dp = "http://www.example.com/filename.php";
  if (!$dp)
    {
      echo("<P>Error: unable to load URL file into $dp.  Process aborted.</P>"
);
      exit();
    }
  $sp = file_get_contents($dp);
  highlight_string($sp);
?>

I thought it couldn't hurt to clarify this detail in order to save time for
anyone else who is in the same situation as I was tonight when my ISP abruptly
upgraded to the latest version of PHP...    :(

Thank you to every previous contributor to this topic.

If you read from a socket connection or any other stream that may delay when
responsing but you want to set a timeout you can use stream_set_timeout():

<?php
$f = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 123);
if ($f)
{
  fwrite($f, "hello");
  stream_set_timeout($f, 5); //5 seconds read timeout
  if (!fread($f, 5)) echo "Error while reading";
    else echo "Read ok";
  fclose($f);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Note to IIS admins:

When using PHP via the FastCGI ISAPI extension, there is a script timeout of
approximately 1hr that cannot be adjusted. When using PHP via CGI, there is a
script timeout that is based upon the value of the CGITimeout configuration
option. This value must be set extremely high if you plan to serve large files.
An explanation of how to configure this option can be found here: http://
www.iisadmin.co.uk/?p=7 If you do not modify this setting you can expect the
above scripts to fail silently once it has hit the default value (30 minutes in
my case).
===============================================================================

It might be worth noting that if your site uses a front controller with
sessions and you send a large file to a user; you should end the session just
before sending the file, otherwise the user will not be able to continue
continue browsing the site while the file is downloading.
===============================================================================

Note that fread() will return '' (empty string) when a timeout occurs unlike
socket_read() which returns false...
===============================================================================

My script was based on example 3b, but used up 100% CPU when a timeout occurred
that wasn't "seen". This is very bad. So here's my code, hoping this will help
people out there with the same problem. Obviously first use $rPage = fsockopen
(...) and fwrite($rPage,...) and such, after which:

    $sPage    = ''; // the page goes in here
    $iTimeout    = 5; // set the timeout in seconds
    stream_set_timeout($rPage,$iTimeout);
    stream_set_blocking($rPage,0);
    $fTimeout    = microtime(true);
    do {
        if (($sRead = fread($rPage,8192))!==false and strlen($sRead)) {
            $sPage    .= $sRead; }
        else {
            usleep(10000); } // 0.01 second
        $aInfo    = stream_get_meta_data($rPage); }
    while (!feof($rPage) and !$aInfo['timed_out'] and microtime(true)-$fTimeout
<$iTimeout);
    fclose($rPage);
    // now simply decompress and unchunk $sPage, if need be

Above code will make sure the timeout is used, because this isn't always
detected properly. In addition, the usleep() will keep the CPU in check.
===============================================================================

I thought I had an issue where fread() would fail on files > 30M in size. I
tried a file_get_contents() method with the same results. The issue was not
reading the file, but echoing its data back to the browser.

Basically, you need to split up the filedata into manageable chunks before
firing it off to the browser:

<?php

$total     = filesize($filepath);
$blocksize = (2 << 20); //2M chunks
$sent      = 0;
$handle    = fopen($filepath, "r");

// Push headers that tell what kind of file is coming down the pike
header('Content-type: '.$content_type);
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.$filename);
header('Content-length: '.$filesize * 1024);
               
// Now we need to loop through the file and echo out chunks of file data
// Dumping the whole file fails at > 30M!
while($sent < $total){
    echo fread($handle, $blocksize);
    $sent += $blocksize;
}
           
exit(0);

?>

Hope this helps someone!

Simple userlist script that reads content from a file and prints it back.

<?php

    $file = "users.txt";
    $handle = fopen($file, "a+");
   
   
   
    if(!filesize($file)>0) {
        echo "File is empty!";
    }

        echoUsers();
    }
   
    fclose($handle);
   
    function echoUsers() {
        global $fcontent;
        $users = explode(" ", $fcontent);
       
        foreach($users as $user) {
            echo $user."<br />";
        }
    }

===============================================================================

Somehow all code samples for downloads, described here, doesn't work right for
me.
When I download a big file readfile or fread in b mode, the final file hasn't
the same md5 like the originial.

Some tests helps me, finding a solution:

<?php
            $fp = fopen($DownloadFile, 'rb');
            while ( $cline = fgets($fp) )
            {
                print $cline;
            }
            fclose($fp);
?>

Somehow, it's "binary safe" and deliver that file which are read. md5 original
and download are the same.
===============================================================================

Various scripts suggested here attempt to deliver a file for download to a
client. Handling http protocol features such as HTTP_RANGE is not trivial;
neither is handling flow control with the server, memory and time limits when
the files are large.

An alternative is to let the web server can handle http by redirecting to the
file in question. It's not uncommon e.g. http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/
does this.

A PHP script can do any checks needed (security, authentication, validate the
file) and any other tasks before calling header("Location $urltofile");

I tested this with apache. Interrupt/resume download works. The server's mime
type configuration will determine client behavior. For apache, if defaults in
mime.types are not suitable, configuration directives for mod_mime could go in
a .htaccess file in the directory of the file to download. If really necessary,
these could even by written by the PHP script before it redirects.
===============================================================================

This code is buggy
<?php
$contents = '';
while (!feof($handle)) {
  $contents .= fread($handle, 8192);
}
?>
When you read a file whose size is a multiple of the readsize (8192 here), then
the loop is executed when there are no more data to read. Here, the result of
fread() is not checked, and so the instruction
<?php
$contents .= fread($handle, 8192)
?>
is executed once with no data from fread(). In this very case, it is not
important, but in some situation it could be harmful.

The good way to read a file block by block is :
<?php
while ( ($buf=fread( $handle, 8192 )) != '' ) {
    // Here, $buf is guaranted to contain data
    $contents .= $buf;
}
if($buf===FALSE) {
    echo "THERE WAS AN ERROR READING\n";
}
?>
===============================================================================

I write this script for download with resume suport
<?php
// If user click the download link
if(isset($_GET['filename'])){
        // The directory of downloadable files
        // This directory should be unaccessible from web
        $file_dir="/tmp/";

        // Replace the slash and backslash character with empty string
        // The slash and backslash character can be dangerous
        $file_name=str_replace("/", "", $_GET['filename']);
        $file_name=str_replace("\\", "", $file_name);

        // If the requested file is exist
        if(file_exists($file_dir.$file_name)){
                // Get the file size
                $file_size=filesize($file_dir.$file_name);
                // Open the file
                $fh=fopen($file_dir.$file_name, "r");

                // Download speed in KB/s
                $speed=5;

                // Initialize the range of bytes to be transferred
                $start=0;
                $end=$file_size-1;

                        preg_match('/^bytes=(\d+)-(\d*)/', $_SERVER[
'HTTP_RANGE'], $arr)){

                        // Starting byte
                        $start=$arr[1];
                        if($arr[2]){
                                // Ending byte
                                $end=$arr[2];
                        }
                }

                // Check if starting and ending byte is valid

                        header("HTTP/1.1 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable");
                        header("Content-Length: 0");
                }
                else{
                        // For the first time download
                        if($start==0 && $end==$file_size){
                                // Send HTTP OK header
                                header("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
                        }
                        else{
                                // For resume download

                                header("Content-Range: bytes ".$start."-".$end.
"/".$file_size);
                        }

                        // Bytes left

If you use any of the above code for downloadinng files, Internet Explorer will
change the filename if it has multiple periods in it to something with square
brackets.  To work around this, we check to see if the User Agent contains MSIE
and rewrite the necessary periods as %2E

<?php
# eg. $filename="setup.abc.exe";
if (strstr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], "MSIE")) {
    # workaround for IE filename bug with multiple periods / multiple dots in
filename
    # that adds square brackets to filename - eg. setup.abc.exe becomes setup
[1].abc.exe
    $iefilename = preg_replace('/\./', '%2e', $filename, substr_count($filename
, '.') - 1);
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$iefilename" );
} else {
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$filename");
}
?>
===============================================================================

Several of these examples use a Content-Disposition header to force the browser
to save a file but then they specify the file name without quotes. This will
cause problems for some browsers (Mozilla Fire Fox) if the file name contains a
space.  You must put quotes around the name if you want to work reliably for
all files in all browsers.
<?php
header ("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$theFileName"); // bad

header ("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$theFileName\""); // good

?>
===============================================================================

For download the big files (more than 8MB), you must used ob_flush() because
the function flush empty the Apache memory and not PHP memory.
And the max size of PHP memory is 8MB, but ob_flush is able to empty the PHP
memory.

<?php
header('Content-Type: application/force-download');
header ("Content-Length: " . filesize($file));
header ("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$theFileName");

   $fd = fopen($file, "r");
   while(!feof($fd))
  {
       echo fread($fd, 4096);
       ob_flush();
      
   }
?>
===============================================================================

Just a note for anybody trying to implement a php handled download script -

We spent a long time trying to figure out why our code was eating system
resources on large files.. Eventually we managed to trace it to output
buffering that was being started on every page via an include.. (It was
attempting to buffer the entire 600 Megs or whatever size *before* sending data
to the client) if you have this problem you may want to check that first and
either not start buffering or close that in the usual way :)

Hope that prevents somebody spending hours trying to fix an obscure issue.

Regards :)
===============================================================================

After using the suggested function from Rasmus Schultz : mindplay(at)mindplay
(dot)dk, I've just noticed that people trying to download big files with a slow
connection would get download stopped after exactly 60seconds -> the max
execution time set with php.ini.
I suggest using a bigger buffer (1024x1024), or maybe resetting the time limit
within the 'while' cicle with:
   set_time_limit(0);

The cicle would go like this:

<?php
   while(!feof($file) and (connection_status()==0)) {
     print(fread($file, 1024*1024));
     set_time_limit(0);
     flush();
   }
?>

fread also works for fsockopen's that are open-ended (no feof) if you know how
the last packet for a particular set of data should end. For example, if you
sent a command to an nntp server, the reply from the server would end with a
dot and a carriage return/linefeed. The connection still stays open for more
commands, but doing it this way is more efficient than doing line-by-line fgets
until you get to the end of the reply.

<?php
if(($res=nntp_cmd($conn,"BODY $msgid",222))===false){
    continue;
}else{
    $contents='';
    while(1){
        $packet=fread($conn,8192);
        $contents.=$packet;
        if(substr($packet,-3)==".\r\n")break;
    }
    // do something with $contents
}
?>
===============================================================================

Two quick notes on download prompting...
First, the following line:

<?php
header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
?>

causes IE6 to prompt you to download the script instead of the output and will
fail to connect.  Take out that header and everything works perfectly.

Pragma: no-cache doesn't cause a problem.

Second, Mozilla tries to add .php to the download file name if content-type is
application. Changing the content type to the more specific MIME type (such as
audio/mpeg) fixes that but causes IE to try its plugins (such as Quicktime).

The fix I found for that to specify attachment instead of inline.  Here's my
code: a prompted, small buffer MP3 download:

<?php
function downloadMP3 ($fileDir, $fileName) {
   $completeFilePath=$fileDir.'/'.$fileName;
   header('Pragma: no-cache');
   header("Content-type: audio/mpeg\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=
\"" . $fileName . "\"\nContent-length: ".(string)(filesize($completeFilePath
)));
   $fd=fopen($completeFilePath,'rb');
      while(!feof($fd)) {
         print(fread($fd, 4096));
         flush();
      }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Tom, the idea for the examples below is to ensure the user has proper
credentials before serving the file. With that security in mind, the suggestion
of a 302 redirection seems like a risky idea. Anyone with a modicum of
networking experience can run a TCP trace and see the 302 Redirect response, as
it is actually a response received by the client browser; the browser then
makes a subsequent http request for the URL provided in the Location header. 
When that 302 response is captured by wireshark, the 'secret' location is then
exposed and can be shared with anyone who wishes to bypass the authorization
routines in the php.

The only way to secure this would be for the 302 Redirection response to
include some kind of unique, per-request, expiring authorization token, either
on the end of the url or in a set-cookie, that is then checked by an
authorization module implemented within the hosting webserver. Otherwise,
you're relegated to the methods described below.
===============================================================================

I spent a while trying to get this to work so I thought I'd share.

Here's how to read a remote binary file using fread.

<?php
$fp = fopen("http://www.example.com/img.jpg", "rb");

if($fp){
while(!feof($fp)) {
     $img = $img . fread($fp, 1024);
}
}
?>

This will read the contents of the file into the var $img 1024 bytes at a
time.  I used that number because it seemed safe, but you can increment it all
you want I guess.

I don't know if everyone but me gets this, but I thought I'd share since I
didn't see anything like it out there.
===============================================================================

Fread is binary-safe IF AND ONLY IF you don't use magic-quotes. If you do, all
null bytes will become \0, and you might get surprising results when unpacking.

That is, you would do something like

<?php
set_magic_quotes_runtime(0);
?>

before fread()

and something like

<?php
set_magic_quotes_runtime(get_magic_quotes_gpc()) after.
?>

And, after fread, an unpack would be needed, of course. Surprisingly, pack(),
however, does not work quite like in Perl (or perhaps I'm just missing
something here) - you can't pack an array directly, but instead you'll have to
pack each element seperately to the string:

<?php
foreach ($data as $dec) {
  $data_output .= pack("C*", $dec);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Having tried to reliably transfer large amounts of binary data over a latent
network, I found out that fread()/fwrite() should never be trusted to read/
write the whole block with the exact length specified, even in blocking mode,
even for small block lengths.

I came up with these two functions, fully-replaceable and reliable alternatives
of fread()/fwrite() in a socket context:

<?php

function fullwrite ($sd, $buf) {
  $total = 0;
  $len = strlen($buf);

  while ($total < $len && ($written = fwrite($sd, $buf))) {
    $total += $written;
    $buf = substr($buf, $written);
  }

  return $total;
}

function fullread ($sd, $len) {
  $ret = '';
  $read = 0;

  while ($read < $len && ($buf = fread($sd, $len - $read))) {
    $read += strlen($buf);
    $ret .= $buf;
  }

  return $ret;
}

?>

The functions are "greedy", i.e. trying to read/write as much data as possible
at once. If the call to fread()/fwrite() reads/writes less than expected, then
the next iteration eats up the remainder. Very smart as only the largest
possible chunks are read/written.

Only in case of a broken pipe fullread()/fullwrite() return less than the
specified length. Otherwise it is guaranteed that upon termination

strlen(fullread($sd, $len)) == $len

and

fullwrite($sd, $buf) == strlen($buf)

Works perfectly with a socket descriptor returned from stream_socket_client()
or fsockopen().

I tried to use the download resume script below, but it put extreme load on the
server for just 1 download only (the file is around 200MB).

Be carefull when you test the script on your server. I'll fgets, or other

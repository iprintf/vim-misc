MongoCollection::createIndex

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoCollection::createIndex — Creates an index on the specified field(s) if it
does not already exist.

说明

public bool MongoCollection::createIndex ( array $keys [, array $options =
array() ] )

Creates an index on the specified field(s) if it does not already exist. Fields
may be indexed with a direction (e.g. ascending or descending) or a special
type (e.g. text, geospatial, hashed).

    Note:

    This method will use the » createIndexes database command when
    communicating with MongoDB 2.6+. For previous database versions, the method
    will perform an insert operation on the special system.indexes collection.

参数

keys

    An array specifying the index's fields as its keys. For each field, the
    value is either the index direction or » index type. If specifying
    direction, specify 1 for ascending or -1 for descending.

options

    An array of options for the index creation. We pass all given options
    straight to the server, but a non-exhaustive list of currently available
    options include:
      □ "unique"

        Specify TRUE to create a unique index. The default value is FALSE. This
        option applies only to ascending/descending indexes.

            Note:

            When MongoDB indexes a field, if a document does not have a value
            for the field, a NULL value is indexed. If multiple documents do
            not contain a field, a unique index will reject all but the first
            of those documents. The "sparse" option may be used to overcome
            this, since it will prevent documents without the field from being
            indexed.

      □ "sparse"

        Specify TRUE to create a sparse index, which only indexes documents
        containing a specified field. The default value is FALSE.

      □ "expireAfterSeconds"

        The value of this option should specify the number of seconds after
        which a document should be considered expired and automatically removed
        from the collection. This option is only compatible with single-field
        indexes where the field will contain MongoDate values.

            Note:

            This feature is available in MongoDB 2.2+. See » Expire Data from
            Collections by Setting TTL for more information.

      □ "name"

        A optional name that uniquely identifies the index.

            Note:

            By default, the driver will generate an index name based on the
            index's field(s) and ordering or type. For example, a compound
            index array("x" => 1, "y" => -1) would be named "x_1_y_-1" and a
            geospatial index array("loc" => "2dsphere") would be named
            "loc_2dsphere". For indexes with many fields, it is possible that
            the generated name might exceed MongoDB's » limit for index names.
            The "name" option may be used in that case to supply a shorter
            name.

      □ "background"

        Builds the index in the background so that building an index does not
        block other database activities. Specify TRUE to build in the
        background. The default value is FALSE.

        Warning

        Prior to MongoDB 2.6.0, index builds on secondaries were executed as
        foreground operations, irrespective of this option. See » Building
        Indexes with Replica Sets for more information.

      □ "socketTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for socket
        communication. If the server does not respond within the timeout
        period, a MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown and there will be
        no way to determine if the server actually handled the write or not. A
        value of -1 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 30000 (30 seconds).

    The following option may be used with MongoDB 2.6+:
      □ "maxTimeMS"

        Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing the
        operation on the server (does not include idle time). If the operation
        is not completed by the server within the timeout period, a
        MongoExecutionTimeoutException will be thrown.

    The following options may be used with MongoDB versions before 2.8:
      □ "dropDups"

        Specify TRUE to force creation of a unique index where the collection
        may contain duplicate values for a key. MongoDB will index the first
        occurrence of a key and delete all subsequent documents from the
        collection that contain a duplicate value for that key. The default
        value is FALSE.

        Warning

        "dropDups" may delete data from your database. Use with extreme
        caution.

            Note:

            This option is not supported on MongoDB 2.8+. Index creation will
            fail if the collection contains duplicate values.

    The following options may be used with MongoDB versions before 2.6:
      □ "w"

        See WriteConcerns. The default value for MongoClient is 1.

      □ "wTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for write
        concern acknowledgement. It is only applicable when "w" is greater than
        1, as the timeout pertains to replication. If the write concern is not
        satisfied within the time limit, a MongoCursorException will be thrown.
        A value of 0 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 10000 (ten seconds).

    The following options are deprecated and should no longer be used:
      □ "safe"

        Deprecated. Please use the WriteConcern w option.

      □ "timeout"

        Integer, defaults to MongoCursor::$timeout. If "safe" is set, this sets
        how long (in milliseconds) for the client to wait for a database
        response. If the database does not respond within the timeout period, a
        MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown.

      □ "wtimeout"

        Deprecated alias for "wTimeoutMS".

返回值

Returns an array containing the status of the index creation. The array
contains whether the operation succeeded ("ok"), the number of indexes before
and after the operation ("numIndexesBefore" and "numIndexesAfter"), and whether
the collection that the index belongs to has been created (
"createdCollectionAutomatically"). If the index already existed and did not
need to be created, a "note" field may be present in lieu of "numIndexesAfter".

With MongoDB 2.4 and earlier, a status document is only returned if the write
concern is at least 1. Otherwise, TRUE is returned. The fields in the status
document are different, except for the "ok" field, which signals whether the
index creation was successful. Additional fields are described in the
documentation for MongoCollection::insert().

错误／异常

Throws MongoException if the index name is longer than 128 bytes, or if the
index specification is not an array.

Throws MongoDuplicateKeyException if the server could not create the unique
index due to conflicting documents.

Throws MongoResultException if the server could not create the index due to an
error.

Throws MongoCursorException if the "w" option is set and the write fails.

Throws MongoCursorTimeoutException if the "w" option is set to a value greater
than one and the operation takes longer than MongoCursor::$timeout milliseconds
to complete. This does not kill the operation on the server, it is a
client-side timeout. The operation in MongoCollection::$wtimeout is
milliseconds.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::createIndex() example

<?php

$c = new MongoCollection($db, 'foo');

// create an index on 'x' ascending
$c->createIndex(array('x' => 1));

// create a unique index on 'y'
$c->createIndex(array('y' => 1), array('unique' => true));

// create a compound index on 'za' ascending and 'zb' descending
$c->createIndex(array('za' => 1, 'zb' => -1));

?>

Example #2 Geospatial Indexing

Mongo supports geospatial indexes, which allow you to search for documents near
a given location or within a shape. The following example creates a geospatial
index on the "loc" field:

<?php

$collection->createIndex(array('loc' => '2dsphere'));

?>

Example #3 Drop duplicates example

<?php

$collection->insert(array('username' => 'joeschmoe'));
$collection->insert(array('username' => 'joeschmoe'));

/* Index creation fails, since you cannot create a unique index on a field when
 * duplicates exist.
 */
$collection->createIndex(array('username' => 1), array('unique' => 1));

/* MongoDB will one of the conflicting documents and allow the unique index to
 * be created.
 */
$collection->createIndex(array('username' => 1), array('unique' => 1, 
'dropDups' => 1));

/
* We now have a unique index and subsequent inserts with the same username will
 * fail.
 */
$collection->insert(array('username' => 'joeschmoe'));

?>

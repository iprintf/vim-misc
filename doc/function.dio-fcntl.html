dio_fcntl — Performs a c library fcntl on fd

说明

mixed dio_fcntl ( resource $fd , int $cmd [, mixed $args ] )

The dio_fcntl() function performs the operation specified by cmd on the file
descriptor fd. Some commands require additional arguments args to be supplied.

参数

fd

    The file descriptor returned by dio_open().

cmd

    Can be one of the following operations:
      □ F_SETLK - Lock is set or cleared. If the lock is held by someone else 
        dio_fcntl() returns -1.

      □ F_SETLKW - like F_SETLK, but in case the lock is held by someone else, 
        dio_fcntl() waits until the lock is released.

      □ F_GETLK - dio_fcntl() returns an associative array (as described above)
        if someone else prevents lock. If there is no obstruction key "type"
        will set to F_UNLCK.

      □ F_DUPFD - finds the lowest numbered available file descriptor greater
        than or equal to args and returns them.

      □ F_SETFL - Sets the file descriptors flags to the value specified by
        args, which can be O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK or O_ASYNC. To use O_ASYNC you
        will need to use the PCNTL extension.

args

    args is an associative array, when cmd is F_SETLK or F_SETLLW, with the
    following keys:
      □ start - offset where lock begins

      □ length - size of locked area. zero means to end of file

      □ whence - Where l_start is relative to: can be SEEK_SET, SEEK_END and
        SEEK_CUR

      □ type - type of lock: can be F_RDLCK (read lock), F_WRLCK (write lock)
        or F_UNLCK (unlock)

返回值

Returns the result of the C call.

范例

Example #1 Setting and clearing a lock

<?php

$fd = dio_open('/dev/ttyS0', O_RDWR);

if (dio_fcntl($fd, F_SETLK, Array("type"=>F_WRLCK)) == -1) {
   // the file descriptor appears locked
   echo "The lock can not be cleared. It is held by someone else.";
} else {
   echo "Lock successfully set/cleared";
}

dio_close($fd);
?>

===============================================================================

Actually, there's a small typo in the above docs. The parameter for where
l_start is relative to is actually "whence" and not "wenth" like stated.

Here is a simple way to control who downloads your files...

You will have to set: $filename, $downloaddir, $safedir and $downloadURL.

Basically $filename is the name of a file, $downloaddir is any dir on your
server, $safedir is a dir that is not accessible by a browser that contains a
file named $filename and $downloadURL is the URL equivalent of your
$downloaddir.

The way this works is when a user wants to download a file, a randomly named
dir is created in the $downloaddir, and a symbolic link is created to the file
being requested.  The browser is then redirected to the new link and the
download begins.

The code also deletes any past symbolic links created by any past users before
creating one for itself.  This in effect leaves only one symbolic link at a
time and prevents past users from downloading the file again without going
through this script.  There appears to be no problem if a symbolic link is
deleted while another person is downloading from that link.

This is not too great if not many people download the file since the symbolic
link will not be deleted until another person downloads the same file.

Anyway enjoy:

<?php
$letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);
$string = '';
for ($i = 1; $i <= rand(4,12); $i++) {
   $q = rand(1,24);
   $string = $string . $letters[$q];
}
$handle = opendir($downloaddir);
while ($dir = readdir($handle)) {
   if (is_dir($downloaddir . $dir)){
      if ($dir != "." && $dir != ".."){
         @unlink($downloaddir . $dir . "/" . $filename);
         @rmdir($downloaddir . $dir);
      }
   }
}
closedir($handle);
mkdir($downloaddir . $string, 0777);
symlink($safedir . $filename, $downloaddir . $string . "/" . $filename);
Header("Location: " . $downloadURL . $string . "/" . $filename);
?>

Symlinks on windows  are created by Symlink() which accept only absolute paths 
but not relative paths .relative paths on windows are not supported for
symlinks
===============================================================================

sym/hard linking i love to do it relative a lot but not that trivial when
thinking wrong :-)
manpage says: the target is the _linkname_ and from that point to create
relative links successful is to start from the directory where the link should
be created e.g.:
/myfiles/now/here/
/myfiles/links/

chdir( realpath(dirname($target)));
You need to create/find out the relativ path to the source, otherwise the
absolut path will be used in a link.

if you start to create the target path from the source eg:
"/myfiles/now/here/../../later/" and links should go to /myfiles/later/ you
need to use realpath( dirname() ) set the new location using chdir() and start
from here to link to the source which is ../now/here/
This you can find out e.g.: when having the absolut path of source and target:
$dirTo = realpath(dirname($to));
chdir($dirTo);
$linkName = basename($to);
$target = $dirTo . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $linkName;
$srcFile = getRelativeDirectory($from, $to); //basicly a function which will
find the from -> to, but in this case the from ist the target where you need to
start.
below you can find some examples how to split the path in chunks to find a
relativ path
===============================================================================

On IIS (Internet Information Services), you need to set permissions to allow
the creation of symbolic links.

Go to Local Security Policy -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment and
right click on Create symbolic links -> Properties -> Add User or Group and add
the "IUSR" user, which should be the user associated with IIS.
A restart may be required.

If this doesn't work, go to IIS Manager -> Authentication -> select Anonymous
Authentication -> Edit and enter your current logged in user, which should be
an administrator.
Hit OK and now the symlink() function in php should work fine.
===============================================================================

function _symlink( $target, $link ) {
  if ($_SERVER['WINDIR'] || $_SERVER['windir']) {
    exec('junction "' . $link . '" "' . $target . '"');
  } else {
    symlink($target,$link);
  }
}

function _unlink($link ) {
  if ($_SERVER['WINDIR'] || $_SERVER['windir']) {
    exec('junction -d "' . $link . '"');

This function sometimes just fails to work for no appearent reason, returning
FALSE and not creating a symlink. Doing the same with exec('ln -s source dest')
works perfectly. I recommend using the latter.
===============================================================================

Be warned that at least with php 5.3 on windows 2008 R2 the symlink function is
effected by the statcache.

I got error 183 indicating the link existed. While the symlink was actually
moved to a different location by  another process and would certainly not exist
anymore.
Calling clearstatcache with a filename does not work. Most probably as the
filename is converted to a device path (e.g. "\Device\HarddiskVolume1\D-Drive\
www\pp\#static\index.html") which is a requirement for the windows call.

easiest is to just call clearstatcache without a filename to resolve the issue.

if you really want to call clearstatcache with a filename you could use
readlink on the already deleted symlink (that still lives in the statcache) to
get the filename.
For example something like this:
<?php
if(@symlink('d:/www/pp/#static/index.html','d:/www/index.html')===false){
//link failed, perhaps a statcache issue? We try to get the target, if it is a
statcache issue this should work just fine

if(($rl = @readlink($target))===false) return false; //not a cache issue as
stat on a non-existing file failed, something else must be wrong...

//clear the stat cache for the actual target, strangely enough this works
even-though this is the target and not the symlink to be created (*)
clearstatcache(true,$rl);

if(@symlink($source,$target) ===false) return false; //can't create the symlink
?>

*It looks for PHP on windows like the statcache is maintained on the target
instead of the actual symlink (this would ease in getting the file properties
and limit the size of the statcache)
===============================================================================

The one difference to using symlinks for controlled file access vs. readfile()
is that the HTTP server will handle content-type of the symlink automatically.

If you always want it to be downloaded, this can be a negative point. However,
if you want a file of non-predefined type to be viewable in the browser, this
can be a real asset.

Of course, you can use fileinfo/mime-magic to do that, but those require a
module which isn't always available on shared hosting.
===============================================================================

Olszewski_marek makes a good suggestion, but the readfile() function can also
be used to obscure file downloads from end users.

/* Setup the file that will be sent */
$downloadDir = "some/secret/directory/";
$file = "theFileName.dat";

/* Required for IE, otherwise Content-disposition is ignored */
if(ini_get('zlib.output_compression')) ini_set('zlib.output_compression',
'Off');

/* Output HTTP headers that force "Save As" dialog */
header("Pragma: public");
header("Expires: 0");
header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0");
header("Cache-Control: private",false);
header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\\"$file\\";");
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header("Content-Length: ".@filesize($downloadDir.$file));

/* Prevent the script from timing out for large files */
set_time_limit(0);

/* Send the entire file using @ to ignore all errors */
@readfile($downloadDir.$file);

/* Exit immediately so no garbage follows the file contents */
exit;
===============================================================================

To make your code portable on unix AND win32, do the following
1. Download http://www.dynawell.com/reskit/microsoft/win2000/linkd.zip
2. Unzip, put linkd.exe in C:\Windows\System32 or C:\WINNT\System32
3. Include in your code the following
<?
function _syslink($t /*target*/ ,$l /*link*/ ) {
if ($_SERVER["WINDIR"]) {
  $p=dirname($_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"])."/";
  exec("linkd ".$p.$t." ".$p.$l);
} else syslink($t,$l);
}
function _unlink($l /*link*/ ) {
if ($_SERVER["WINDIR"]) {
  $p=dirname($_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"])."/";
  exec("linkd ".$p.$l." /D");
} else unlink($l);
}
?>

_symlink(TARGET,LINK) works like symlink() on *nix
_unlink(LINK) to delete properly the link created
===============================================================================

If symlink seems not to work correctly, try to define the target argument as an
absolute path.
Coding on MacOsX PHP5.5, I noticed that in some cases using an absolute path on
the target argument was the only way I could have a proper symlink created.
===============================================================================

Context:  php cli on windows OS.

Do not forget to start the console with "Run as Administrator" else symlink
will return 'false' and raise the following error :
Warning: symlink(): Cannot create symlink, error code(1314)
===============================================================================

On Linux with PHP 5.4.5 i run into a strange Problem when creating a symlink.
My script tests with is_link() and is_file() for a symlink and if its not
exists, creating this with symlink. So far no problems. But if i manual delete
this symlink and this script runs short after, the script does not found the
symlink as aspected. But the script fails when creating the symlink with:
"symlink(): File exists"

<?php
if(is_link($symfile) and is_file($symfile)) echo 'yah!';
else symlink($orginalfile, $symfile); // error :(
?>

clearstatcache() does not work, as aspected, because is_link/is_file already
works.

But I figured out a short workaround with using rename:

<?php
if(is_link($symfile) and is_file($symfile)) echo 'yah!';
else{
    $randfile = 'anywhere_with_rights/random_name';
    symlink($orginalfile, $randfile);
    rename($randfile, $symfile);
    // voilà ... no error
    }
?>
===============================================================================

Um, duh... that's all I gotta say about by previous note. Please delete it. :)

Windows Vista has its own symlink program now (mklink). Hopefully future
versions of PHP for Windows will have this function put it?

Anyway, this will work on Vista (assuming your PHP user has the proper
permissions):
<?php
define('SYMLINK_FILE', 0);
define('SYMLINK_DIR', 1);
define('SYMLINK_JUNCTION', 2);
function symlink ($target, $link, $flag = SYMLINK_FILE) {
    switch ($flag) {
       case SYMLINK_DIR: $pswitch = '/d'; break;
       case SYMLINK_JUNCTION: $pswitch = '/j'; break;
       case SYMLINK_FILE:
       default: $pswitch = ''; break;
    }
    // Change / to \ because it will break otherwise.
    $target = str_replace('/', '\\', $target);
    $link = str_replace('/', '\\', $link);
    return exec('mklink ' . $pswitch . ' "' . $link . '" "' . $target . '"');
}
?>
===============================================================================

Keep in mind when using a shared filesystem such as NFS, that you probably
don't want to create a symbolic link with absolute paths e.g.

On Server1 you are running a PHP script that needs to create a symbolic link
called widget2 which links to widget1 inside an NFS share mounted on your
localhost at /mnt/nfs/widgets

On Server2 this same NFS share is mounted under /usr/local/widgets

If you used absolute paths on Server1, then Server2 would try to reference /mnt
/nfs/widgets/widget1 which it won't be able to find...

You need to cd into the directory first, then create the link - that way the
link will be relative. Unless you run the PHP script from the same directory
where you'll be creating the symbolic links, then you can't use symlink(). Use
exec() instead as follows:

<?php

exec("cd <nfs mount path>; ln -s <target> <link_name>");

?>
===============================================================================

Olszewski seems pretty good, but just to boost the security a bit, the fifth
line of his script should read
<?
...
    $q = rand(1,26);
...
?>

instead of rand(1,24).
===============================================================================

Remember to use absolute paths in both $target and $link.
Use $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] plus your desired paths.
===============================================================================

Olszewski's method of creating downloadable links on the fly is pretty good.

I use a different technique under Apache where if you want a file, you might
use a url like:

mydomain.com/files/mysecretfile.doc

But in fact Apache redirects this to a script with a url like:

mydomain.com/utilities/downloadfile.php?filename=mysecretfile.doc

(The browser address bar will still show the first url).

The script downloadfile.php can then handle all the mucky stuff like checking
session variables to see if someone is logged on, whether they have access to
mysecretfile.doc, and if you want to encrypt before download.

An advantage of this is that the php code to achieve the equivalent of
Olszewski's is shorter, so might execute faster. But more importantly, a casual
hacker might think all he has to do is find myverysecurefile.doc under the /
home/user/public_html/files/mysecretfile.doc, or copy the url - but there's
nothing there! He won't find it or get an Apache error page.

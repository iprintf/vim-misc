===============================================================================

"realpath_cache_size" is used by PHP to cache the real file system paths of
filenames referenced instead of looking them up each time.  Every time you
perform any of the various file functions or include/require a file and use a
relative path, PHP has to look up where that file really exists. PHP caches
those values so it doesn’t have to search the current working directory and
include_path for the file you are working on.
If your website uses lots of relative path files, think about increasing this
value.  What value is required can be better estimated after monitoring by how
fast the cache fills using realpath_cache_size() after restarting. Its contents
can be viewed using realpath_cache_get().
===============================================================================

Note that the realpath cache is not used if either safe_mode is on or an
open_basedir restriction is in effect.
This is having a huge performance effect, causing lots of calls to lstat.

===============================================================================

Realpath_cache_size default parameter settings are too low (16k).
In the windows and Polish language assessed following be at least a 32k or 64k.
otherwise appache sometimes locks up (especially when using IE).

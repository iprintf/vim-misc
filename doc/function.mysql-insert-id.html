mysql_insert_id

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

mysql_insert_id — 取得上一步 INSERT 操作产生的 ID

说明

int mysql_insert_id ([ resource $link_identifier ] )

mysql_insert_id() 返回给定的 link_identifier 中上一步 INSERT 查询中产生的
AUTO_INCREMENT 的 ID 号。如果没有指定 link_identifier，则使用上一个打开的连接。

如果上一查询没有产生 AUTO_INCREMENT 的值，则 mysql_insert_id() 返回 0。如果需要
保存该值以后使用，要确保在产生了值的查询之后立即调用 mysql_insert_id()。

    Note:

    MySQL 中的 SQL 函数 LAST_INSERT_ID() 总是保存着最新产生的 AUTO_INCREMENT 值
    ，并且不会在查询语句之间被重置。

Warning

mysql_insert_id() 将 MySQL 内部的 C API 函数 mysql_insert_id() 的返回值转换成
long（PHP 中命名为 int）。如果 AUTO_INCREMENT 的列的类型是 BIGINT，则 
mysql_insert_id() 返回的值将不正确。可以在 SQL 查询中用 MySQL 内部的 SQL 函数
LAST_INSERT_ID() 来替代。

Example #1 mysql_insert_id() 例子

<?php
    mysql_connect("localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password") or
        die("Could not connect: " . mysql_error());
    mysql_select_db("mydb");

    mysql_query("INSERT INTO mytable (product) values ('kossu')");
    printf ("Last inserted record has id %d\n", mysql_insert_id());
?>

===============================================================================

If you insert a data row by using the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause in an
INSERT-statement, the mysql_insert_id() function will return not the same
results as if you directly use LAST_INSERT_ID() in MySQL.

See the following example:

<?
   // insert a datarow, primary key is auto_increment
   // value is a unique key
   $query = "INSERT INTO test (value) VALUES ('test')";
   mysql_query( $query );

   echo 'LAST_INSERT_ID: ',
          mysql_query( "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()" ),
          '<br>mysql_insert_id: ',
          mysql_insert_id();

?>

This will print:

LAST_INSERT_ID: 1
mysql_insert_id: 1

In this case the function returns the same as the MySQL-Statement.
But see the insert on an existing key:

<?
   $query = "INSERT INTO test (value)
                  VALUES ('test')
                  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE value = 'test2'";
   mysql_query( $query );

   echo 'LAST_INSERT_ID: ',
          mysql_query( "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()" ),
          '<br>mysql_insert_id: ',
          mysql_insert_id();

?>

This will print:

LAST_INSERT_ID: 2
mysql_insert_id: 1

By using the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause, only the old datarow will be
modified, if the INSERT statement causes a duplicate entry, but the
LAST_INSERT_ID() function returns the next auto_increment value for the primary
key, which is by the way not set as the next auto_increment value in the
database.

The mysql_insert_id() function returns the primary key of the old (and changed)
data row. For me this is the right operation method, because the LAST_INSERT_ID
() function returns a value which is not referenced to a data row at all.

I thought this would be relevant to all the people using mysqli and looking for
the ID after INSERT command :

<?php
function insert_join($catid, $disc_id) {
// insert a new item into the database
   $conn = db_connect();
   // insert new item
   $demande = "insert into categories_disc values ('', '".$catid."', '".
$disc_id."')";
   $resultat = $conn->query($demande);
   if (!$resultat) {
     return false;
   } else {
    return $conn->insert_id; // function will now return the ID instead of
true.
}

}
?>

Then, on the other side, let us call this function as follows :

<?php
$cat_id = insert_join($catid, $disc_id);
if($cat_id !== false) {
   
        echo "<p>Category stuff was added to the database as follows : <br>";
        echo "<hr>ID de la category : ".$cat_id."</p><hr>";

        }
?>

How to get ID of the last updated row in MySQL?

75
down vote
I've found an answer to this problem :)

by Pomyk

SET @update_id := 0;
UPDATE some_table SET row = 'value', id = (SELECT @update_id := id)
WHERE some_other_row = 'blah' LIMIT 1;
SELECT @update_id;
EDIT by aefxx

This technique can be further expanded to retrieve the ID of every row affected
by an update statement:

SET @uids := null;
UPDATE footable
   SET foo = 'bar'
WHERE fooid > 5
   AND ( SELECT @uids := CONCAT_WS(',', fooid, @uids) );
SELECT @uids;
This will return a string with all the IDs concatenated by a colon.

Get current AUTO_INCREMENT value for any table

example:

$table=$db->prepare("SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM -DatabaseName-");
$table->execute();
$sonuc = $table->get_result();
while ($satir=$sonuc->fetch_assoc()){
      if (isset($satir["Name"])== "-TableName-"){
          $ai[$satir["Name"]]=$satir["Auto_increment"];
    }
}       
echo $ai["-TableName-"];
===============================================================================

I don't get all the fuss around this.

I read:
"The value of mysql_insert_id() is affected only by statements issued within
the current client connection. It is not affected by statements issued by other
clients."

See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/es/mysql-insert-id.html

I can't really see what's inaccurate about that.

"In the case of a multiple-row INSERT statement, mysql_insert_id() returns the
first automatically generated AUTO_INCREMENT value; if no such value is
generated, it returns the last last explicit value inserted into the
AUTO_INCREMENT column."

I must be missing something here but why would you insert multiple rows and
then only handle the last one with some favoured behaviour? You could just as
well insert them one at a time and then handle each row separately with the
latest id.

I can't see what's wrong with that.

However I can see what's wrong with simply using max(my_table.id_column)
because of the concurrent access issues this would imply.
===============================================================================

Just a quick note. mysql_insert_id() does work with REPLACE.
===============================================================================

There's nothing inherently wrong with using auto-increment fields. There's also
nothing wrong with the main competetive idea, which is for the database to
supply a primitive sequence of non-repeating identifiers, typically integers.
This is rather like which side of the road you drive on.

The bigger problem is when people don't understand what they are doing with
database access. It's like driving a car without really knowing the rules of
the road. Such people wind up making bad decisions without realizing it, and
then, eventually, something breaks.

Databases are complex beasts, and worth taking the time to really understand.
Learn about the implications and limitations of different approaches to solving
problems. Then, you will be prepared to pick a solution based on what has to
work.
===============================================================================

Why on earth are you all arguing about the best way to get the next
auto_increment value? The whole point is that it increments automatically. The
name should be a give away.

Don't calculate the next id, just leave the field blank and let the database
issue the id itself.
===============================================================================

Just wanted to re-iterate previous comment on receiving NULL or 0 return
statement from calling mysql_insert_id() after insert statement.

If you have multiple mysql connections (i.e. mysql_connect() or mysqli_connect
()) on the page you will need to specify the the connection you are using when
calling this function!

I.e.
mysql_insert_id($MY_CONN);
===============================================================================

Forget about using MAX to get the last inserted id. Race conditions like other
users inserting between your SELECT MAX(.. and your INSERT may render your id
unusable.

The WAY to get the id is by using mysql_insert_id() or the mysql SQL function
LAST_INSERT_ID().

Take care, if using mysql_insert_id() you should provide the resource returned
by the mysql_connect, not the resultset returned by mysql_query.
===============================================================================

Other methods seem to have problems with missing records in auto increment
sometimes you will have records 1 2 5 6 most functions would return the value
of 5 for next auto increment when indeed it would be 7. This is the only way I
found to make this work so I can use my customer number and the record number
to provide a truly unique customer number that is also useful.

$next_increment = 0;
$qShowStatus = "SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'your_table'";
$qShowStatusResult = mysql_query($qShowStatus) or die(mysql_error());
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($qShowStatusResult);
$next_increment = $row['Auto_increment'];
echo $next_increment;

then you can do something like this
echo  $next_increment ."-". rand();

My first post: I hope this is useful to someone
===============================================================================

You can't do an INSERT DELAYED and expect to get anything but zero, for it runs
in a separate thread, and mysql_insert_id() is tied to the current thread.
Vlad
===============================================================================

Using 'SELECT MAX(id)+1...' will not return the next auto_increment id. This
function is totaly unreliable by two reasons.
1. In race conditions there is no guarantee that other user will not insert new
record while your function have done its work. This will render your
"generated" last_id obsolete. It is rare case but it happens.
2. Most of all, if the last record(s) in the table is deleted the max id will
no longer match the auto_increment value, because auto_increment never repeats
numbers, it increases whenever an insert statement is completed and does not
decrease if you erase the last record!!!

e.g. If you have this table with the last record deleted:
id name
1. car
2. plane
3. truck - [erased]

auto_increment is 4
but MAX(id) is 2!!!
===============================================================================

In reply to: sly at noiretblanc dot org:

Make sure that auto_increment has an capital A as the first letter, otherwise
it WON'T work! So you have to spell it as Auto_increment... And then it works
fine.
===============================================================================

In response to treylane at example dot com.

It is very very very important that you put in an "or die" or some other form
of error handling.

Some scripts can fail invisibly and insert invalid data throughout your whole
database because of mysql_insert_id
inserting the last successful insertid rather than reporting that the last
attempt failed.

example of an or die statement.

$result = mysql_query($sql)
or die("Invalid query: " . mysql_error());
$EventID = mysql_insert_id();
===============================================================================

It's not true that mysql_insert_id() only returns the ID generated for an
AUTO_INCREMENT column by the previous INSERT query.

We can use LAST_INSERT_ID() statement that will return value for
mysql_insert_id().

Example:

$sql = "UPDATE `mytable` SET `mytable_id`= LAST_INSERT_ID(`mytable_id` + 1)
WHERE ...;

@mysql_query($sql);
$last_id = mysql_insert_id();

LAST_INSERT_ID() statement will affect mysql_insert_id().

Regards,
Buana
===============================================================================

and the primary reason to use neither of those last two solutions is both could
result in race conditions when there is more than a single user with access to
the database. when you use MAX or ORDER BY DESC LIMIT 1 you will retrieve the
maximum value from the table, at that moment. That doesn't mean another user
doesn't do an insertion in the primary and secondary table BEFORE you do your
insertion in the secondary table. You have thus inserted a row with a correct
id into the second table. Always use last_insert_id()
===============================================================================

If mysql_insert_id() returns 0 or null, check your auto increment field is not
being set by your sql query, also if you have multiple db connections like I
did, the solution is to create a seperate db connection for this query.
===============================================================================

My apologies for the error below (that was modified out of a class) - as you
cannot define a constant as an array.

replace the line:

<?

define("ID",...);

?>

with

<?

$mysql_id = mysql_query("...");

?>

$mysql_id is now an array in which the first element $mysql_id[0] holds the
last inserted id.

Apologies if anyone struggled over that one... esp. the noobs.
===============================================================================

Take care of setting an empty value for the AUTO_INCREMENT Field else you never
get a value except zero returned from mysq_insert_id() ....

Ciao Ephraim
===============================================================================

I believe the "resource link" being referred to is not what is returned from
mysql_query() but the $link returned from mysql_connect(). mysql_insert_id()
will just use the most recent connection if there is no explicit $link being
used.

So the above example in the manual page itself should behave the same with
mysql_insert_id($link) at the end instead of the mysql_insert_id() they used.
If you had multiple connections, the $link might come in handy.

Also in reading the mysql manual itself, there is some enlightening information
on the fact that this does appear to be totally safe to use because it is on a
per-connection basis.

Here's the relevant quote from the manual on LAST_INSERT_ID() which is located
here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Information_functions.html

"The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a per-connection
basis. This means the value the function returns to a given client is the most
recent AUTO_INCREMENT value generated by that client. The value cannot be
affected by other clients, even if they generate AUTO_INCREMENT values of their
own. This behavior ensures that you can retrieve your own ID without concern
for the activity of other clients, and without the need for locks or
transactions."

Sounds safe to me. I couldn't imagine this would be done any other way *but* on
a per-connection basis, otherwise chaos would ensue. The only way to test it
would be to perform a multi-thread type test. Perhaps someone is up for it and
wants to post their results somewhere? :)
===============================================================================

Apparently the value returned by mysql_insert_id() may be correct for BIGINT
auto_increment keys below the value of INT, but it may wrap to negative when
the BIGINT auto_increment passes the largest signed value of INT.  A timebomb
for very large tables...

PHP 5.2.10, MySQL 5.0.81, assume the connection and selection...

<?php
// CREATE A TABLE AND ALTER IT TO A HIGH INDEX NUMBER
$sql = "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE noise ( id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
PRIMARY KEY ) ENGINE=MEMORY";
if (!$res = mysql_query($sql)) die(mysql_error());

$sql = "ALTER TABLE noise AUTO_INCREMENT = 2147483646";
if (!$res = mysql_query($sql)) die(mysql_error());

// INSERT DATA TO ADD TO THE AUTO_INCREMENT INDEX
$kount = 0;
while ($kount < 3)
{
   $sql = "INSERT INTO noise () VALUES ()";
   if (!$res = mysql_query($sql)) die(mysql_error());
   $nid = mysql_insert_id($dbcx);
   var_dump($nid);
   $kount++;
}

// PRODUCES THIS
// int(2147483646)
// int(2147483647)
// int(-2147483648)
?>
===============================================================================

It seems that, in case of a very first INSERT, mysql_insert_id() returns 0. My
guess is that MySQL does not trigger auto increment if the table is empty. Once
an entry is present, it works as expected.
===============================================================================

A bit more on return values:
mysql_insert_id() returns 0 if you haven't actually manipulated anything yet.

Also, it returns 0 even if the DB connection is lost[0] between inserting and
calling mysql_insert_id() - so you can always count on getting an integer.

[0] By 'lost' I mean e.g. a DB crash. Actually closing the open link and then
trying to communicate with the DB will of course result in an error.
===============================================================================

You can create a extra collum like with name "key" and generate this "key"
using date() function:

$key = date("Y-m-d H:i:s:u");

Then do the INSERT

"INSERT into 'table' ('col_1', 'col_2', 'key') values ('value 1', 'value 2',
'$key')";

And now, you can SELECT the last ID

"SELECT ID from 'table' where key = '$key'";
===============================================================================

If i can't get a good increment.
I use this function

<?php
function get_new_id($table){
$select = 'select max(`id`) +1as `id` from `'.$table.'`  where `id` != <some
big id>';
$query = mysql_query($select);
$obj = mysql_fetch_object($query);
return $obj->id;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Just a reminder, mysql_insert_id() should be called after 'mysql_affected_rows
()', but BEFORE 'mysql_query("COMMIT")'.
===============================================================================

Here's an elegant way to INSERT using UPDATE syntax.

<?php
function insert_update($table,$fields,$id=NULL)
{
    if($id===NULL)
    {
        $sql="INSERT INTO $table (id) VALUES(NULL);UPDATE $table SET $fields
WHERE id = LAST_INSERT_ID()";
    }else{
        $sql="UPDATE $table SET $fields WHERE id = $id";
    }
    return $sql;
}
?>

Usage:

<?php
$table="`members`";
$fields="`username` = 'Ultimater',`userlevel` = 'member'";
if(!$profile_exists)
{
//insert a record
    $sql=insert_update($table,$fields);
    mysql_query($sql);
}else{
//update a record
    $sql=insert_update($table,$fields,5);
    mysql_query($sql);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Be careful, because this operates on the last performed query, it includes
UPDATEs and SELECTs as 'queries'. For example, this is what I set up.

INSERT post into database
UPDATE child forums with insert ID (insert ID is correct)
Insert ID = 0 because of last query
Send the user to their post - but fail because the insert ID is zero.

So store it in a variable like $insert_id instead of querying it every time.
===============================================================================

Be careful when using "insert ignore". If the unique index already exists, the
record will not be added, but it WILL give you the id of the next
auto_increment value even though it didn't create it.

<?php
$sql = "insert ignore into sometable set num=10";
mysql_query($sql) or die();
echo mysql_affected_rows()."<br>";
echo mysql_insert_id()."<br><br>";

// same record, database is unique on 'num'
$sql = "insert ignore into sometable set num=10";
mysql_query($sql) or die();
echo mysql_affected_rows()."<br>";
echo mysql_insert_id()."<br><br>";
?>

would give:
1
116372

0
116373
===============================================================================

This might be obvious, but it tripped me up - be careful when using
last_insert_id() with persistent connections - running last_insert_id() after a
failed update/insert/etc will return the last insert id of the last successful
update/insert made by that CONNECTION rather than 0 for the number of rows
updated by the previous non-working query, and who knows what the last query
run on that connection was.
===============================================================================

If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert it into a
second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
    VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table

...found here:
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Getting_unique_ID.html

It works even without inserting the NULL value for some reason ;)
The following is great for monitoring:
    $new_id = mysql_insert_id();
    print "New id: $new_id\n";

Hope it helps you all, cheers.
===============================================================================

"Why on earth are you all arguing about the best way to get the next
auto_increment value? The whole point is that it increments automatically. The
name should be a give away."

Because you need the same last id value in another table. So you need a way to
identify it, in order to use it in the next query. This way its easier than
using a new query to get the id like ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1
===============================================================================

If you use this function after doing an INSERT ... SELECT to insert multiple
rows at once, you get the autonumber ID of the *first* row added by the INSERT.

e.g. if there are 4 records in table 'init' that have column 'type' = 2
I want to add these 4 records to table 'game'
Table game has an autonumber column 'game_id' that is currently at 32.

If I do this query:

INSERT INTO game (type, players, rounds)
SELECT type, players, rounds FROM init
WHERE type = 2

Then mysql_insert_id() will return 33, not 36.
===============================================================================

any zerofills on your id get chopped off on this function because it returns an
int.
===============================================================================

When used in transactions, mysql_insert_id() MUST be called before committing.
Otherwise, it will return unpredictable results.
===============================================================================

As mentioned by frumler at the-beach dot no_spam dot net

the LAST_INSERT_ID works like a charm when inserting values into tables.

I'm not sure why anyone would need mysql_insert_id() when LAST_INSERT_ID is
readily available.

example:

Say you have a table called "transaction" and a table called "accounts". 
Obviously each account must be created using a transaction, so every time a
record is created in the accounts table, a record must be created in the
transaction table containing the same account_id(auto_increment) that was just
created by mysql.

Here's a simple way to do this:

<?php
$account_query="INSERT INTO accounts (account_id,type) VALUES (NULL,'saving')";
$transaction_query="INSERT INTO transactions(transaction_id,account_id) VALUES
(NULL,LAST_INSERT_ID)";

$a_query=mysql_query($account_query);
$t_query=mysql_query($transaction_query);

?>
===============================================================================

It's possible to do the same with M$ Server.

function odbc_insert_id()
{
  $query = "SELECT @@IDENTITY AS ID;";
  $result = odbc_exec($this->m_rConnectionID, $query);
  $row = odbc_fetch_object($result);
  return $row->ID;
}
===============================================================================

Beware, mysql_insert_id() only returns the value of the last syntaxically
correct insert statement.

If your code has a problem and the insert is not understood by the server then
the value of the last working insert command is returned.

Put something else in place such as "select count( id ) from table" before and
after the mysql_insert_id() call to ensure that a row was inserted.
===============================================================================

To get the NEXT insert id use the mysql query SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE
'tablename' and get the field auto_increment...

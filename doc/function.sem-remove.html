===============================================================================

sem_remove() shouldn't be part of a normal cleanup/teardown and should be
called very rarely due to bugs in the implementation.

It doesn't seem to hurt to leave semaphores lying around and is likely to be
more performance-friendly to do so.  If you are concerned about having too many
semaphores floating around for an application (e.g. a file cache that uses ftok
()), you can use some modulus arithmetic and simple addition to create a
limited range of values for your semaphores off in the middle of nowhere.  For
example, ftok() % 101 + 0xBADBEEF.  Be sure to replace 0xBADBEEF with your own
random value.  The example limits the range to 101 semaphores.  101 is a prime
number - so if you want more or less, be sure to replace it with a prime number
since primes theoretically help distribute values more evenly.

cubrid_close — Close CUBRID connection

说明

bool cubrid_close ([ resource $conn_identifier ] )

The cubrid_close() function ends the transaction currently in process, closes
the connection handle and disconnects from server. If there is any request
handles not closed yet at this point, they will be closed. It is similar to the
CUBRID function cubrid_disconnect().

参数

conn_identifier

    The CUBRID connection identifier. If the connection identifier is not
    specified, the last connection opened by cubrid_connect() is assumed.

返回值

TRUE, when process is successful.

FALSE, when process is unsuccessful.

范例

To expand on Matt Walsh's example, a simple way to get eBay, or Amazon, web
service timestamps is as follows:

<?php

$current_time = urlEncode(subStr(date("c"), 0, 19)."Z");

?>

In other words, take the date/time of now (in ISO 8601 format), discard the
trailing Daylight Savings Time specifier, add a "Z" where the DST was and
urlEncode the whole thing to convert the time's colons for REST requests
(required for amazon, not sure about eBay).

Another way might be to create your own timestamp:

<?php

$current_time = urlEncode(date("Y-m-d")."T".date("H:i:s")."Z");

?>

This way however takes a little more coding on the line.

As far as performance goes, I'm not sure which may be quicker. I just like
things to work and work well, don't much care for how fast they are as long as
they get the job done :)

A much simpler way to get the eBay, or Amazon, web service timestamp is as
follows:

<?php

$current_date = gmDate("Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z");

?>

Enjoy!

The ISO8601 output format doesn't jive with (at least) what eBay expects in its
SOAP transactions.  eBay wants a UTC time with a 'Z' suffix.   That is, eBay
(and I'm guessing other web services) will accept "2007-05-04T17:01:17Z" but
not "2007-05-04T17:01:17+0000".  As it is, the built-in DateTime::ISO8601
format uses the +0000 timezone specifier even when in a UTC timezone.

As a workaround, I do this:

<?php
   function get_ebay_UTC_8601(DateTime $time)
   {  $t = clone $time;
      $t->setTimezone(new DateTimeZone("UTC"));
      return $t->format("Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z");
   }
?>

If you are studying date_format because you want to format a date, consider the
power of date(..) !!!!

the mktime article has an example of adding days to a date of your choice and
then formatting it:
echo date("M-d-Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 32, 1997))
where the 32 is like adding 1 day to the 31st .

Even after so many distro releases, in PHP v5.5.9 and libcurl v7.35.0,
curl_multi_select still returns -1. The only work around here is to wait and
proceed like nothing ever happened. You have to determine the "wait" required
here.

In my application a very small interval like usleep(1) worked. For example:

<?php
        // While we're still active, execute curl
        $active = null;
        do {
            $mrc = curl_multi_exec($multi, $active);
        } while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);
   
        while ($active && $mrc == CURLM_OK) {
            // Wait for activity on any curl-connection
            if (curl_multi_select($multi) == -1) {
                usleep(1);
            }
   
            // Continue to exec until curl is ready to
            // give us more data
            do {
                $mrc = curl_multi_exec($multi, $active);
            } while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);
        }
?>

Internally php curl_multi_select uses libcurl curl_multi_fdset function and its
libcurl documentation says :
http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_multi_fdset.html

"When libcurl returns -1 in max_fd, it is because libcurl currently does
something that isn't possible for your application to monitor with a socket and
unfortunately you can then not know exactly when the current action is
completed using select(). When max_fd returns with -1, you need to wait a while
and then proceed and call curl_multi_perform anyway. How long to wait? I would
suggest 100 milliseconds at least, but you may want to test it out in your own
particular conditions to find a suitable value.

When doing select(), you should use curl_multi_timeout to figure out how long
to wait for action."

Untill PHP implements curl_multi_timeout() we have to play with our application
and determine the "wait".
===============================================================================

curl_multi_select($mh, $timeout) simply blocks for $timeout seconds while
curl_multi_exec() returns CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM. Otherwise, it works as
intended, and blocks until at least one connection has completed or $timeout
seconds, whatever happens first.

For that reason, curl_multi_exec() should always be wrapped:

<?php
  function full_curl_multi_exec($mh, &$still_running) {
    do {
      $rv = curl_multi_exec($mh, $still_running);
    } while ($rv == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);
    return $rv;
  }
?>

With that, the core of "multi" processing becomes (ignoring error handling for
brevity):

<?php
  full_curl_multi_exec($mh, $still_running); // start requests
  do { // "wait for completion"-loop
    curl_multi_select($mh); // non-busy (!) wait for state change
    full_curl_multi_exec($mh, $still_running); // get new state
    while ($info = curl_multi_info_read($mh)) {
      // process completed request (e.g. curl_multi_getcontent($info
['handle']))
    }
  } while ($still_running);
?>

Note that after starting requests, retrieval is done in the background - one of
the better shots at parallel processing in PHP.
===============================================================================

On php 5.3.18+ be aware that curl_multi_select() may return -1 forever until
you call curl_multi_exec().
See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=63411 for more information.
===============================================================================

This function blocks the calling process until there is activity on any of the
connections opened by the curl_multi interface, or until the timeout period has
expired.
In other words, it waits for data to be received in the opened connections.

Internally it fetches socket pointers with "curl_multi_fdset()" and runs the
"select()" C function.
It returns in 3 cases:
1. Activity is detected on any socket;
2. Timeout has ended (second parameter);
3. Process received any signal (#man kill).

The function returns an integer:
* In case of activity it returns a number, usually 1.
I suppose, it returns the number of connections with activity detected.
* If timeout expires it returns 0
* In case of error it returns -1

Thanks for attention, hope this helps.
===============================================================================

In 5.3.9+, curl_multi_select always returns -1. If this is your case, just wait
a bit and then proceed like nothing ever happened:
<?php
do { 
    $mrc = curl_multi_exec($multi, $active); 
} while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM); 
   
while ($active && $mrc == CURLM_OK) {
    //check for results and execute until everything is done

    if (curl_multi_select($multi) == -1) {
        //if it returns -1, wait a bit, but go forward anyways!
        usleep(100);
    }
   
    //do something with the return values
    while(($info = curl_multi_info_read($multi)) !== false){
        if ($info["result"] == CURLE_OK){
            $content = curl_multi_getcontent($info["handle"]);
            do_something($content);
        }
    }
    do { 
        $mrc = curl_multi_exec($multi, $active); 
    } while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);         
}
?>
===============================================================================

According to https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=61141:

On Windows setups using libcurl version 7.24 or later (which seems to
correspond to PHP 5.3.10 or later), you may find that this always returns -1.
This is, apparently, not strictly a bug: according to the libcurl
documentation, you should add your own sleep if curl_multi_select returns -1.

For example:
<?php
/* setup $mh */

$active = null;
do {
    $mrc = curl_multi_exec($mh, $active);
} while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);

while ($active && $mrc == CURLM_OK) {
    if (curl_multi_select($mh) == -1) {
        usleep(100);
    }
    do {
        $mrc = curl_multi_exec($mh, $active);
    } while ($mrc == CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM);
}

/* close $mh */
?>
===============================================================================

Since the docs are still lacking, here's an example of how to use the function.
The following code will keep checking all active threads until one of them
returns the HTTP 200 Ok status code, or simply end. On success, it will return
the URL that worked.

<?php
$running=null;
do {
    curl_multi_exec($mh,$running);
    $ready=curl_multi_select($mh); // this will pause the loop
    if($ready>0){
        while($info=curl_multi_info_read($mh)){
            $status=curl_getinfo($info['handle'],CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
            if($status==200){
                $successUrl=curl_getinfo($info['handle'],CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL
);
                break 2;
            }
        }
    }
} while ($running>0 && $ready!=-1);
?>

The question for the $ready variable is, if it will return the value before or
after the timeout has occurred. From my tests it appears that it will return
the value immediately, and only then pause the execution. That's because it's
always zero the first time through the loop, even if the time limit is as high
as 10sec. I've expected it to wait and only then return the value so that came
unexpected to me.

As stated by someone else, it also doesn't seem to return the overall count of
threads in the handle, but only that of the currently active ones.

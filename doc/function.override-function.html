(PECL apd >= 0.2)

override_function — Overrides built-in functions

说明

bool override_function ( string $function_name , string $function_args , string
$function_code )

Overrides built-in functions by replacing them in the symbol table.

参数

function_name

    The function to override.

function_args

    The function arguments, as a comma separated string.

    Usually you will want to pass this parameter, as well as the function_code
    parameter, as a single quote delimited string. The reason for using single
    quoted strings, is to protect the variable names from parsing, otherwise,
    if you use double quotes there will be a need to escape the variable names,
    e.g. \$your_var.

function_code

    The new code for the function.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 override_function() example

<?php
override_function('test', '$a,$b', 'echo "DOING TEST"; return $a * $b;');
?>

I thought the example was not very helpful, because it doesn't even override
the function with another function.
My question was: If I override a function, can I call the ORIGINAL function
within the OVERRIDING function?
ie, can I do this:
<?php
override_function('strlen', '$string', 'return override_strlen($string);');
function override_strlen($string){
        return strlen($string); 
}
?>
The answer: NO, you will get a segfault.

HOWEVER, if you use rename_function to rename the original function to a third
name, then call the third name in the OVERRIDING function, you will get the
desired effect:
<?php
rename_function('strlen', 'new_strlen');
override_function('strlen', '$string', 'return override_strlen($string);');

function override_strlen($string){
        return new_strlen($string); 
}
?>

I plan to use this functionality to generate log reports every time a function
is called, with the parameters, time, result, etc... So to wrap a function in
logging, that was what I had to do.
===============================================================================

Overriden function name becomes __overridden__(). That's why you can't override
two function, and that's how you can use the original function in the override.
===============================================================================

Of course you can't overwrite "functions" like require_once or print as they
are not really a function but a language construct.
===============================================================================

Please note that this function (as of v1.0.1 in PHP 5.3) will <b>not</b>
override some important built-in "functions". Specifically, those which are
actually statements/keywords, such as:

    require
    include
    require_once
    include_once
    echo
    print

I was hoping to use it to trace the chains of require/include activity among
files in a large legacy project, but it seems APD will not do what I need.
===============================================================================

Yes you can if you rename the overridden function. So you first rename original
function, then override it and finally rename the overridden one, something
like this:

rename_function('feof', 'real_feof');
override_function('feof', '$handle', 'return true;');
rename_function("__overridden__", 'dummy_feof');
===============================================================================

Maybe it's better to use overwritten function inside the override to code
something like this :
<?php
rename_function('myFunction','original_myFunction');
override_function('myFunction','$arg,…,$argN','return override_myFunction
($arg,…,$argN);');
?>

You may then give somehow "inheritance" to override_myFunction …
As a parent :
<?php
function override_myFunction($arg,…,$argN)
{    $result=original_myFunction($arg,…,$argN));
     /* CODE that manipulates the result */
     return $result;
}
?>

As a child :
<?php
function override_myFunction($arg,…,$argN)
{    /* CODE that manipulates the arguments */
     return original_myFunction($arg,…,$argN));
}
?>
===============================================================================

There is not chance to override 2 or more functions, because of the error:
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare __overridden__()

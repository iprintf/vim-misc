You shouldn't call imap_expunge until before closing the connection.
imap_delete tags a message for deletion, imap_expunge deletes all tagged
messages. i.e.:
for ($i = 0; $i < $num; $i++) {
  imap_delete($box, $i);
}
imap_expunge($box);

imap_expunge should not be in your inner loop.
===============================================================================

imap_expunge() may change order of messages which were loaded using imap_sort
().
That means, if you use foreach() on result of imap_sort() function and each
pass you move/delete a message and instantly expunge them, next cycle, messages
will have different numbers than imap_sort() returned and the script will fail.

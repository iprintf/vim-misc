MongoCursor::snapshot — Use snapshot mode for the query

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::snapshot ( void )

Use snapshot mode for the query. Snapshot mode ensures that a document will not
be returned more than once because an intervening write operation results in a
move of the document. Documents inserted or deleted during the lifetime of the
cursor may or may not be returned, irrespective of snapshot mode.

Queries with short responses (less than 1MB) are always effectively
snapshotted.

Snapshot mode may not be used with sorting, explicit hints, or queries on
sharded collections.

参数

返回值

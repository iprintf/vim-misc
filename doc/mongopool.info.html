MongoPool::info

(PECL mongo >= 1.2.3)

MongoPool::info — Returns information about all connection pools.

说明

public array MongoPool::info ( void )

Returns an array of information about all connection pools.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

Each connection pool has an identifier, which starts with the host. For each
pool, this function shows the following fields:

in use

    The number of connections currently being used by Mongo instances.

in pool

    The number of connections currently in the pool (not being used).

remaining

    The number of connections that could be created by this pool. For example,
    suppose a pool had 5 connections remaining and 3 connections in the pool.
    We could create 8 new instances of MongoClient before we exhausted this
    pool (assuming no instances of MongoClient went out of scope, returning
    their connections to the pool).

    A negative number means that this pool will spawn unlimited connections.

    Before a pool is created, you can change the max number of connections by
    calling Mongo::setPoolSize(). Once a pool is showing up in the output of
    this function, its size cannot be changed.

total

    The total number of connections allowed for this pool. This should be
    greater than or equal to "in use" + "in pool" (or -1).

timeout

    The socket timeout for connections in this pool. This is how long
    connections in this pool will attempt to connect to a server before giving
    up.

waiting

    If you have capped the pool size, workers requesting connections from the
    pool may block until other workers return their connections. This field
    shows how many milliseconds workers have blocked for connections to be
    released. If this number keeps increasing, you may want to use 
    MongoPool::setSize() to add more connections to your pool.

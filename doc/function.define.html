define

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

define — 定义一个常量

说明

bool define ( string $name , mixed $value [, bool $case_insensitive = false ] )

在运行时定义一个常量。

参数

name

    常量名。

value

    常量的值；仅允许标量和 null。标量的类型是 integer， float，string 或者 
    boolean。也能够定义常量值的类型为 resource ，但并不推荐这么做，可能会导致未
    知状况的发生。

case_insensitive

    如果设置为 TRUE，该常量则大小写不敏感。默认是大小写敏感的。比如， CONSTANT
    和 Constant 代表了不同的值。

        Note:

        大小写不敏感的常量以小写的方式储存。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 定义常量

<?php
define("CONSTANT", "Hello world.");
echo CONSTANT; // outputs "Hello world."
echo Constant; // outputs "Constant" and issues a notice.

define("GREETING", "Hello you.", true);
echo GREETING; // outputs "Hello you."
echo Greeting; // outputs "Hello you."

?>

define() will define constants exactly as specified.  So, if you want to define
a constant in a namespace, you will need to specify the namespace in your call
to define(), even if you're calling define() from within a namespace.  The
following examples will make it clear.

The following code will define the constant "MESSAGE" in the global namespace
(i.e. "\MESSAGE").

<?php
namespace test;
define('MESSAGE', 'Hello world!');
?>

The following code will define two constants in the "test" namespace.

<?php
namespace test;
define('test\HELLO', 'Hello world!');
define(__NAMESPACE__ . '\GOODBYE', 'Goodbye cruel world!');
?>
===============================================================================

This is obvious, but easy to forget: if you include a file, the include file
can only make use of constants already defined. For example:

<?php
define("VEG","cabbage");
require("another file");
define("FRUIT","apple");

// "another file":
echo VEG; // cabbage
echo FRUIT; // FRUIT
?>
===============================================================================

Be aware that if "Notice"-level error reporting is turned off, then trying to
use a constant as a variable will result in it being interpreted as a string,
if it has not been defined.

I was working on a program which included a config file which contained:

<?php
define('ENABLE_UPLOADS', true);
?>

Since I wanted to remove the ability for uploads, I changed the file to read:

<?php
//define('ENABLE_UPLOADS', true);
?>

However, to my surprise, the program was still allowing uploads. Digging deeper
into the code, I discovered this:

<?php
if ( ENABLE_UPLOADS ):
?>

Since 'ENABLE_UPLOADS' was not defined as a constant, PHP was interpreting its
use as a string constant, which of course evaluates as True.
===============================================================================

The value of a constant can be the value of another constant.

<?php

define("NEW_GOOD_NAME_CONSTANT", "I have a value");
define("OLD_BAD_NAME_CONSTANT", NEW_GOOD_NAME_CONSTANT);

echo NEW_GOOD_NAME_CONSTANT; // current
echo OLD_BAD_NAME_CONSTANT; // legacy

?>
===============================================================================

Found something interesting.  The following define:

<?php
define("THIS-IS-A-TEST","This is a test");
echo THIS-IS-A-TEST;
?>

Will return a '0'.

Whereas this:

<?php
define("THIS_IS_A_TEST","This is a test");
echo THIS_IS_A_TEST;
?>

Will return 'This is a test'.

This may be common knowledge but I only found out a few minutes ago.

[EDIT BY danbrown AT php DOT net: The original poster is referring to the
hyphens versus underscores.  Hyphens do not work in defines or variables, which
is expected behavior.]
===============================================================================

An improvement on the function from bobbykjack at yahoo dot co dot uk on the
concept by richard dot quadling at bandvulc dot co dot uk:
<?php
function adefine($constant_name, $value=null) {
    static $increment = 0; // 1 for bitmask

    if (is_null($value)) {
        define($constant_name, ++$increment); // $increment=$increment<<1 for
bitmask
    } else {
        define($constant_name, $value);
        if (is_numeric($value)) {
            $increment = $value;
        }
    }
}
?>
If you pass it a second argument it defines it normally, and resets the
increment if the value is numeric.  This way the function can replace define,
and you can reset the counter for a new set of constants.
<?php
adefine ('RULE_CALLBACK_FORMAT', 1); // 1
adefine ('RULE_CHANGE_CALLBACK_ON_ERROR'); // 2
adefine ('RULE_CHANGE_COMPARE_DATE'); // 3
adefine('KEYWORD', 'hodgepodge'); // hodgepodge <-- defined normally
adefine ('RULE_CHANGE_ON_DATE'); // 4

adefine ('ERROR_DESC', 1); // 1 <-- Counter reset
adefine ('ERROR_EXPECTED_RESULT'); // 2
?>
===============================================================================

For translating with variables and define, take also a look on the constant()
function.

Example :

<?php
define('PAYMENT_IDEAL',"iDEAL Payment ( NL only )");
define('PAYMENT_MASTERCARD',"Mastercard Payment ( international )");

$payparam='MASTERCARD';

echo constant("PAYMENT_$payparam");

// output :
// Mastercard Payment ( international )
?>
===============================================================================

define("THIS+IS_A_TEST","This is a test");
echo THIS+IS_A_TEST;

//It results 0 but with NOTICE ERROR

Rule : Don't use Operators as constant.
===============================================================================

I think worth mentioning is that define() appears to ignore invalid constant
names.
One immediate implication of this seem to be that if you use an invalid
constant name you have to use constant() to access it and obviously that you
can't use the return value from define() to tell you whether the constant name
used is invalid or not.

For example:
$name = '7(/!§%';
var_dump(define($name, "hello")); // outputs bool(true)
var_dump(constant($name)); // outputs string(5) "hello"
===============================================================================

When going back to rewrite code, it might be tempting to have a constant &
reference a variable, but it doesn't work.

<?php
header("Content-type: text/plain");
$variable = "value";
define("MYCONSTANT", &$variable);
  echo $variable."\n";
  echo MYCONSTANT."\n";
  echo "------\n";
$variable = "different";
  echo $variable."\n";
  echo MYCONSTANT;
?>

Produces this:

value
value
------
different
value

I doubt it's supposed to work, either. :)
===============================================================================

In case someone else is curious like me, defining a variable to "false",
actually undefining it:

define ("A", false);

if (defined("A"))
echo A;

will echo nothing. Useful, when you need to define, for example, log and keep
definition without actually having it defined.
===============================================================================

Some people like to have an ambiguous, engine-agnostic database include
specified by assigning a single config variable to one of a series of
constants.  Unfortunately, this can easily become needlessly clunky if these
defines are handled in an included config.php file, since more than one hook
will throw an ugly "already defined" error.

Here's a simple way to accomplish this architectural model without having to
create a bunch of clumsy sanity checks that compromise scalability:

<?php

/* Available databases.  --Kris */
$dbengines = array();
$dbengines[] = "mysql";
$dbengines[] = "mysqli";
$dbengines[] = "pgsql";

foreach ( $dbengines as $engine )
{
    if ( !defined( "_" . strtoupper( $engine ) . "_" ) )
    {
        define( "_" . strtoupper( $engine ) . "_", $engine );
    }
}

/* Which database engine shall we use?  --Kris */
$sql_type = _MYSQLI_;

?>
Then, somewhere later in the stack....

<?php

/* Include the file with the desired sql class.  --Kris */
require_once( $sql_type . ".php" );

/* Now you can use the same code for any supported db engine.  --Kris */
$sql = new sql();
$res = $sql->query( .... );
===============================================================================

A note on redefining:

Constants can't be redefined:

$ php -r "define('A', 1); var_dump('A'); define('A', 2); var_dump('A');";
string(1) "A"
PHP Notice:  Constant A already defined in Command line code on line 1
string(1) "A"

But using the case insensitive setting shows that the internal
representation is lower case:

$ php -r "define('A', 1, true); var_dump('A'); define('A', 2); var_dump('A');";
string(1) "A"
string(1) "A"

Note the lower case 'a' in the second define() here:
$ php -r "define('A', 1, true); var_dump('A'); define('a', 2); var_dump('A');";
string(1) "A"
PHP Notice:  Constant a already defined in Command line code on line 1
string(1) "A"
===============================================================================

To clear up a few thing:
Integers with 0 in front work. But since PHP (and many other languages) handle
them as octal values, they're only allowed a range of 0-7:

<?php
define('GOOD_OCTAL', 0700);
define('BAD_OCTAL', 0800);

print GOOD_OCTAL;
print '<br>';
print BAD_OCTAL;
?>

Result:
448
0

---------------------------------------

Furthermore,

writing the constant name without the quotation-marks (as mentioned in the
notes) throws an E_NOTICE and should be avoided!

<?php
define(TEST, 'Throws an E_NOTICE');
?>

Result:
Notice: Use of undefined constant TEST - assumed 'TEST'
===============================================================================

Constants can't be referenced from within quotes or (more importantly IMHO)
from within HEREDOC syntax. This is a huge drawback in my opinion. Here's two
of my workarounds:

<?php

//PHP5 only -- more efficient
$constarray = get_defined_constants(true);
foreach($constarray['user'] as $key => $val)
    eval(sprintf('$_CONSTANTS[\'%s\'] = \'%s\';', addslashes($key), addslashes(
$val)));

//PHP4+ -- less efficient because it defines (potentially) hundreds of
unnecessary constants
foreach(get_defined_constants() as $key => $val)
    eval(sprintf('$_CONSTANTS[\'%s\'] = \'%s\';', addslashes($key), addslashes(
$val)));

?>

Now you can refer to your defined constants using the $_CONSTANTS array. Note
that because this is NOT a superglobal, a few caveats apply:

<?php

//run code snippet here to define $_CONSTANTS in global scope...

$mv = $_CONSTANTS['FOO']; //works

function my_function1()
{
    $mv = $_CONSTANTS['BAR']; //doesn't work! not defined!
}

function my_function2()
{
    global $_CONSTANTS;
    $mv = $_CONSTANTS['BAR']; //ah, this works!
}

?>

I realize this is not ideal, either for performance or for convenience of being
able to refer to constants without regard to scope, but it is a workaround that
works. Depending on your application, it may be easier to shift your paradigm a
bit and use the following method instead, declaring your constants as variables
first:

<?php

//first, define our constants...
$_CONSTANTS['FOO'] = 'bar';
$_CONSTANTS['BAR'] = 'foo';

//now, turn them into real constants...
foreach($_CONSTANTS as $key => $val)
    define($key, $val);

//now, you can use either format to refer to a constant
print($_CONSTANTS['FOO']);   //prints 'bar'
print(FOO);                  //prints 'bar'
print("$_CONSTANTS['FOO']"); //prints 'bar'
                             //prints 'blah bar blah'
print <<<EOF
  blah {$_CONSTANTS['FOO']} blah
EOF;

?>

Hope this helps some of you out there, I know being able to utilize my
constants in HEREDOC helped me a ton!
===============================================================================

With php 5.30 it is possible to make some "restrictions", in case u use
namespaces...
The following function allows only uppercase and, if 3 param isset, gives
E_USER_ERROR instead of E_NOTICE:

<?php
namespace bla;

function define($c,$v,$x=false) {
    $c = strtoupper($c);
    if (!defined($c)) {
        // not to use \define here, as the syntax highlighting does not work
correctly here...
        return define($c, $v, true);
    } else if ($x == true) {
        trigger_error('setting constant "'.$c.'" is not allowed', E_USER_ERROR
);
    }
    return null;
}

define('PHP_VERSION', '1');
define('PHP_VERSION', '1') || trigger_error('constant already defined', 
E_USER_NOTICE);
define('PHP_VERSION', '1', true);
?>
===============================================================================

Just like define(), defined() will check for constants exactly as specified.
So, if you want to check a constant in a namespace, you will need to specify
the namespace in your call to defined(), even if you're calling defined() from
within a namespace.

To check for a defined constant within current namespace, you can use
__NAMESPACE__ magic variable:

<?php
namespace mytest;

define('mytest\CONSTANTINE', 'value');

if (defined(__NAMESPACE__ . '\CONSTANTINE')) {
    print "Constant is defined and is valued " . CONSTANTINE;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Be aware that undefined constants are not evaluated the same as undefined
variables (which is frustratingly counter-intuitive)...

$ php -a

php > if (!DO_IT) echo "don't do it\n"; else echo "do it\n";
do it

php > var_dump(DO_IT);
string(5) "DO_IT"

php > if (!$DO_IT) echo "don't do it\n"; else echo "do it\n";
don't do it

php > var_dump($DO_IT);
NULL

You have to specifically check for the definition like so...

php > if(!defined('DO_IT') || (defined('DO_IT') && !DO_IT))echo "don't do it\
n"; else echo "do it\n";
don't do it

*sigh*
===============================================================================

This code will define every key of an array, and if its a multidimentional
array it will define it as parent_child1_child2_etc.

<?php
function define_array( $array, $keys = NULL )
{
    foreach( $array as $key => $value )
    {
        $keyname = ($keys ? $keys . "_" : "") . $key;
        if( is_array( $array[$key] ) )
            define_array( $array[$key], $keyname );
        else
            define( $keyname, $value );
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

I'm reffering to the note below by mittiprovence.

The described behavior has nothing to do with the fact that there is a constant
in the condition.

Comparing a non-numeric string to the integer 0 by using == will return true,
since the string will be casted to integer - which will be zero. If your string
starts with a number, it will be castet to an integer with the number as value.

To avoid the described behavior, you should use === instead of ==.

Finally, the behavior discribed by mittiprovence is exacly the expected
behavior as defined in the manual.

For further information read the manual:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php

http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php

http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php #
language.types.string.conversion

<?php

if (0 == "some string") { // is true
echo "0 == 'some string'";
}

if (1 == "some string") { // is false
echo "1 == 'some string'";
}

if (1 == "1 some string") { // is true
echo "1 == '1 some string'";
}

if (0 === "some string") { // is false
echo "0 === 'some string'";
}

===============================================================================

Hi,

Here is a trick to use constants within the heredoc notation.

<?php
define('MY_CONSTANT','foo bar')
$cst = 'cst';
function cst($constant){
    return $constant;
}

$string = <<<EOF
My constante MY_CONSTANT : {$cst(MY_CONSTANT)} ...
EOF;
echo $string;
?>

That will echo :

My constante MY_CONSTANT : foo bar ...

As you can use function within the heredoc notation the idea is to use a
fonction to return the value of the constant.
Be carefull, to use a function, it's necessary to declare the name of the
function as a variable and to use that varaible during the "call" of the
constant.

It works for me and doesn't seem too messy.

Hope that will help.
===============================================================================

Watch out. You can define a new constant with the name NULL with define
("NULL","FOO");. But you must use the function constant("NULL"); to get it's
value. NULL without the function call to the constant() function will still
retrieve the special type NULL value.
Within a class there is no problem, as const NULL="Foo"; will be accessible as
myClass::NULL.
===============================================================================

Wonder how to work with variable which name is stored in a constant?
Here it is:
<?php
define("VAR_NAME","test");
// assigning value
${VAR_NAME} = "value";
// getting value back
echo ${VAR_NAME};
?>
===============================================================================

a basic function to auto assign a numeric value that increase by itself each
time - used in some permission style scripts

<?php
function define_bitwise($constant_name, $reset = False)
{
    static $bitwise_next = 1;

    if ( $reset === True )
    {
        $bitwise_next = 1;
    }

    define($constant_name, $bitwise_next);
       
    $bitwise_next += $bitwise_next;
}
?>

when reset it set to True, resets that value to 1 and starts afresh
===============================================================================

In PHP 4.4.9, you cannot use certain names for constants.

Specifically, reserved words such as 'PRINT', 'IF', etc.

Oddly enough, you get different behaviour for some:

<?php
define('IF', 42);
echo "IF: ", IF, "<hr />\n";
?>

yields PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected T_IF

<?php
define('PRINT', 13);
echo "PRINT: ", PRINT, "<hr />\n";
?>

yields PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected ')'

Not sure if this is still true in PHP 5 or not, but it's worth noting if it is.
===============================================================================

My notice to: redeclare define -  it is possible

php -v

===============================================================================

---[Editor's Note]---
As of PHP 5.0.0 this is possible. You can define class-only constants, which
can be called like Foo::Constant1 from the outside
---[End Note]---

Please keep in mind that

class AClass {
  define ("Const1", "Value1");
  ... }

didn't work. You have to make all your constant definitions before you open the
class. So

define ("Const1", "Value1");
class AClass {
  ... }

would be correct.
===============================================================================

I'm not sure if it's version dependent, but apparently this works:
define('APPLICATION_NOW', time());

This can be quite handy for time-dependent code...

You can then do:
class foo {
  $private now = APPLICATION_NOW;
}

and have a consistent time-stamp across the application, which is nice.

Works for me in 5.2.5

I didn't think it worked before...
===============================================================================

Probably the most efficient way of creating a constant array is to put it in a
function like this:

<?php
function my_const_arr()
{
   return array
   (
      'key1' => 'val 1',
      'key2' => 'va' 2'
   );
}
?>

Then use at will like so...
<?php $my_const_arr = my_const_arr(); ?>
===============================================================================

Something I found out the "hard" way today: integers starting with 0 won't
work.
<?php
define('SOMECONSTANT', 09900);
var_dump(SOMECONSTANT);
?>
Produces int(0)

<?php
define('SOMECONSTANT', 9900);
var_dump(SOMECONSTANT);
?>
Produces int(9900)
===============================================================================

How to define an array as constant with define?

there is a simple way to define an array of values as constant...

just

define ("constant-name","value1,value2,value3,value4");

$t_array = preg_split('/,/', constant(constant-name), -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);

var_dump($t_array);

array(4) { [0]=> string(6) "value1" [1]=> string(6) "value2" [2]=> string(6)
"value3" [3]=> string(6) "value4" }

Now you can iterate over the array defined as constant ...
===============================================================================

Intersting to note:

I found this in php5 on windows

If you try to unset a constant (which you cant but maybe you have a Jr.
programmer or something).  The error message that is thrown is:

<?php
define ("SOME_CONSTANT", true);
unset (SOME_CONSTANT);
?>

Parse error: parse error, unexpected ')', expecting T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM
===============================================================================

I want to show you how to define multiple things at once

just use this small function: ( i'm trying to do it even smaller... but i think
is small enough )

<?php function …define($a){foreach($a as $k => $v)define($k, $v);} ?>

usage example:

<?php
…define(array(
    "second" => 1,
    "minute" => 60,
    "hour" => 3600,
    "day" => 86400,
    "week" => 604800,
    "month" => 2592000, // 30 days month
    "year" => 31536000,
    "year2" => 31622400
));
?>

PLEASE NOTE:
there AREN'T three points, there is the three points CHARACTER, to be sure,
just copy paste my code
===============================================================================

In PHP,  define does not have the same gotchas as the C-preprocessor. E.g.

//In PHP:
define ("x", 5+2);    //x is evaluated as 7
echo 3 * x;             //This is 21, as you'd expect.

//But in C:
#define x   5+2;       //x is the string "5+2", substituted later.
printf ("%d",  3*x);  //This is 17.
===============================================================================

You can store your constant as the value of a variable like this:

$variable=VARIABLE;

To access the constant, do this:  constant($variable).

Beware: if your variable changes, then you loose your reference to the constant
- but the constant itself will not change.

I've found this especially useful for storing the constant string   (i.e.
VARIABLE) in a database.
===============================================================================

Note that define don't care at all about the constant name, you can give
everything as a constant name, even if the PHP documentation says that the
allowed characters are [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*

Just try this :

<?php define('anything::()$', 'test'); ?>

You won't be able to access this constant though, it will throw a parse error,
either through constant() or define(), but if you do that :

<?php print_r(get_defined_constants()); ?>

You will see that the constant is registered at the end of the array. Yes
that's totally useless. But you can try other things that will work with
constant() :

<?php define('...', 'test'); echo constant('...'); ?>

Will echo 'test'. Yeah that's a pretty strange behavior.

And please note that defining object constants outside of objets don't work :

<?php
class myObject { }
define('myObject::CONSTANT', 'test');
?>
===============================================================================

Referring to "This-Is-A-Test" constant below.

When echoing it the script thinks you performing a series of minus
(subtraction) thus since THIS and IS, A, TEST are not defined they are 0 by
default. So 0-0-0-0 = 0.

As explained that a hyphen cannot be used within a variable.
===============================================================================

Just in case:

You cannot set a constant to be a class.  For example:
define ("WSDLCLIENT",new soapclient(WSDLSERVER, 'wsdl'));

You cannot do this.
===============================================================================

just a note to the previous post by e s lin d sey at g mail dot co m:

Well as u said, it is not the best workaround. To resolve this "Problem"
without getting incredible loss of performance, you are able to make the use of
"variable functions" like "variable variables":

<?php
$def = 'constant';
$string = <<<END
    This is PHP running on<br />
    {$def('PHP_OS')}
END;
var_dump($string);
?>

In this example we make use of the "constant" function which is builtin, and it
will output:

string(37) " This is PHP running on
WINNT"

Tested on PHP 5...
Best regards
===============================================================================

Better pack with define() for all who really miss Java package management:

Use this "manifest.php" on very first script start or copy it to your
config.somehow.php.

<?php
$__packages = array(
    "org.ilove.java.more",
    "org.ilove.python.too",
    "net.php.isok"
);

define("C_IS_WINDOWS", false);
define("C_DIR", (C_IS_WINDOWS ? "\\" : "/"));
define("C_PATH_ROOT", str_replace("/", C_DIR, $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]).C_DIR
);
define("C_PATH_CORE", C_PATH_ROOT."core".C_DIR);
define("C_PATH_CLASS", C_PATH_CORE."classes".C_DIR);
define("C_APPLICATION_BASE", C_PATH_CORE.C_DIR."application".C_DIR);

$total_packages = 0;
$i = sizeof($__packages);
while($i-- > 0) {
    $tokens = explode(".", $__packages[$i]);
    $j = sizeof($tokens);
    while($j-- > 0) {
        $token = strtolower(trim($tokens[$j]));
        if(strlen($token) > 0 && !defined($token)) {
            define($token, ($j == 0 ? C_PATH_CLASS : "").$tokens[$j].C_DIR);
            $total_packages++;
        }
    }
}
define("C_PACKAGE_COUNT", $total_packages);
?>

With restrictions on non-package constants, you now can call your files like
that:

<?php

require_once org.ilove.java.more."Than.php";

?>

Constant name must not written as string. The following code works also:

<?php
define(MY_NAME, 'value');
define('ANOTHER_NAME', 'value2');

if(defined('MY_NAME')) {
  echo MY_NAME . '<br />';
}

if(defined('ANOTHER_NAME')) {

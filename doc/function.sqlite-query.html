SQLiteDatabase::query

(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_query -- SQLiteDatabase::query — Executes a query against a given
database and returns a result handle

说明

resource sqlite_query ( resource $dbhandle , string $query [, int $result_type
= SQLITE_BOTH [, string &$error_msg ]] )
resource sqlite_query ( string $query , resource $dbhandle [, int $result_type
= SQLITE_BOTH [, string &$error_msg ]] )

面向对象风格 (method):

public SQLiteResult SQLiteDatabase::query ( string $query [, int $result_type =
SQLITE_BOTH [, string &$error_msg ]] )

Executes an SQL statement given by the query against a given database handle.

参数

dbhandle

    The SQLite Database resource; returned from sqlite_open() when used
    procedurally. This parameter is not required when using the object-oriented
    method.

query

    The query to be executed.

    Data inside the query should be properly escaped.

result_type

    可选的 result_type 参数接受常量，且决定返回的数组如何被索引。使用
    SQLITE_ASSOC 会仅返回关联索引（已命名字段），而 SQLITE_NUM 会仅返回数值索引
    。SQLITE_BOTH 会同时返回关联和数值索引。SQLITE_BOTH 是此函数的默认值。

error_msg

    The specified variable will be filled if an error occurs. This is specially
    important because SQL syntax errors can't be fetched using the 
    sqlite_last_error() function.

    Note: 为兼容其他数据库扩展(比如 MySQL)，支持两种可替代的语法。推荐第一种格
    式，函数的第一个参数是dbhandle。

返回值

This function will return a result handle 或者在失败时返回 FALSE. For queries
that return rows, the result handle can then be used with functions such as 
sqlite_fetch_array() and sqlite_seek().

Regardless of the query type, this function will return FALSE if the query
failed.

sqlite_query() returns a buffered, seekable result handle. This is useful for
reasonably small queries where you need to be able to randomly access the rows.
Buffered result handles will allocate memory to hold the entire result and will
not return until it has been fetched. If you only need sequential access to the
data, it is recommended that you use the much higher performance 
sqlite_unbuffered_query() instead.

更新日志

版本              说明
5.1.0 Added the error_msg parameter

注释

Warning

SQLite will execute multiple queries separated by semicolons, so you can use it
to execute a batch of SQL that you have loaded from a file or have embedded in
a script. However, this works only when the result of the function is not used
- if it is used, only the first SQL statement would be executed. Function 
sqlite_exec() will always execute multiple SQL statements.

When executing multiple queries, the return value of this function will be
FALSE if there was an error, but undefined otherwise (it might be TRUE for
success or it might return a result handle).

    buffer all data
  • sqlite_array_query() - Execute a query against a given database and returns
    an array

I suppose this could be useful for users attempting to use a sqlite database
for the first time.
<?php
$database = new SQLiteDatabase($yourfile, 0666, $error);
if (!$database) {
    $error = (file_exists($yourfile)) ? "Impossible to open, check permissions"
: "Impossible to create, check permissions";
    die($error);
}
$query = $database->query("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'", 
SQLITE_ASSOC, $query_error); #Lists all tables
if ($query_error)
    die("Error: $query_error"); #This means that most probably we catch a
syntax error
if (!$query)
    die("Impossible to execute query.") #As reported above, this means that the
db owner is different from the web server's one, but we did not commit any
syntax mistake.
print $query->numRows();
while ($row = $query->fetch())
    print($row['name']."\n");
?>
i suppose that the example above is also useful because it will list all the
tables created, giving also comprehension of what appens when managing a sqlite
database in OO mode.
===============================================================================

Not a lot of examples on using the oo style of using sqlite files.  Maybe this
helps someone trying to figure out all the names of the tables inside an sqlite
file.

<?php

/* Just extend the class, add our method */
class MySQLiteDatabase extends SQLiteDatabase {

   /* A neat way to see which tables are inside a valid sqlite file */
   public function getTables()  {
      $tables=array();
      $q = $this->query(sprintf("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=
'table' ORDER BY name"));
      $result = $q->fetchAll();
      foreach($result as $tot_table) {
         $tables[]=$tot_table['name'];
      }
      return($tables);
   }
}

/* a sqlite file */
$database="BLAHBLAH.sqlite";

if (file_exists($database)) {
   $db = new MySQLiteDatabase($database, 0666, $err);
   if ($err) {
      trigger_error($err);
   } else {
      print_r($db->getTables());
   }
}

/* this sqlite db had 2 tables:
   Array
   (
   [0] => Account
   [1] => Device
   )

*/
?>

In follow up to Csaba Gabor's function (see below) that allows for
multi-statement queries to be executed via sqlite_query() this alternative
implementation avoids a problem with Csaba's version (which prevents
multi-statement constructs like CREATE TRIGGER from being parsed correctly).
<?php
function sqlite_query_multi ($db, $query) {
//
// sqlite_query() rewritten to support concatenated SQL statements.
//
// This method works around the sqlite_query() deficiency by splitting
// queries into two parts; the first part comprising all the statements
// except the last one (executed via sqlite_exec) and then the last
// statement (executed via sqlite_query).
//
// This allows the result of the last SELECT statement in a multi-statement
// query to be accessed regardless of the SQL statements that came before it.
// It also allows execution of arbitrary multi-statement programs regardless
// whether the result is needed, subject to the following constraint:
//
// This method requires that the last statement in a multi-statement query
// is a valid "stand-alone" SQL statement. If it is not (eg, the "END;" of
// a multi-statement construct such as CREATE TRIGGER) append an additional
// ";" (ie, a NULL statement). Normally this should not be needed because
// almost all the multi-statement constructs I can think of should have a
// stand-alone statement following them (ie, to makes use of the construct).
//
    $pattern = '/^(.*;)(.*;)/s';
    if ( preg_match($pattern,$query,$match) ) {
     // multi-statement query
        sqlite_exec($db,$match[1]);
        $result = sqlite_query($db,$match[2]);
    } else {
     // single-statement query
        $result = sqlite_query($db,$query);
    }
    return (@$result);
}
?>

Correction:

sqlite_query will return NULL if the web server cannot write to the sqlite
database file.

(please correct the previous post and delete this one)
===============================================================================

sqlite_open will return NULL if the web server cannot write to the sqlite
database file.

I saw the following message in my web server error log:

PHP Warning:  sqlite_query(): (null) ...

It turns out that the sqlite database file was owned by a user other than the
one the web server was running as.  In my case, it was a Linux system running
Apache (which was running under the context of user apache).  The sqlite
database file was owned by root.  I changed ownership of the file to user
apache and now it works!  The sqlite_open call now returns a valid result
handle.

While reading the manual at sqlite.org, I can answer for the quotes in strings.
You should put two quote to get one.

insert into atable values ( '5 O''Clock');
===============================================================================

The function below allows you to submit multiple queries in one shot to a
SQLITE database, and will return whatever you would get for the final query.

function sqlite_query_multi ($db, $query) {
    // submit multiple queries (separated by ;) to $db
    // and return the result from the last one
    $multiSQL = "/('[^']*'|\"[^\"]*\"|[^;'\"])*;/";
    preg_match_all ($multiSQL, "$query;", $aSQL);
    for ($i=sizeof($aSQL=$aSQL[0]);$i--;)
    if (!($trim=trim(substr($aSQL[$i],0,-1))))
        unset ($aSQL[$i]);
        else $aSQL[$i] = "$trim;";
    foreach ($aSQL as $i => $sql)
    $dbRes = sqlite_query ($db, $sql);
    return (@$dbRes);
}

The section below illustrates the above function:

$db = sqlite_open(":memory:", 0666, $sqliteerror);
$query = <<<EOD
CREATE TABLE foo (bar INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, baz TEXT);
INSERT INTO foo VALUES (Null, 'Hi');
INSERT INTO foo VALUES (Null, 'Mom');
SELECT * FROM foo;
EOD;
$dbRes = sqlite_query_multi ($db, $query);  // 4 statements
while (sqlite_has_more($dbRes))
    var_dump(sqlite_fetch_array($dbRes, SQLITE_ASSOC));

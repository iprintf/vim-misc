说明

final public MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern::__construct ( string $w [, integer
$wtimeout [, boolean $journal ]] )

Creates a new WriteConcern.

参数

w

                                 Write concern
            Value                              Description
                           Requests acknowledgement that the write operation
    1                      has propagated to the standalone mongod or the
                           primary in a replica set. This is the default write
                           concern for MongoDB.
                           Requests no acknowledgment of the write operation.
    0                      However, this may return information about socket
                           exceptions and networking errors to the application.
    <integer greater than  Numbers greater than 1 are valid only for replica
    1>                     sets to request acknowledgement from specified
                           number of members, including the primary.
                           Requests acknowledgment that write operations have
                           propagated to the majority of voting nodes,
                           including the primary, and have been written to the
    MongoDB\Driver\        on-disk journal for these nodes.
    WriteConcern::MAJORITY
                           Prior to MongoDB 3.0, this refers to the majority of
                           replica set members (not just voting nodes).

                           A string value is interpereted as a tag set.
    string                 Requests acknowledgement that the write operations
                           have propagated to a replica set member with the
                           specified tag.

wtimeout

    How long to wait (in milliseconds) for secondaries before failing.

    wtimeout causes write operations to return with an error (WriteConcernError
    ) after the specified limit, even if the required write concern will
    eventually succeed. When these write operations return, MongoDB does not
    undo successful data modifications performed before the write concern
    exceeded the wtimeout time limit.

                        Write concern timeout
             Value                         Description
    0                        Block indefinitely. This is the default.
    <integer greater than 0> Milliseconds to wait until returning.

journal

    Wait until mongod has applied the write to the journal.

错误／异常

  • Throws MongoDB\Driver\Exception\InvalidArgumentException on argument
    parsing errors.
  • Throws MongoDB\Driver\Exception\InvalidArgumentException if w is invalid or
    wtimeout is negative.

范例

Example #1 MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern::__construct() example

<?php

/* Request write acknowledgement from the majority of the replica set nodes */
$wc = new MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern(MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern::MAJORITY, 
500);

/
* Request write acknowledgement from a node configured with the "MultipleDC" tag *
/
$wc = new MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern("MultipleDC", 500);

?>

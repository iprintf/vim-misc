fann_get_learning_rate

(PECL fann >= 1.0.0)

fann_get_learning_rate — Returns the learning rate

说明

float fann_get_learning_rate ( resource $ann )

The learning rate is used to determine how aggressive training should be for
some of the training algorithms (FANN_TRAIN_INCREMENTAL, FANN_TRAIN_BATCH,
FANN_TRAIN_QUICKPROP). Do however note that it is not used in FANN_TRAIN_RPROP.

The default learning rate is 0.7.

参数

ann

    Neural network resource.

返回值

The learning rate, or FALSE on error.

xml_set_object

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

xml_set_object — 在对象中使用 XML 解析器

描述

pool xml_set_object ( resource $parser , object &$object )

该函数使得 parser 指定的解析器可以被用在 object 对象中。所有的回叫函数（
callback function）都可以由 xml_set_element_handler() 等函数来设置，它们被假定
为 object 对象的方法。

Example #1 xml_set_object() 示例

<?php
class xml  {
    var $parser;

    function xml() 
    {
        $this->parser = xml_parser_create();

        xml_set_object($this->parser, $this);
        xml_set_element_handler($this->parser, "tag_open", "tag_close");
        xml_set_character_data_handler($this->parser, "cdata");
    }

     function parse($data) 
    {
        xml_parse($this->parser, $data);
    }

    function tag_open($parser, $tag, $attributes) 
    {
        var_dump($parser, $tag, $attributes); 
    }

    function cdata($parser, $cdata) 
    {
        var_dump($parser, $cdata);
    }

    function tag_close($parser, $tag) 
    {
        var_dump($parser, $tag);
    }

} // end of class xml

$xml_parser = new xml();
$xml_parser->parse("<A ID='hallo'>PHP</A>");
?>

I finally managed to get xml_set_object() to work, after much documentation
searching.  As the solution I found has been hinted at, the focus has been
wrong.

There have been many problems getting class contained XML parsers to make
changes to the members of an instance.  This is because, from what I'm
guessing, the functions are using a either a new annonymous instance of the
class or an uninstanced version of the class.

What we want to make sure it does it that the parser is accessing its handlers
as member methods of a particular instance of a class.  This can be done using
the array method for passing a callback, setting the object as a reference to
this instance.  This way, you know that the parser is going to call the
function properly.

Ex:
<?php
class Parser {

private $parser;
private $data;

public function __construct() {
  $this->parser = NULL;
  $this->data = '';
}

private function ParseElementStart($parser, $name, $attrs) {
  // Code
}
private function ParseElementEnd($parser, $name) {
  // Code
}

public function Parse($XMLdata) {
  $this->parser = xml_parser_create();
  xml_set_object($this->parser, $this);
  xml_set_element_handler($this->parser,
                          array(&$this, 'ParseElementStart'),
                          array(&$this, 'ParseElementEnd'));
  xml_parse($this->parser, $XMLdata);
  xml_parser_free($this->parser);
}
}
?>

With this, when you call the Parse method, the data in that instance can be
modified.  I'm not sure if xml_set_object becomes unneccissary when using the
array callbacks, but I leave it in just to make sure that the xml_parse
function knows it's in the object.

As above, I'd recommend for memory sake, that the XML parser be created, used,
and freed all in the same function, to ensure that everything is cleaned up
correctly.
===============================================================================

Just a note about creating abstract "call back handlers" as mentioned in some
of the other notes.  In this case I recommend extending the base XML class and
overwritting the handler methods.  The reason I wanted to do this, is that if
you have a separate callback method class it causes problems, for example if
you want to collect information out of the XML file and store it in an array. 
You can get around it with global variables, but I prefer to use them only when
required ;)

Example:

<?php
class xml_output extends xml{

  var $output = array();

   function xml_output(){
    $this->xml();
   }

    //overwrite base methods
    function tag_open($parser, $tag, $attributes)
    {
        array_push($this->output, "<$tag, attributes>");
    }

    function cdata($parser, $cdata)
    {
         array_push($this->output, "$cdata");
    }

    function tag_close($parser, $tag)
    {
         array_push($this->output, "</$tag>");
    }

}

$xml_parser = & new xml_output();
$xml_parser->parse("<A ID='hallo'>PHP</A>");
echo("$xml_parser->output");
?>
===============================================================================

Adding to 'lmfe at mega dot ist dot utl dot pt' contribution below, I have to
say that this behaviour is very usual for PHP if MemberVars of an Object arent
initialized from the constructor.
What worked best for me so far was something like this:
<?php
class foo {
  var $bar
  // the constructor
  function foo() {
    unset($this->bar);  // with every instanciation, the variable is cleared
for the object
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Using PHP 4.3.0, I got this strange behaviour:

<?php
class xml  {

     /* (as specified in the documentation above) */

} // end of class xml

/* This code works */
$xml_parser = new xml();
$xml_parser->parse("<A ID='hallo'>PHP</A>");

/* This code works */
$xml_parser2 = new xml();
$xml_parser2->parse("<A ID='hallo2'>PHP2</A>");

/* This code DON'T work */
$xml_parser = new xml();
$xml_parser->parse("<A ID='hallo3'>PHP3</A>");
?>

In the third block of code, php complains it can't find the handlers it needs.
It seems this problem only happens if the variable is used more than once.
Calling xml_parser_free doesn't help
===============================================================================

(Adding to zitan's note)
It seems easy enough to provide output functions for callback handler classes
too.

Example:

<?php
class CallBack {
    var $name = 'Callback';
    var $info = 'Information!';
    function toString() {
        return $this->name.': '.$this->info;
    }
}
class Main {
    var $name = 'Main';
    var $callBackObject;
    function setCallBack(&$cBIn) { $this->callBackObject = $cBIn; }
    function toString() {
        return $this->name.': '.$this->callBackObject->toString();
    }
}

$cb = & new CallBack;
$m = & new Main;
$m->setCallBack(&$cb);
echo $cb->toString();
echo $m->toString();
?>

So, after collecting information during the parse operation within the callback
handler class, e.g. in tag_close(), retrieving them is possible.
===============================================================================

passing the object as a call-time ref (&$this) as in the example will create a
warning in php 4.1+. Pass xml_set_object($xp,$this); instead. This does not
seem to break anything - but I dont know for sure.
===============================================================================

Just adding a little note about my above written example.  It needs some
improvements.

Because PHP passes by VALUE by default, when you pass an array like this:
array($callback_handler, 'handler_method')
PHP makes a copy of the callback_handler object and uses the handler_method in
the copy.

This is not an ideal situation for many reasons...which I will not get into
here...but you should have an idea by now.

The best way to fix this is to change a few things. In the function declaration
change the parameter from $callback_handler to &$callback_handler. So now your
declaration should look like this

function set_callback_handler(&$callback_handler)
{
  ...
}

Now each time you reference $callback_handler change it to &$callback_handler. 
For example:

xml_set_element_handler(
          $this->xml_parser,
          array(&$callback_handler, 'start_element'),
          array(&$callback_handler, 'close_Element' ));

This ensures that PHP will always use the same object.
===============================================================================

xml_set_object is great, if you want to hard code your start_element,
end_element, etc functions within your xml class.

But what if you want to increase the modularity of your application?

Solution, create one generic XMLParser class that handles everything *except*
the callback funtions.  Then create an abstract XMLCallbackHandler class which
you can extend to provide any customization you want.

So how do you tell the php's xml_parser that you want to use this other class
to handle the callback functions.

xml_set_object?  This only works if the functions are *within* the object you
called this method from.

The solution lies in the xml_set_element_handler() function.
Take a look at this sample source...

class XMLParser
{

  ...

  function set_callback_handler($callback_handler)
  {
    // Assign the startElement endElement functions
    xml_set_element_handler(
          $this->xml_parser,
          array($callback_handler, 'start_element'),
          array($callback_handler, 'close_Element' ));

    /* By passing an array with this ($object, 'function_name') structure
       to the 2nd and 3rd parameters.  We are able to tell the parser to
       look in another object for these callback functions.
    */

    // Assign the character data function
    xml_set_character_data_handler(
          $this->xml_parser,
          array($callback_handler, 'character_data'));
    }
}

class myCallBackHandler
{
  function start_element(...)
  {
    //code goes here
  }

  function end_element(...)
  {
    //code goes here
  }

  function character_data(...)
  {
    //code goes here
  }
}

Now all thats left to do is use these classes..

$parser = new XMLParser();
$parser->set_callback_handler(new myCallbackHandler());
===============================================================================

English explaination of why you do: $xml = & new xml();

Ok, when PHP executes "new xml()" it creates an anonymous variable (one that
you can't reference with any name) which it then runs the constructor function
on.  Ok, now once that's done, it then assigns by VALUE in the example above. 
This means that that lovely pointer to your parser is pointing to the anonymous
instance of your class, and not the used instance of your class... thus making
a "shadow" of all your variables, where assignments inside the parser access
different variables than outside the parser.  What PHP _SHOULD_ be doing
(similar to C++) is have this statement execute such that the assignment is
done by REFERENCE, so that you assign the new name to the class that actually
got constructed, and not just a copy of the class that you constructed.

If they did it right, this code wouldn't be broken.
===============================================================================

Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated, so the example is buggy as was
already mentionned. However since 4.04 (I think) "new" can return objects by
reference. So the clean way to have both the parser initialised in the
constructor, and to save the result in your object is to do

$xml_parser = & new xml();

<p>in reply to jon9mm's question, I have found the same problem (function
'startElement' does not exist).  I finally found the way around this, by
re-reading this doc for xml_set_object.  You HAVE to use the xml_set_object
($this->parser, &$this) within your parser function.</p> <p>When that function
is called, your object temporarily becomes the parser object and shares scope
(so it can see 'startElement', etc).   Once that function is done, the
xml_set_object(...) call goes out of scope, and your object is no longer bound
to the parser.  So the simplist solution is to call xml_set_object(...), do any
parsing, and then call xml_parser_free(...) all within the same function.</p>
<p>And remember, don't call xml_set_object(...) in your object's constructor -
your object will be forever bound to the parser object and you'll loose all
access to your object's member functions.</p>
<p>This is all explained in the examples above, but it took me reading it a
couple of times to grok how it all works.</p>
===============================================================================

If you're using the XML parser within an object, be careful not to accidentally
call any methods that don't exist within the object. Instead of complaining
that the missing method doesn't exist, PHP will say it's not able to find the
handler routines, even if you've indicated them correctly. (PHP version 4.0.5
on FreeBSD).
===============================================================================

If xml_set_object is not called in the constructor of an object, the values
that the parser modifies will be saved. Else, the values do not seem to be
saved as stated by "i_sofer" above.
--- Start Example Code ---
class foo {
var xmlparser;
function foo() { \\the constructor
$this->xmlparser=xmlparser_create();
}
function parse() {
xml_set_object($this->xmlparser,&$this);
\\also include data handler
\\and element handlers here
}
}
--- End Example Code ---
===============================================================================

Using xml parser in objects seem to have a problem that values modified(even of
the object itself) get lost as soon as parsing ends...
===============================================================================

The example will generate a warning unless allow_call_time_pass_reference is
set to true in your INI file. It also will not accept a call by value.
===============================================================================

While true that there is no automatic destructor for PHP class objects, it is
quite simple to create a method called destroy and perform the destruction
manually. In the example above it may not be necessary to free the xml parser
immediately... it would appear from the example that the object is re-useable.

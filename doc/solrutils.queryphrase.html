You need to be careful allowing users to use raw queries if you index sensitive
information. Cross domain search timing attacks can be used to extract
information from an index [1] if your form does not have XSRF protection.

If you allow raw queries it can also allow users to DOS your application by
inputting slow queries.

Doing some tests it would appear that this function also sanitizes input
(testing on version above 1.0). And the term "phrase" is not the same as a
complete query like "FIELD:THE RIGHT HALF AFTER THE : IS THE PHRASE."

So if you want to search SOME_FIELD:some value with an escape character like +,
then you would have to write the code out:

$query  = 'SOME_FIELD:' . SolrUtils::queryPhrase('some value with an escape
character like +');

That would properly escape it like:

some value with an escape character like \+

FYI.

sqlsrv_num_rows — Retrieves the number of rows in a result set

说明

mixed sqlsrv_num_rows ( resource $stmt )

Retrieves the number of rows in a result set. This function requires that the
statment resource be created with a static or keyset cursor. For more
information, see sqlsrv_query(), sqlsrv_prepare(), or » Specifying a Cursor
Type and Selecting Rows in the Microsoft SQLSRV documentation.

参数

stmt

    The statement for which the row count is returned. The statment resource
    must be created with a static or keyset cursor. For more information, see 
    sqlsrv_query(), sqlsrv_prepare(), or » Specifying a Cursor Type and
    Selecting Rows in the Microsoft SQLSRV documentation.

返回值

Returns the number of rows retrieved on success and FALSE if an error occurred.
If a forward cursor (the default) or dynamic cursor is used, FALSE is returned.

$sql = "SELECT * FROM Table_1";
$params = array();
$options =  array( "Scrollable" => SQLSRV_CURSOR_KEYSET );
$stmt = sqlsrv_query( $conn, $sql , $params, $options );

$row_count = sqlsrv_num_rows( $stmt );
   
if ($row_count === false)
   echo "Error in retrieveing row count.";
else
   echo $row_count;
?>

===============================================================================

Try to avoid using this function if you need good performance. Specifying
"Scrollable" in the options will make you queries take ages to run. If your
result contains less than 5000 rows (might vary on different hardware) its
faster to not use "Scrollable" and loop over them in php instead.

If you need to check if a result contains rows use "sqlsrv_has_rows()", this
function works without "Scrollable". After removing all my "Scrollable"
queries, my page loadtime went from 900ms to 60ms.

To demonstrate, here is a query that returns 100 rows:
<?php
for($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
    $q = "SELECT sku,name FROM product WHERE visible = 1";
    $result = sqlsrv_query($db,$q,array(), array( "Scrollable" => 
SQLSRV_CURSOR_KEYSET ));

    while($row = sqlsrv_fetch_array($result)) {}
}
?>
This takes about 10s! Thats 10 qps..

Now if we remove "Scrollable":
<?php
for($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
    $q = "SELECT sku,name FROM product WHERE visible = 1";
    $result = sqlsrv_query($db,$q);

    while($row = sqlsrv_fetch_array($result)) {}
}
?>
This will run in 300ms, about 334 qps!
===============================================================================

Note that when migrating your MS SQL Server PHP Driver from MSSQL to SQLSRV, if
you have used mssql_num_rows, replacing them with sqlsrv_num_rows and replacing
mssql_query($query, $mssql_link) with sqlsrv_query($sqlsrv_link, $query) calls
will make your sqlsrv_num_rows calls fail. In order to avoid that, you should
specify either static, keyset or buffered cursors (buffered cursor has been
available since SQLSRV 3.0) when calling sqlsrv_query. For example,
<?php
mssql_query($query, $mssql_link);
// is equivalent to
sqlsrv_query($sqlsrv_link, $query, array(), array('Scrollable' => 'buffered'));
?>
Using the buffered cursor is "more equivalent" than using the static or keyset
cursors to simple mssql_query calls, since it caches the entire result set in
client memory.

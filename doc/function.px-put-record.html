px_put_record — Stores record into paradox database

说明

bool px_put_record ( resource $pxdoc , array $record [, int $recpos = -1 ] )

Stores a record into a paradox database. The record is always added at the end
of the database, regardless of any free slots. Use px_insert_record() to add a
new record into the first free slot found in the database.

参数

pxdoc

    Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by px_new().

record

    Associated or indexed array containing the field values as e.g. returned by
    px_retrieve_record().

recpos

    This optional parameter may be used to specify a record number greater than
    the current number of records in the database. The function will add as
    many empty records as needed. There is hardly any need for this parameter.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Returns the special root object at the top of an otherwise empty data graph.
This call is used when the application wants to create a data graph from
scratch, without having called executeQuery() to create a data graph.

The special root object has one multi-valued containment property, with a name
of the application root type that was passed when the Relational DAS was
constructed. The property can take values of only that type. The only thing
that the application can usefully do with the root type is to call 
createDataObject() on it, passing the name of the application root type, in
order to create a data object of their own application type.

参数

None.

返回值

The root object.

错误／异常

None.

范例

Please see the Examples section in the general information about the Relational
DAS for many examples of calling this method.

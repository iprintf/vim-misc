ftp_chmod

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

ftp_chmod — 设置 FTP 服务器上的文件权限

说明

int ftp_chmod ( resource $ftp_stream , int $mode , string $filename )

将服务器上的文件权限设置为 mode 指定的值。

参数

ftp_stream

    FTP 连接标示符。

mode

    要设置的权限值，八进制值。

filename

    远程文件名称。

返回值

操作成功返回文件新的权限，操作失败返回 FALSE 。

范例

Example #1 ftp_chmod() 函数例程

<?php
$file = 'public_html/index.php';

// 建立基础连接
$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

// 使用用户名和密码登录
$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);

// 尝试设置 $file 的权限为 644
if (ftp_chmod($conn_id, 0644, $file) !== false) {
 echo "$file chmoded successfully to 644\n";
} else {
 echo "could not chmod $file\n";
}

// 关闭连接
ftp_close($conn_id);
?>

Using the excellent octdec and decoct functions you can make this easy:

<?php
$mode = "644";
$mode = octdec( str_pad($mode,4,'0',STR_PAD_LEFT) );
ftp_chmod($ftp_stream, $mode, $file);
?>
===============================================================================

Just wanted to contribute a quick note for those who are still experiencing
issues with changing the permissions via FTP.

If you are having trouble with PHP recognizing the mode as an integer, you can
take the previous poster's method:

$mode = octdec ( str_pad ( $mode, 4, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT ) );

And add the following snippet right after:

$mode = (int) $mode;

This will force PHP to recognize the mode as an integer when you do:

ftp_chmod ( $conn_id, $mode, $path );

These together never seem to fail for me.
===============================================================================

It took me a while to figure out how to use this function in my situation
because I needed the $mode to be passed to this function as a variable that was
read from a database. Since the database returns the value as an integer
without a leading zero, I could not get the operation to work because adding a
leading zero in PHP turns the value into a string.

For example, this does not work in my situation:

<?php
// Assume that this is the value returned from the database.
$mode = 644;

// Now try to chmod using this value.
ftp_chmod($conn_id, $mode, 'test.txt');

// The file now has permissions of 204 and not 644
?>

Adding a leading zero doesn't work either:

<?php
// Assume that this is the value returned from the database.
$mode = 644;

// Now try to chmod using this value.
ftp_chmod($conn_id, '0'.$mode, 'test.txt');

// The file now has permissions of 204 and not 644
?>

I tried many ways to get it to work even converting it from oct to dec using
octdec and then back to decoct and nothing worked. This is the only way I was
able to get it to work, with an eval statement.

<?php
// Assume that this is the value returned from the database.
$mode = 644;

// Turn the mode into a string
$np = '0'.$mode;

// Now run chmod with the eval'd string parsed as an integer.
ftp_chmod($conn_id, eval("return({$np});"), 'test.txt');

// The file now has permissions of 644
?>

Of course, you will have to make sure that the value of $mode only contains 3
digits. Always do checking on your values before handing it off to eval().
===============================================================================

Ok,
so if 2 people say that my way is wrong and the other is right, i will take
mine back.
I posted it cause for me just the way i used it worked (i don't know why)

AND: i would not say something like: "I would try before post", in my opinion
that is realy unfriendly, cause i tryed!
===============================================================================

The "mode" parameter of the PHP5 ftp_chmod function is an integer value that is
supposed to be given as an octal number, like the argument for the "chmod"
command line tool.

Thus the sprintf must use the %o formatting character, so that the passed
integer value is really represented as an octal number to the CHMOD site
command for the FTP server.

So, IMHO, rabin's version is correct (it definitely worked for me).
===============================================================================

rabin's code works just fine as a replacement for ftp_chmod().
I would try that before trying cspiegl's solution for pre-php 5 installations.
===============================================================================

As mentioned in the note below, the function posted by "hardy add mapscene dot
com" works incorrectly if used with an octal mode, the way the php5 function is
used.

This function works exactly like the the php5 one:

<?php
if (!function_exists('ftp_chmod')) {
    function ftp_chmod($ftp_stream, $mode, $filename)
    {
        return ftp_site($ftp_stream, sprintf('CHMOD %o %s', $mode, $filename));
    }
}
?>

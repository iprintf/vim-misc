(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

dbase_open — Opens a database

说明

int dbase_open ( string $filename , int $mode )

dbase_open() opens a dBase database with the given access mode.

    Note: 当启用安全模式时， PHP 会检查被操作的文件或目录是否与被执行的脚本有相
    同的 UID（所有者）。

    Note:

    此函数受 open_basedir 影响。

参数

filename

    The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to the file
    where dBase will store your data.

mode

    An integer which correspond to those for the open() system call (Typically
    0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read and write).

        Note:

        You can't open a dBase file in write-only mode as the function will
        fail to read the headers information and thus you can't use 1 as mode.

范例

Example #1 Opening a dBase database file

<?php

// open in read-only mode
$db = dbase_open('/tmp/test.dbf', 0);

if ($db) {
  // read some data ..
  
  dbase_close($db);
}

?>

返回值

Returns a database link identifier if the database is successfully opened, or
FALSE if an error occurred.

===============================================================================

If you are wanting to open Foxpro tables using this, make sure they are in the
2.x format or php will not respond. In VFP use the following:

COPY TO tablename.dbf TYPE FOX2X

This is an easy way to bring database info to the web if you have a small
foxpro setup.
===============================================================================

COPY TO tablename.dbf TYPE FOXPLUS
The table is exported like DBase IV version and works fine with php.

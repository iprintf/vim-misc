sybase_fetch_assoc — Fetch a result row as an associative array

说明

array sybase_fetch_assoc ( resource $result )

sybase_fetch_assoc() is a version of sybase_fetch_row() that uses column names
instead of integers for indices in the result array. Columns from different
tables with the same names are returned as name, name1, name2, ..., nameN.

An important thing to note is that using sybase_fetch_assoc() is NOT
significantly slower than using sybase_fetch_row(), while it provides a
significant added value.

参数

result

返回值

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

===============================================================================

Very often you see constructs like this to loop thru a result set:

while ($row = sybase_fetch_assoc($result))
{
    while (current($row)) // or  while (current($row) != false)
    {
        $data = current($row);
        $key = key($row);
               
        //
        // do stuff here
        //
       
    next($row);   
    }
}

Do not use it in this way! You have to write the inner while loop this way:

while (current($row) !== false)

If you just use
while (current($row) != false)
or
while (current($row))

you could be in trouble and loose some data. In my case I had a query which
contained the following statement:

datediff(dd, date1, date2) as days

Now if days computes to 0 then the two while loop examples from above will exit
(because the 0 is 'seen' as false). Therefore you must use while (current($row)
!== false) which will not exit if one of you data contains 0.

For users that want this function in other applications, use this function.  I
have been using it for over a year with great success.

function sybase_fetch_assoc($query_result){
        $row = sybase_fetch_array($query_result);
        $values = "";
        if(is_array($row))
        {
        while(list($key, $val) = each($row))
            {
                $values[$key] = $val;
            }
        }
    return $values;
}

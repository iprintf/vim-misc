ob_gzhandler

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ob_gzhandler — 在ob_start中使用的用来压缩输出缓冲区中内容的回调函数。ob_start
callback function to gzip output buffer

说明

string ob_gzhandler ( string $buffer , int $mode )

ob_gzhandler()目的是用在ob_start()中作回调函数，以方便将gz 编码的数据发送到支持
压缩页面的浏览器。在ob_gzhandler()真正发送压缩过的数据之前，该函数会确定（判定
）浏览器可以接受哪种类型内容编码（"gzip","deflate",或者根本什么都不支持），然后
返回相应的输出。所有可以发送正确头信息表明他自己可以接受压缩的网页的浏览器，都
可以支持。 All browsers are supported since it's up to the browser to send the
correct header saying that it accepts compressed web pages. 如果一个浏览器不支
持压缩过的页面，此函数返回FALSE。

参数

<?php

ob_start("ob_gzhandler");

?>
<html>
<body>
<p>This should be a compressed page.</p>

<body>

注释

    Note:

    ob_gzhandler() 需要 zlib 扩展。

    Note:

    不能同时使用ob_gzhandler() 和 zlib.output_compression。也要注意使用
    zlib.output_compression 要优于 ob_gzhandler()。

I've just spent 5 hours fighting a bug in my application and outcome is:

<?php
// do not use
ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
// along with
header('HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified');

// or in the end use
ob_end_clean();
?>

W3C Standart requires response body to be empty if 304 header set. With
compression on it will at least contain a gzip stream header even if your
output is completely empty!

This affects firefox (current ver.3.6.3) in a very subtle way: one of the
requests after the one that gets 304 with not empty body gets it response
prepended with contents of that body. In my case it was a css file and styles
was not rendered at all, which made problem show up.
===============================================================================

The simplest way for gzip compression is:
<?php
if(!ob_start("ob_gzhandler")) ob_start();
?>
ob_start("ob_gzhandler") returns FALSE if browser doesn't support gzip, so then
is called normal ob_start();
===============================================================================

Here are some precisions :

- the "mode" arg accepts a bit field composed of PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_START,
PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_CONT and PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_END. See http://www.php.net/
manual/fr/ref.zlib.php#56216 for an example. The value that jazfresh recommends
below (5) is the good one, because 5 == PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_START |
PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_END.

- when called INSIDE an output buffering handler, ob_gzhandler DOES NOT return
false when the browser doesn't support compressed pages. It rather returns the
original string.
===============================================================================

According to the manual, if ob_gzhander detects that the browser is unable to
support deflate or gzip it returns FALSE.  Does this mean that if you use
ob_start("ob_gzhandler"), any browsers that do not support gzip/deflate will
receive a blank page?

I've been having problems with IE6 displaying gzipped pages and adding a test:

<?php

if (substr_count($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'], 'gzip')) ob_start(
"ob_gzhandler");

else ob_start();

?>

solved the problem.  Surely if ob_gzhandler detects a lack of support for
deflation it should return the input unchanged and not FALSE?
===============================================================================

I just spent 30 minutes wondering why my browser wasn't getting the gzipped
version :-O

If you're using Google Web Access your pages will  be delivered to the browser
uncompressed unless you tell GWA to ignore the specific site.

Obvious, really.
===============================================================================

All versions of MSIE have a bug where they don't cache gzipd contents. If your
application depends on caching, this is something to keep in mind. In the end,
I did:

<?php

// These are so benificial, they default to true.
if (!isset($use_page_cache))
    $use_page_cache = 1;
if (!isset($use_compression))
    $use_compression = 1;

// Add browsers here as we must detect them. Opera is an oddball, if we don't
detect
// it specifically, it will turn up as MSIE

$browser="other";
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) {
    $agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
    if (eregi("opera",$agent)){
    $browser="opera";
    }elseif(eregi("msie",$agent)){
    $browser="msie";
    }
}

if ($use_compression && !( $use_page_cache && $browser == "msie")) {
    // Turn on compression, makes quite a difference in bandwith usage.
    // However, MSIE (all versions) have a bug with compression and caching. So
for MSIE
    // it's either compression or caching. We choose caching.
    ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
}

session_cache_limiter("must-revalidate");

session_start();

// ... put stuff in $content ...

if ($use_page_cache) {
    // MD5 is slow, however with a fast server (PIII or better) we should be OK
    $hash = md5($content);
    $headers = getallheaders();
    if (isset($headers['If-None-Match']) && ereg($hash, $headers[
'If-None-Match']))
    {
    header('HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified');
    exit;
    }
    header("ETag: \"$hash\"");
}

print $content;

?>
===============================================================================

From what I can understand, quite some people seem to have problems with this
functionality.  If you want to do this quick, like i did, you can use the
outstanding class gzip_encode made by Leknor at http://leknor.com/code/php/view
/class.gzip_encode.php.txt
===============================================================================

In the set_error_handler notes, there is a technique described for capturing
all errors (even parse errors) before they are displayed the user, using a
special error handler and output handler. If this output handler detects a
fatal error in the output buffer, it's captured and dealt with before it can be
displayed to the user. If no error was detected, then output buffer is
displayed verbatim (i.e. without being compressed).

If you are using this method, you can still take advantage of ob_gzhandler's
compression. However, you MUST specify a mode argument (I'm using 4.2.2 on
RedHat9). The mode value affects which headers are automatically added
(Content-Encoding, etc). A value of '5' worked for me. '0' or discarding the
argument produces a blank screen under Mozilla.

<?php

function my_output_handler(&$buffer) {
  // Detect errors in the output
  if(ereg("(error</b>:)(.+) in <b>(.+)</b> on line <b>(.+)</b>", $buffer, $regs
)) {
    my_error_handler(E_ERROR, $regs[2], $regs[3], $regs[4]);
    // ...
    // ... Insert your error handling here ...
    // ...
    return 'An internal error occurred.';
  } else {
    // The page rendered without any errors, so compress
    // and output.
    return ob_gzhandler($buffer, 5);
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

About the previous note from Davey:

ob_start(array('ob_gzhandler',9));

Does not work. The output size isn t affected at all, stays the same.

ob_gzhandler compression level use zlib.output_compression_level, which is -1
per default, level 6.

To change the compression level on the fly, simply use ini_set:
<?php
ini_set('zlib.output_compression_level', 1);
ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
echo 'This is compressed at level 1';
?>
===============================================================================

When using ob_start("ob_gzhandler"), be aware that the output buffer has to be
flushed in order to invoke the ob_gzhandler callback function.

This may not always happen. For example, if you use ob_get_contents() to copy
the output buffer to a string for further manipulation and then silently
discard the buffer with ob_end_clean(), the output buffer is never "flushed"
and as a result, the ob_gzhandler callback function is never invoked. And your
pages won't be compressed.

This will be the case, for example, if you use the PHP Fusebox architecture/
framework.
===============================================================================

I have a very well tested module in my framework (ie: running in production
environments for a couple of years) called 'fastpage', which takes care of both
memcaching and gzipping for frequently requested content.  It memcaches one
version of each unique page both gzipped and non-gzipped, and returns the
appropriate version based upon the browser's Accept-encoding header.

Use is:
$page_spec = array($dependent,$variables,$go,$here);
if(!fastpage_display('content_id',$page_spec)) {
... make page here ...
fastpage_displayed('content_id',$page_spec);
}

Unfortunately, on IE8 beta (in IE8 mode, or in IE7 emulation mode), the
fastpage-enabled content was not being un-gzipped.  IE would request the
content, a 200 status and correct byte count would appear in the server
logfile, and IE would show no errors.  However, CSS would not be applied and
Javascript would not execute.

The only fix I can find right now is to disable gzip entirely for this
browser.  User agent string is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT
5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727

The same output works fine in firefox (windows, linux, mac), and in safari.

Versions are: zlib 1.2.3-r1 / php 5.2.6-r7 / lighttpd 1.4.20

So much for the 'this has been fixed in IE7' comment, above...
===============================================================================

Hi,

if you are using apache, I think you are much better of using apache's
compression, as this will also compress static text files (css, js, html, etc)
and it will keep your php-code clean.

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html for an excellent how
to.

And for other webservers, I'm pretty sure they have equivalents.

Cheers, Ronald
===============================================================================

in reply to nyarl at hotep dot co dot uk;

Your 'solution' doesn't really work since session_id() will return an empty
string if there is no session started. Therefore it will never return NULL.
Yes the problem is gone, but also is your output buffering xD

I haven't found a solution to this problem yet... It seems ie6 just doesn't
wanna play nice - like it does most of the times.
===============================================================================

I wrote a simple script that I use on my site. Bandwidth consumption dropped
dramatically. Pages shrunk 3-5 times.

The script simulates the results of using this function directly but by using
regular output buffering with ob_start. So you get to output gzip and play with
it before you do.

You can find the script with explanations here:
http://www.tellinya.com/art2/106/gzip-compress-html

Cheers and input is always welcome fellow coders!
===============================================================================

Someone previously mentioned that MSIE doesn't cache gzipped content. This is
false. He misread the source of information. In fact, IE will cache gzipped
content no matter what. Here is the quote from the mailing list:

The reason the COMPRESSED responses are, in fact,
always getting cached no matter what "Vary:" field name
is present is just as I suspected... it is because MSIE
decides it MUST cache responses that arrive with
"Content-Encoding: gzip" because it MUST have a
disk ( cache ) file to work with in order to do the
decompression.

===============================================================================

faisun at sina dot com:
If you read up on output buffering, you'll see that if an output buffer
callback returns false, this instructs PHP to output the original string
untouched.  That's why ob_gzhandler() returns false if the encoding is not
supported.   When ob_start("ob_gzhandler") is used and encoding is not
supported, ob_gzhandler() will return false and PHP outputs the original,
uncompressed string.

jsnell at e-normous dot com:
Output buffering callback functions accept up to two parameters, so this would
probably work better for your situation:

<?php
function ob_gz_handler_no_errors($buffer, $mode)
{
    @ob_gzhandler($buffer, $mode);
}

ob_start('ob_gzhandler_no_errors');
?>

However, if you're trying to suppress errors caused by headers already being
sent, it would be better to start the output buffering earlier, before any
output can be sent.
===============================================================================

If you want to suppress errors (such as for cases when headers are already
sent) and you don't want to write or patch your error_handler, you need to
create an intermediate callback:

function ob_gz_handler_no_errors($buffer)
{
    @ob_gzhandler($buffer);
}

ob_start('ob_gzhandler_no_errors');
===============================================================================

DON'T compress/gzip your Error pages :

i can think of two good reasons not to compress your error pages:
1. You want to make sure that people can read you error pages, don't you ?
2. Compressing pages have a "side effect" : it's smaller !! if you return "HTTP
/1.x 404 Document Not fount" (or any other HTTP error), MSIE will display it's
built in error message, not yours if it's small than 513bytes. (see "HOW TO:
Turn Off the Internet Explorer 5.x and 6.x 'Show Friendly HTTP Error Messages'
Feature on the Server Side" http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;
en-us;Q294807 )
===============================================================================

When writing scripts for distribution, I would usually "null" out the following
deprecated superglobals so that users who uses the script will not be able to
use them.
<?php
$HTTP_GET_VARS = null;
$HTTP_POST_VARS = null;
$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS = null;
$HTTP_POST_FILES = null;
$HTTP_SERVER_VARS = null;
?>

However, when using ob_start('ob_gzhandler'), one of those superglobals somehow
disable this function.

Found out that it was $HTTP_SERVER_VARS that's causing the problems.

<?php
ob_start('ob_gzhandler');

$HTTP_GET_VARS = null;
$HTTP_POST_VARS = null;
$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS = null;
$HTTP_POST_FILES = null;
/**
* Causing the trouble
*/
//$HTTP_SERVER_VARS = null;
?>

I don't know why it does that, but I just want to point that out.
===============================================================================

Please be aware that, as other users have already mentioned, the compression
will fail if there are characters before the php start tag "< ?".

This is also the case when saving files in UTF-8 format with editors such as
Ultraedit. Make sure you save the file using the defined option UTF-8 NO BOM or
delete the BOM otherwise the two UTF BOM characters will be written at the
start of the file.
===============================================================================

So why doesn't the web server just do this by default? 
This works for me if I do:
ini_set('zlib.output_compression_level', 3);  ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
or even just:
ob_start("ob_gzhandler");

I did the level 3 compression, I think the default was 6 and I didn't want to
put too much load on the server.  For a 895k file (my largest) the compression
levels were:
1 = 189k
3 = 178k
4 = 163k
6 = 156k    (I believe 6 is the default if you leave out the ini_set)
9 = 155k
I use http://www.whatsmyip.org/mod_gzip_test/ to check the sizes.

FYI: This works with dynamic files in Movable Type 3.x (I'm testing it in 3.2)
I've got the above command in the first line of my mtview.php file.

More info here: http://www.whatsmyip.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=43

On several sites I've read the some browsers don't like compressed CSS.
===============================================================================

if you want to send an output to the browser (which accepts gzip), and you
haven't set the buffering callback ob_start("ob_gzhandler"), you may use the
gzencode() function.

header("Content-Encoding: gzip");
echo gzencode("some output", 9, FORCE_GZIP);
===============================================================================

i had a LOT of trouble trying to get gzipping working correctly
i kept getting a blank page on the first load, although subsequent pages loaded
fine.
i tried stuff with ob_flush and ob_end_clean and all kinds of stuff i didn't
understand. i'm totally confused about different versions of php and different
methods of gzipping.

in the end, i got it working (maybe i'll understand it later).
i ended up using phpBB's code (stripped of non-gz stuff, and ever-so-slightly
modified)
http://phpbb.com/

index.php:
------------
<?php
require_once('top.php');

echo "<html>\n<head>\n<title>Gzip Test</title>\n<body>\n<h1>testing</h1>\n</

    $gzip_size = strlen($gzip_contents);

i must admit to not seeing this working in opera 7.11. perhaps i will figure
that one out.
if there is anything i should change email me and i can edit my post
===============================================================================

Following up on my previous post - it appears that while:

<?php
ini_set("zlib.output_compression", "Off"); // with no headers yet sent
// followed by the rest of your code...
?>

did not work in php 4.2.3, it did begin to work as of php 4.3.0 as an override
to the php.ini "zlib.output_compression=on" setting. I did not see this in the
change log.

In light of this, I'd say using zlib.output_compression is definitely the way
to go over ob_gzhandler() in most cases.
===============================================================================

To pass the second argument to ob_gzhandler() which specifies what level of
compression should be used (which I assume is 1-9 as with the gzip binary, with
9 using the most processor and time to do, 4 is the standard IIRC) you must
call ob_start() like so:

ob_start(array('ob_gzhandler',9));

- Davey
===============================================================================

Differences between zlib.output_compression and ob_gzhandler:

zlib.output_compression runs in parallel with script execution - it begins
compressing as soon as it receives any output from your script, and sends data
to the client each time its buffer (4K by default) gets full. ob_gzhandler
(actually 'ob_start("ob_gzhandler");') will not start compressing until the
script flushes (or, usually, exits), and will in turn send the entire
compressed document at once - which makes it more susceptible to causing a
perception of latency.

Advantage: zlib.output_compression

On the other hand, ob_gzhandler gives you script-level control allowing you to
use it selectively or to unset it after setting it in certain cases. Despite
some documentation to the contrary, zlib.output_compression does not appear to
be able to be set or unset on a script level; you must instead set it globally
(in php.ini) or in your webserver configs or .htaccess files, possibly using
FilesMatch-type mechanisms to control which scripts it will or won't apply to -
which could get unwieldy for large projects - particularly those which employ
PHP to produce images and other non-text output in addition to normal text
output.

Advantage: ob_gzhandler

Net advantage: depends on your particular needs. I'm trying
zlib.output_compression for now, but I miss the flexibility that ob_gzhandler
would provide.

p.s. here's an Apache 1.3.* httpd.conf/.htaccess file snippet that demonstrates
the syntax for conditionally setting zlib.output_compression:

<FilesMatch "\.(php|html?)$">
# turn it on with the buffer set to 2K using php_value
php_value zlib.output_compression 2048
# or just turn it on using php_flag
# php_flag zlib.output_compression On
</FilesMatch>
===============================================================================

if you get errors like:
"output handler 'ob_gzhandler' cannot be used twice"
if you are using
"ob_start("ob_gzhandler");"

check for your php.ini file, it should look like this:

output_buffering = Off  ; delete the 4096k value
output_handler =
zlib.output_compression = Off
===============================================================================

I have noticed that if you have the php setting for zlib.output_compression set
to 'On' AND you attempt to use hte ob_gzhandler handler to ob_start () the
output you get in the browser WILL be garbled in PHP 4.2.3.  I'm guessing that
the output buffering is compressing the output to be sent, and then zlib is
doing it a second time, but the browser is only uncompressing it once.

But using either one will give you the same results (compressed output from the
script)
===============================================================================

If you are trying to use the ob_gzhandler in a MSHTA (Microsoft HTML
Application) you will find that your pages does not show up. the MSHTA-browser
probably says it can handle gzip, but it just won't work (IE:6, PHP:4.1.2)
===============================================================================

Problem revelate by xn@bnw.com

cause real problem when you have a global call
to ob_gzhandler , for example in an include configuration
file , and you want send a non gzip content , for any reason ...

To resolve it ,

put this after your global call to ob_gzhandler

include("conf_that_call_ob_gzhandler.php");
-->ob_end_clean();
-->header("Content-Encoding: none");

If you try to overload the header before the the ob_gzhandler call
or during the buffering output , it will not work .
( probably erase at the call of ob_gzhandler  and not allow during
buffering ).

Hope this help
===============================================================================

RFC 2616 suggests that a more correct way to compress documents on the fly is
to use gzip transfer encoding rather than gzip content encoding.    However,
it's perhaps not advisable to use this since client support for it is extremely
limited.

The difference is most evident when you come to save a file from your browser. 
If it's gzip content encoded then the browser should (and may well) save it
gzipped.  If it's gzip transfer encoded then the browser should uncompress it
first.
===============================================================================

Following Browsers send
Accept-Encoding: gzip
but have Problems with
Content-Encoding: gzip

* netscape < 5 have problems with CSS/Javascript parts sendet in gzip
* opera 5.x,6 store downloads compressed
* lynx 2.8.4 store downloads compressed but tells this with attaching ".gz" to
the filename

You should know about:
* Internet Explorer 5.x,6 should turned to HTTP 1.1 to get "Accept-Encoding:
gzip"
* In Mozilla 1.0 RC2 you can write the "Accept-Encoding:" in Preferences/
Advanced/HTTP Networking
===============================================================================

if you call ob_end_clean() after ob_start("ob_gzhandler"), the
"Content-Encoding: gzip" header will still get sent (assuming the browser
supports the encoding).  if you don't call ob_start() again with the
ob_gzhandler callback function, the output will not be compressed, but the
header will say it is.  this causes mozilla (as of build 2002032808) to display
a blank page.
===============================================================================

To get this to work properly, you have to compile PHP with "--with-zlib". If
you don't, you won't get any errors, it just won't actually compress anything.
This is a phenomenal thing. For just a small bit of processor time, you can
DRASTICALLY reduce the bandwidth requirement of your scripts. There are very
few circumstances in which this should not be used.
===============================================================================

Seems others have had problems with IE6 giving blank pages erratically when
using ob_start("ob_gzhandler"). One reason may be that a session has already
been started, so try:

<?php
  if (session_id() === null ) ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
?>

Worked for me. :)
===============================================================================

One of the earlier posts says caching of gzipped files is broken in all
versions of MSIE. The following blog entry appears to declare that this has
been fixed in IE7, but I haven't verified this.

http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/31/487509.aspx
===============================================================================

No matter the circumstances, you MUST NOT check the user agent string to find
out if gzip compression is enabled. HTTP defines the Accept-Encoding header for
exactly this purpose and you MUST check it before enabling compression.
===============================================================================

IE 6+ appears to validate the CRC and disgard invalid gzip content FYI...
Brian
===============================================================================

It is also possible to use ob_gzhandler to compress css and javascript files,
however some browsers such as firefox expect content type text/css on css
files.

To get around this send a content type header:

<?php
ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
?>

.... your css content ...

<?php
header("Content-Type: text/css");
header("Content-Length: ".ob_get_length());
ob_end_flush();
?>
===============================================================================

So much code...here's a lighter/faster one:
<?php

if ( $do_gzip_compress )
{
    $gzip_size        = ob_get_length();
    $gzip_contents    = ob_get_clean(); // PHP < 4.3 use ob_get_contents() +
ob_end_clean()
   
    echo "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00",
         substr(gzcompress($gzip_contents, 9), 0, - 4), // substr -4 isn't
needed
         pack('V', crc32($gzip_contents)),    // crc32 and
         pack('V', $gzip_size);               // size are ignored by all the
browsers i have tested
}

exit;
?>
I wouldn't recommande using level 9, waste of CPU, something between 1 and 6
would be more resonable
I have tested without the substr/crc/size and it worked flawlessly in IE5/5.5/
6, Opera7.11/7.21, IE5.5 MAC

It may seem obvious but if you use ob_start("ob_gzhandler"),  make sure no
content is unintentionally echo'ed before : this could be blank lines before '
<?php' or after '?>' tags in included files or even errors.

Otherwise, only a part of the content (the content sent after ob_start()) will
be compressed, which will confuse the client.

Setting compression using zlib.output_compression either in php.ini or in
Apache configuration file (with directive php_flag) is safer in this regard.

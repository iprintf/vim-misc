Phar::convertToExecutable — Convert a phar archive to another executable phar
archive file format

说明

public Phar Phar::convertToExecutable ([ int $format = 9021976 [, int
$compression = 9021976 [, string $extension ]]] )


    Note:

    此方法需要将 php.ini 中的 phar.readonly 设为 0 以适合 Phar 对象. 否则, 将抛
    出PharException.

This method is used to convert a phar archive to another file format. For
instance, it can be used to create a tar-based executable phar archive from a
zip-based executable phar archive, or from an executable phar archive in the
phar file format. In addition, it can be used to apply whole-archive
compression to a tar or phar-based archive.

If no changes are specified, this method throws a BadMethodCallException.

If successful, the method creates a new archive on disk and returns a Phar
object. The old archive is not removed from disk, and should be done manually
after the process has finished.

参数

format

    This should be one of Phar::PHAR, Phar::TAR, or Phar::ZIP. If set to NULL,
    the existing file format will be preserved.

compression

    This should be one of Phar::NONE for no whole-archive compression, Phar::GZ
    for zlib-based compression, and Phar::BZ2 for bzip-based compression.

extension

    This parameter is used to override the default file extension for a
    converted archive. Note that all zip- and tar-based phar archives must
    contain .phar in their file extension in order to be processed as a phar
    archive.

    If converting to a phar-based archive, the default extensions are .phar,
    .phar.gz, or .phar.bz2 depending on the specified compression. For
    tar-based phar archives, the default extensions are .phar.tar, .phar.tar.gz
    , and .phar.tar.bz2. For zip-based phar archives, the default extension is
    .phar.zip.

返回值

The method returns a Phar object on success and throws an exception on failure.

错误／异常

This method throws BadMethodCallException when unable to compress, an unknown
compression method has been specified, the requested archive is buffering with 
Phar::startBuffering() and has not concluded with Phar::stopBuffering(), an
UnexpectedValueException if write support is disabled, and a PharException if
any problems are encountered during the phar creation process.

范例

Example #1 A Phar::convertToExecutable() example

Using Phar::convertToExecutable():

<?php
try {
    $tarphar = new Phar('myphar.phar.tar');
    // convert it to the phar file format
    // note that myphar.phar.tar is *not* unlinked
    $phar = $tarphar->convertToExecutable(Phar::PHAR); // creates myphar.phar
    $phar->setStub($phar->createDefaultStub('cli.php', 'web/index.php'));
    // creates myphar.phar.tgz
    $compressed = $phar->convertToExecutable(Phar::TAR, Phar::GZ, '.phar.tgz');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // handle the error here
}
?>

===============================================================================

Convert to executable and compress methods override any stub you have created
with their own stub which is responsible for extracting/executing self's
content.

calling setStub() after convertingToExecutable doesn't help either. As far of
php 5.3.6 (phar     2.0.1 ) if you want to have a phar archive accessible threw
the web, you'll have to create your own
index.php which will include a nonexecutable phar and act as the bootstrap.

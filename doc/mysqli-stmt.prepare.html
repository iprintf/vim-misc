mysqli_stmt::prepare -- mysqli_stmt_prepare — Prepare an SQL statement for
execution

说明

面向对象风格

mixed mysqli_stmt::prepare ( string $query )

过程化风格

bool mysqli_stmt_prepare ( mysqli_stmt $stmt , string $query )

Prepares the SQL query pointed to by the null-terminated string query.

The parameter markers must be bound to application variables using 
mysqli_stmt_bind_param() and/or mysqli_stmt_bind_result() before executing the
statement or fetching rows.

    Note:

    In the case where you pass a statement to mysqli_stmt_prepare() that is
    longer than max_allowed_packet of the server, the returned error codes are
    different depending on whether you are using MySQL Native Driver (mysqlnd)
    or MySQL Client Library (libmysqlclient). The behavior is as follows:

      □ mysqlnd on Linux returns an error code of 1153. The error message means
        "got a packet bigger than max_allowed_packet bytes".

      □ mysqlnd on Windows returns an error code 2006. This error message means
        "server has gone away".

      □ libmysqlclient on all platforms returns an error code 2006. This error
        message means "server has gone away".

参数

stmt

    仅以过程化样式：由 mysqli_stmt_init() 返回的 statement 标识。

query

    The query, as a string. It must consist of a single SQL statement.

    You can include one or more parameter markers in the SQL statement by
    embedding question mark (?) characters at the appropriate positions.

        Note:

        You should not add a terminating semicolon or \g to the statement.

        Note:

        The markers are legal only in certain places in SQL statements. For
        example, they are allowed in the VALUES() list of an INSERT statement
        (to specify column values for a row), or in a comparison with a column
        in a WHERE clause to specify a comparison value.

        However, they are not allowed for identifiers (such as table or column
        names), in the select list that names the columns to be returned by a
        SELECT statement), or to specify both operands of a binary operator
        such as the = equal sign. The latter restriction is necessary because
        it would be impossible to determine the parameter type. In general,
        parameters are legal only in Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        statements, and not in Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

Example #1 面向对象风格

<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

$city = "Amersfoort";

/* create a prepared statement */
$stmt =  $mysqli->stmt_init();
if ($stmt->prepare("SELECT District FROM City WHERE Name=?")) {

    /* bind parameters for markers */
    $stmt->bind_param("s", $city);

    /* execute query */
    $stmt->execute();

    /* bind result variables */
    $stmt->bind_result($district);

    /* fetch value */
    $stmt->fetch();

    printf("%s is in district %s\n", $city, $district);

    /* close statement */
    $stmt->close();
}

/* close connection */
$mysqli->close();
?>

Example #2 过程化风格

<?php
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

$city = "Amersfoort";

/* create a prepared statement */
$stmt = mysqli_stmt_init($link);
if (mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, 'SELECT District FROM City WHERE Name=?')) {

    /* bind parameters for markers */
    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "s", $city);

    /* execute query */
    mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

    /* bind result variables */
    mysqli_stmt_bind_result($stmt, $district);

    /* fetch value */
    mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt);

    printf("%s is in district %s\n", $city, $district);

    /* close statement */
    mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);
}

/* close connection */
mysqli_close($link);
?>

以上例程会输出：

Amersfoort is in district Utrecht

===============================================================================

Note that if you're using a question mark as a placeholder for a string value,
you don't surround it with quotation marks in the MySQL query.

For example, do this:

mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, "SELECT * FROM foo WHERE foo.Date > ?");

Do not do this:

mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, "SELECT * FROM foo WHERE foo.Date > '?'");

If you put quotation marks around a question mark in the query, then PHP
doesn't recognize the question mark as a placeholder, and then when you try to
use mysqli_stmt_bind_param(), it gives an error to the effect that you have the
wrong number of parameters.

The lack of quotation marks around a string placeholder is implicit in the
official example on this page, but it's not explicitly stated in the docs, and
I had trouble figuring it out, so figured it was worth posting.
===============================================================================

Turns out you can't directly use a prepared statement for a query that has a
placeholder in an IN() clause.

There are ways around that (such as constructing a string that consists of n
question marks separated by commas, then using that set of placeholders in the
IN() clause), but you can't just say IN (?).

This is a MySQL restriction rather than a PHP restriction, but it's not really
documented in the MySQL docs either, so I figured it was worth mentioning here.

(Btw, turns out someone else had previously posted the info that I put in my
previous comment, about not using quotation marks. Sorry for the repeat; not
sure how I missed the earlier comment.)
===============================================================================

The `prepare` , `bind_param`, `bind_result`, `fetch` result, `close` stmt cycle
can be tedious at times. Here is an object that does all the mysqli mumbo jumbo
for you when all you want is a select leaving you to the bare essential
`preparedSelect` on a prepared stmt. The method returns the result set as a 2D
associative array with the `select`ed columns as keys. I havent done sufficient
error-checking and it also may have some bugs. Help debug and improve on it.

To see sql errors from your prepare:

$stmt = mysqli_stmt_init($link);

mysqli_stmt_prepare ( $stmt ,"INSERT INTO foo
            (id, textval,whatever) values (?,?,?) or  die( print_r
(mysqli_stmt_error($stmt)));
===============================================================================

If you wrap the placeholders with quotation marks you will experience warnings
like "Number of variables doesn't match number of parameters in prepared
statement" (at least with INSERT Statements).
===============================================================================

A particularly helpful adaptation of this function and the call_user_func_array
function:

// $params is sent as array($val=>'i', $val=>'d', etc...)

function db_stmt_bind_params($stmt, $params)
{
    $funcArg[] = $stmt;
    foreach($params as $val=>$type)
    {
        $funcArg['type'] .= $type;
        $funcArg[] = $val;
    }
    return call_user_func_array('mysqli_stmt_bind_param', $funcArgs);
}

Thanks to 'sned' for the code.

i've got some bad news for you guys if you haven't found out already.
the trick with mysqli_next_result() only prevents having the connection dropped
after a stored procedure call.
apparently you can bind parameters for a prepared stored procedure call, but
you'll get messed up records from mysqli_stmt_fetch() after
mysqli_stmt_bind_result(), at least when the stored procedure itself contains a
prepared statement.
a way to avoid data corruption could be specifying the CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS
flag in mysqli_real_connect(), if it wasn't disabled entirely (for security
reasons, as they say). another option is to use mysqli_multi_query(), but then
you can't bind at all.
===============================================================================

In reference to what lachlan76 said before, stored procedures CAN be executed
through prepared statements as long as you tell the DB to move to the next
result before executing again.

Example (Five calls to a stored procedure):

<?php
for ($i=0;$i<5;$i++) {
  $statement = $mysqli->stmt_init();
  $statement->prepare("CALL some_procedure( ? )");

  // Bind, execute, and bind.
  $statement->bind_param("i", 1);
  $statement->execute();
  $statement->bind_result($results);

  while($statement->fetch()) {
    // Do what you want with your results.
  }

  $statement->close();

  // Now move the mysqli connection to a new result.
  while($mysqli->next_result()) { }
}
?>

If you include the last statement, this code should execute without the nasty
"Commands out of sync" error.
===============================================================================

Do not try to use a stored procedure through a prepared statement.

Example:

<?php
$statement = $mysqli->stmt_init();
$statement->prepare("CALL some_procedure()");
?>

If you attempt to do this, it will fail by dropping the connection during the
next query.  Use mysqli_multi_query instead.

Example:

<?php
$mysqli->multi_query("CALL some_procedure()");
do
{
  $result = $mysqli->store_result();

   // Do your processing work here 
 
  $result->free();
} while($mysqli->next_result());
?>

This means that you cannot bind parameters or results, however.
===============================================================================

If you select LOBs use the following order of execution or you risk mysqli
allocating more memory that actually used

1)prepare()
2)execute()
3)store_result()
4)bind_result()

If you skip 3) or exchange 3) and 4) then mysqli will allocate memory for the
maximal length of the column which is 255 for tinyblob, 64k for blob(still ok),
16MByte for MEDIUMBLOB - quite a lot and 4G for LONGBLOB (good if you have so
much memory). Queries which use this order a bit slower when there is a LOB but
this is the price of not having memory exhaustion in seconds.

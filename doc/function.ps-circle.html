ps_circle — Draws a circle

说明

bool ps_circle ( resource $psdoc , float $x , float $y , float $radius )

Draws a circle with its middle point at (x, y). The circle starts and ends at
position (x+radius, y). If this function is called outside a path it will start
a new path. If it is called within a path it will add the circle as a subpath.
If the last drawing operation does not end in point (x+radius, y) then there
will be a gap in the path.

参数

psdoc

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by ps_new().

x

    The x-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

y

    The y-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

radius

    The radius of the circle

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

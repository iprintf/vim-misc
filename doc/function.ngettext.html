It's useful to know how the .po-file has to look like when using ngettext:

msgid "item"
msgid_plural "items"
msgstr[0] "Produkt"
msgstr[1] "Produkte"

In php:

echo ngettext('item', 'items', $number);
===============================================================================

Example for russian lang:
file.po:
    ...
    "Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 &&
n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2;\n"
    ...
    msgid "File"
    msgid_plural "Files"
    msgstr[0] "Файл"
    msgstr[1] "Файла"
    msgstr[2] "Файлов"
    ...

file.php
    ...
    echo ngettext("File", "Files", $number);
    ...
===============================================================================

Beware of one difference between the GNU gettext API and the PHP binding of it,
which is that the GNU gettext functions that accept a $count parameter all
expect (indeed, being compiled C, require) that $count be unsigned, while the
PHP binding does not.

Thus, the PHP gettext functions will happily accept negative numbers. The one
potentially irritating consequence of this is that -1 is treated as plural,
which sits well with some people and not so well with others.  (As a picky
native speaker of English, my personal opinion is that both "the temperature is
minus one degree Fahrenheit" and "four apples minus five apples leaves minus
one apple" but others may feel that "four apples minus five apples leaves minus
one apples" sounds better.)

The upshot: You may want to abs($count) before passing numbers to gettext.

Bonus points: If your application includes user preferences, you might offer a
"treat -1 as singular" option to your users, then choose $count or abs($count)
to pass to gettext based on each user's preference.
===============================================================================

Even though "hek at theeks dot net"'s answer is valid, I would not recommend
using the abs() hack recommended. Even though it is by far the most common, not
all languages treat (n != 1) as plural. Other languages are much more complex,
for example, here is how you determine plurals in Macedonian.

n==1 || n%10==1 ? 0 : 1

In Arabic there are actually 5 different types of plurals:

n==0 ? 0 : n==1 ? 1 : n==2 ? 2 : n%100>=3 && n%100<=10 ? 3 : n%100>=11 ? 4 : 5

If you are using only specific languages that use the (n != 1) format AND -1 is
singular, by all means, use abs(), but be careful and don't forget that you
have done this when adding a new language to your project 3 years down the
road.
===============================================================================

Section 10.2.5 in the GNU gettext manual explains the ngettext function:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/

(Sorry, but the Add Note function prevents me from including a long URL which
points right to that section of the manual.)
===============================================================================

According to GNU gettext manual third argument is unsigned long integer. It
must be positive number. If n is negative, it might be evaluated incorrectly in
some languages.

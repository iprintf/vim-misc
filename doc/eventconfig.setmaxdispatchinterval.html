EventConfig::setMaxDispatchInterval — Prevents priority inversion

说明

public void EventConfig::setMaxDispatchInterval ( int $max_interval , int
$max_callbacks , int $min_priority )

Prevents priority inversion by limiting how many low-priority event callbacks
can be invoked before checking for more high-priority events.

    Note:

    Available since libevent 2.1.0-alpha .

参数

max_interval

    An interval after which Libevent should stop running callbacks and check
    for more events, or 0 , if there should be no such interval.

max_callbacks

    A number of callbacks after which Libevent should stop running callbacks
    and check for more events, or -1 , if there should be no such limit.

min_priority

    A priority below which max_interval and max_callbacks should not be
    enforced. If this is set to 0 , they are enforced for events of every
    priority; if it's set to 1 , they're enforced for events of priority 1 and
    above, and so on.

返回值

Returns TRUE on success, otherwise FALSE.

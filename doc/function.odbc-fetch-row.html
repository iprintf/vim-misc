odbc_fetch_row — Fetch a row

说明

bool odbc_fetch_row ( resource $result_id [, int $row_number ] )

Fetches a row of the data that was returned by odbc_do() or odbc_exec(). After 
odbc_fetch_row() is called, the fields of that row can be accessed with 
odbc_result().

参数

result_id

    The result identifier.

row_number

    If row_number is not specified, odbc_fetch_row() will try to fetch the next
    row in the result set. Calls to odbc_fetch_row() with and without
    row_number can be mixed.

    To step through the result more than once, you can call odbc_fetch_row()
    with row_number 1, and then continue doing odbc_fetch_row() without
    row_number to review the result. If a driver doesn't support fetching rows
    by number, the row_number parameter is ignored.

返回值

Returns TRUE if there was a row, FALSE otherwise.

When I migrates from 4 to 5 took me a long day to find the solution.

The way to use it without problems

In php4:

<?php
while (odbc_fetch_row($stringsql)) {

// ...

}
?>

In php5:

<?php

odbc_fetch_row($stringsql, 0);

while (odbc_fetch_row($stringsql)) {

// ...

}

?>

Good luck

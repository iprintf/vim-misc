xml_set_character_data_handler

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

xml_set_character_data_handler — 建立字符数据处理器

说明

bool xml_set_character_data_handler ( resource $parser , callable $handler )

为 parser 变量指向的 XML 解析器指定字符数据处理函数。

参数

parser

    XML 解析器的引用，用于建立字符数据处理器。

handler

    handler 为表示一个函数名称的字符串，该函数必须在为 parser 指定的解析器调用 
    xml_parse() 函数时已存在。

    由 handler 参数命名的函数名必须接受两个参数：
    handler ( resource $parser , string $data )

    parser
        第一个参数 parser 为指向要调用处理器的 XML 解析器的指针。
    data
        第二个参数 data 为包含有字符数据的字符串。

    Character data handler is called for every piece of a text in the XML
    document. It can be called multiple times inside each fragment (e.g. for
    non-ASCII strings).

    如果处理器函数名被设置为空字符串或者 FALSE，则该有问题的处理器将被屏蔽。

        Note: 除了函数名，含有对象引用的数组和方法名也可以作为参数。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

For those who are having their character entities eaten by this function (e.g.
&amp; &lt; and so forth):

You will notice that your callback gets called several times.

input: Give me some beans &amp; rice. &#032;

call 1: Give me some beans
call 2: amp; and rice
call 3: #032;

There is an obvious workaround. This is not perfect:

<?php
        $text = preg_replace('/^([a-z]+;)/','&\1', $text);
        $text = preg_replace('/^(#[0-9]+;)/', '&\1', $text);
?>

re. to Philippe Marc , and  karuna_gadde examples

i found out that the xml_set_character_data_handler call back  function can be
called more often for the same element in particular the content is just a few
chars long (happen on windows)

so a check up can give you the answer an may be for long strings too.
eg:
<?php
xml_set_character_data_handler($this->parser, "cdata");
//...
function cdata($parser, $cdata) {
// ...
if(isset($this->data[$this->currentItem][$this->currentField])) {
    $this->data[$this->currentItem][$this->currentField] .= $cdata;
} else {
    $this->data[$this->currentItem][$this->currentField] = $cdata;
}     
?>
===============================================================================

To detect that concatenation of data is taking place, you can keep track of
whether the last function call was to the data processing function.
e.g. using $this->inside_data variable below:

<?php
xml_set_element_handler($this->parser, "start_tag", "end_tag");
xml_set_character_data_handler($this->parser, "contents");

protected function contents($parser, $data)
{
    switch ($this->current_tag) {
            case "name":
                if ($this->inside_data)
                    $this->name .= $data; // need to concatenate data
                else
                    $this->name = $data;
                break;
         ...
    }
    $this->inside_data = true;
}

protected function start_tag($parser, $name)
{
    $this->current_tag = $name;
    $this->inside_data = false;
}
       
protected function end_tag() {
    $this->current_tag = '';
    $this->inside_data = false;
}
?>
===============================================================================

I too love the undocumented "splitting" functionality :-p.

Rather than concatinating the data based on whether or not the current tag name
has changed from the previous tag name I suggest always concatinating like the
following with the $catData variable being unset in the endElement function:

<?php

function endElement ($parser, $data) {
  global $catData;

  // Because we are at an element end we know any splitting is finished
  unset($GLOBALS['catData']);
}

function characterData ($parser, $data) {
  global $catData;

  // Concatinate data in case splitting is taking place
  $catData.=$data;

}

?>

This got me around a problem with data like the following where, because
characterData is not called for empty tags, the previous and current tag names
were the same even though splitting was not taking place.

<companydept>
<companydeptID></companydeptID>
<companyID>1</companyID>
<companydeptName></companydeptName>
</companydept>
<companydept>
<companydeptID></companydeptID>
<companyID>2</companyID>
<companydeptName></companydeptName>
</companydept>
<companydept>
<companydeptID></companydeptID>
<companyID>3</companyID>
<companydeptName></companydeptName>
</companydept>
===============================================================================

It would be nice if someone could complete documentation of this function. I
think that the "splitting" behaviour should (at least) be mentioned within the
documentation, if not explained (please!). I'm not quite sure whether the cut
comes after each 1024bytes/chars of data.

My experience looks as follows:
[xmlFile]
...
    <label>slo| ka</label>
    <comment>koment| &#345; slo ky</comment>
...
[/xmlFile]
(Places where the character-data got splitted are marked with pipes. Plus there
was latin small letter 'r' with caron instead of &#345;.)

Since the splitting is not mentioned in documentation one could assume that it
is a bug; especially when you work with UTF-8 and the cuts come right before
some special characters.
(Should the concatenating of $cData be considered to be the proper & 'final'
way of processing character-data?)

Also I'd suggest to add another line in "Description" when fc has an alternate
usage (instead of hiding it within the "Note" :o); in this particular case I'd
prefer this:

Description:
bool xml_set_character_data_handler ( resource parser, callback handler )
bool xml_set_character_data_handler ( resource parser, object reference, method
name )

... there are dozens of functions ofcourse where documentation works this way
(I mean not mentioning the alternate usage in the "Description" part).

Have a nice day

How to overide the 1024 characters limitation of
xml_set_character_data_handler.
Took me some time to find out how to deal with that!

When calling a basic XML parser:
$parseurXML = xml_parser_create();
xml_set_element_handler($parseurXML, "opentagfunction", "closetagfunction");
xml_set_character_data_handler($parseurXML, "textfunction");

The textfunction only receive 1024 characters at once, even if the text is 4000
characters long. In facts, the parser seems to split the data in pieces of 1024
characters. The way to handle that is to concatenate them.

example:
If you have an XML tag called UNIPROT_ABSTRACT containing a 4000 characters
protein description:
function textfunction($parser, $text)
    {
     if ($last_tag_read=='UNIPROT_ABSTRACT') $uniprot.=$text;
    }
The function is called 4 times and receives 1024+1024+1024+928 characters that
will be concatenated in the $uniprot variable using the ".=" concatenation
fonction.

Easy to do, but not documented!
===============================================================================

re: jason at omegavortex dot com below, another way to deal with whitespace
issues is:

        function charData($parser,$data)
        {
            $char_data = trim($data);

            if($char_data)
                $char_data = preg_replace('/  */',' ',$data);

            $this->cdata .= $char_data;
        }

This means that:

    <p>here is my text <a href="something">my text</a>
    and here is some more after some spaces at the
    beginning of the line</p>

comes out properly. You could do further replacements if you want to deal with
tabs in your files. i only ever use spaces. if you only use trim() then you
would lose the space before the <a> tag above, but trim() is a good way to
check for completely empty char data, then just replace more than one space
with a single space. this will preserve a single space at the beginning and end
of the cdata.
===============================================================================

I don't believe the problem has been addressed, but if you're parsing an XML
file and run into the line break (or tab) problem I believe this function may
help:

if (!preg_match("/((\r|)\n)/i", $data) || preg_match("/\\t+/i", $data)) {
(Code Here)
}
===============================================================================

If you need to trim the white space for HTML code and don't rely on spaces for
formatting text (if you are then it is time to use Style Sheets) then this code
will come in very useful.

$data=eregi_replace(">"."[[:space:]]+"."<","><",$data);
$data=eregi_replace(">"."[[:space:]]+",">",$data);
$data=eregi_replace("[[:space:]]+"."<","<",$data);

Hello,

This is an addition to the note posted by:
wiart at yahoo dot com
22-Aug-2003 05:31
Which is located below.

I had similar problems manually creating XML docs and adding new-lines within
my node data, e.g.

<root>
    ...
    <node attribute="something">
        Here is some data. There is a lot of data, and I want to
        be able to read the data from a terminal window, so I add
        newlines to fit everything within 80 columns.
    </node>
    ...
</root>

So, given the above example, my data handler gets called 3 times and the result
left in my variable is:

"newlines to fit everything within 80 columns."

Instead of all of the data within "node", which I was expecting.

By using the concatenation operator; however, as suggested by the mentioned
note, I was able to get what I needed. Which is of course:

"Here is some data. There is a lot of data, and I want to be able to read the
data from a terminal window, so I add newlines to fit everything within 80
columns."
===============================================================================

I just want to mention that i ran into a problem when parsing an xml file using
the character data handler. If you happen to have a string which is also an
internal php function stored in your xml data file and you want to output it as
a string the parser dosent seem to recognize it.
   I found a way around this problem. In my case i was storing a string with
the value read. This would not allow me to output the data so to work around
this problem i added a backslash for every character in the data element.

   e.g.      <xml>
    from    <element>read</element>
    to       <element>////read</element>

i dont know if anyone has ran into this problem or not but i thought i would
just put it here just so in case someone is getting stuck with this.
===============================================================================

WARNING !!!
Always use concatenation for getting the content of a XML tag when you write
the function that will deal with the Character Data handling

Example:

$mycontent = '';
$xml_parser = xml_parser_create ();
xml_set_character_data_handler($xml_parser, "_characterdata");

function _characterdata($parser, $data){
  global $mycontent;
  //HERE: use .= and not =
  $mycontent .= $data;
}

...

while ($data = fread($fp, 4096)) {
    xml_parse($xml_parser, $data, feof($fp));
}

I had the following problem with the use of '=$data' :

In one of my XML documents, the parsing stopped in the middle of a character
data :

In original document:
<prop name="nbres">100</prop>

What happened:
<prop name="nbres">10[parsing stopped here in chunck of 4096bytes]0</prop>

As I did not use the concatenation, when I displayed the value of the 'nbres'
property, the value was 0 instead of 100 because the first time the function
characterdata was called :
$mycontent = 10;

and the second time:
$mycontent = 0;      //!!!!!!!!!!!!! HO HO !! some problem occured ...

Instead of $mycontent = 100;   

CONCLUSION:
IN YOUR CHARACTER DATA HANDLER FUNCTIONS, NEVER FORGET THE . (concatenation
operator) !!!!! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE WEIRD BUGS SOME TIMES
===============================================================================

Thanks to Christian Stocker for clearing up my entity issues,  where some
entities are parsed correctly and others not.

The problem is the ''wide'' entities that have a large numeric code simply can
not fit in a single byte, which is the default encoding for both source input
to the parser and data output from the parser.  So the parser puts out a ''?''
to say it could not store the code value. One could argue that if the input has
a &1234; the output should simply copy it as &1234; instead of the ''?'' but
that would still mean the  parser behaves two different ways according to the
code values, and anyway they don't do it.

So, we need utf8 encoding for the output, and the slightly not obvious way to
say so is

  $xml_parser = xml_parser_create ("UTF-8");

which means BOTH source input and data output are utf8.
Remember that utf8 is a superset of basic ASCII but not of extended ASCII, so
your input can contain e.g. &eacute;
spelled out, but a native eacute character is wrong here.
Just utf8_encode your input to be sure.

That should do it, and thanks again for the help.
===============================================================================

Here are two ways to deal with named entities in the XML.

1. Put a list of named entities at the front so the parser knows what they all
mean

  $decl = '<!DOCTYPE rootname [

<!ENTITY frac12  "&#x00BD;" >
<!ENTITY frac14  "&#x00BC;" >
<!ENTITY frac34  "&#x00BE;" >
<!ENTITY frac18  "&#x215B;" >
<!ENTITY frac38  "&#x215C;" >
<!ENTITY frac58  "&#x215D;" >
<!ENTITY frac78  "&#x215E;" >
<!ENTITY frac13  "&#x2153;" >
<!ENTITY frac23  "&#x2154;" >
<!ENTITY frac15  "&#x2155;" >
<!ENTITY frac25  "&#x2156;" >
<!ENTITY frac35  "&#x2157;" >
<!ENTITY frac45  "&#x2158;" >
<!ENTITY frac16  "&#x2159;" >
<!ENTITY frac56  "&#x215A;" >

<!ENTITY mdash  "&#x2014;" >

..... lots of others

<!ENTITY uuml    "&#252;" >
<!ENTITY yacute  "&#253;" >
<!ENTITY thorn   "&#254;" >
<!ENTITY yuml    "&#255;" >

]>';

$parseThis = $decl . "<rootname> ..... </rootname>";

This works fine for all the single-byte (European) codes,
but not the wide codes like emdash or frac18.
They seem to be trashed when the character data handler gets them.  They all
echo as "?"

There may be a way to make them work, but until I find it,
or a newer release takes care of it, here is a work-around that does work.

2. Rewrite every ampersand as &amp; in the input stream

$ampXML = str_replace ("&", "&amp;", $sourceXML);

Now the parser will see &amp;foo; instead of &foo;

It does not try to decode it, so wide (two byte) values are not a problem, and
no list of names is needed.

When you write that to your output you have &foo;

which is usually fine for the next stage of your process.
===============================================================================

In some cases it's better to avoid storing data which is not needed. In these
cases the function

chop()  ( => Alias of function rtrim() )

could be usefull to prevent data like

"\t"
"\r"
"\o"
"\n"
"\x0B"
" "

to be stored in a array or a string or something like this.

Example: (storing data in a string)
________________
$filename="xyz.xml";

if(!($fp=fopen($filename,"r"))){
   die("Cannot open $filename ");
}

while (!feof($fp))
{
   $data .= chop(fgets($fp, 4096));
}

fclose($fp);

Have a look at the documentation of rtrim() http://www.php.net/manual/en/
function.rtrim.php.

Here's a way to strip all the spaces between tags in an xml document.

//strip white space between tags
$data=eregi_replace(">"."[[:space:]]+"."<","><",$data);

So this:

<house>
  <garage>
    <car>Waldo</car>
  </garage>
</house>

would be changed to:

<house><garage><car>Waldo</car></garage></house>

It was useful to me. Maybe you too?
===============================================================================

the function handler is called several times when it parses the character
data.  It doesn't return the entire string as it suggests.  There are special
exceptions that will always force the parser to stop scanning and call the
character data handler.  This is when:

- The parser runs into an Entity Declaration, such as &amp; (&) or &apos; ( )
- The parser finishes parsing an entity
- The parser runs into the new-line character (\n)
- The parser runs into a series of tab characters (\t)

And perhaps others.

For instance, if we have this xml content:

<mytag name= Ken Egervari  title= Chief Technology Officer >
    Ken has been Positive Edge&apos;s Chief Technology Officer for 2 years.
</mytag>

The parser will call the character data handler 6 times.  This is what will
happen:

1    \n
2    \t
3    Ken has been Positive Edge
4     
5    s Chief Technology Officer for 2 years.
6    \n

I hope that helps people out.
===============================================================================

If you want to strip unwanted whitespace in an HTML-like manner then there are
two steps.

The first you need to strip consecutive whitespaces from all you input data
like this:  $data = eregi_replace ( "[[:space:]]+", " ", $data );

Then in your cdata handler make a check to see if it's blank space. An easy way
is like this: if ( trim ( $cdata ) ) { work on cdata }

That should take care of any whitespace issues you might have.
===============================================================================

The maximum size of the second parmeter $data seems to be 1024. Is there more
character data  in the XML text the handler is called again immediately with
the next portion.
===============================================================================

That give an example about the note.
When you are creating a class and you need to use a method of your class to the
function xml_set_character_data_handler that is the way to point give the
method:

class example
{
   function example()
   {
   }

  function data($parseur, $texte)
  {
      switch ($this->derniereBaliseRencontree)
      {
         case "TITLE":
                     -----
          break;
         case "LINK"
                    -----
         break;
        case "DESCRIPTION":
                    -----
        break;
     }
  }

  function fetchOpen($parseur, $nomBalise, $tableauAttributs)
  {
     ----------------
  }

  function fetchClose($parseur, $nomBalise)
  {
     ----------------
  }

  function ZZZ()
  {
      $parseurXML = xml_parser_create();
       xml_set_element_handler($parseurXML, Array(&$this, 'fetchOpen'),   Array
(&$this, 'fetchClose'));
         ---------------- <IMPORTANT> --------------------------
       xml_set_character_data_handler($parseurXML, Array(&$this, 'data'));
        ---------------- </IMPORTANT> --------------------------
}

ingres_field_type — Get the type of a field in a query result

说明

string ingres_field_type ( resource $result , int $index )

Get the type of a field in a query result.

    Note: Related Configurations

    See ingres.array_index_start in Runtime Configuration

参数

result

    The query result identifier

index

    index is the field whose type will be retrieved.

    The possible values of index depend upon the value of
    ingres.array_index_start. If ingres.array_index_start is 1 (the default)
    then index must be between 1 and the value returned by ingres_num_fields().
    If ingres.array_index_start is 0 then index must be between 0 and 
    ingres_num_fields() - 1.

返回值

ingres_field_type() returns the type of a field in a query result 或者在失败时
返回 FALSE. Examples of types returned are IIAPI_BYTE_TYPE, IIAPI_CHA_TYPE,
IIAPI_DTE_TYPE, IIAPI_FLT_TYPE, IIAPI_INT_TYPE, IIAPI_VCH_TYPE. Some of these
types can map to more than one SQL type depending on the length of the field
(see ingres_field_length()). For example IIAPI_FLT_TYPE can be a float4 or a
float8. For detailed information, see the Ingres OpenAPI User Guide, Appendix
"Data Types" in the Ingres documentation.

I have to apologise for the previous two long postings, but information
referring to the INGRES data types is a bit hard to find, so I want to share
it. Below is my translation script for INGRES->MySQL data types.

<?
// Fieldtype Translator  INGRES => MySQL (c) F.Burckhardt
// translates string, int, date; might be incomplete with respect to other
INGRES data-types
$sql="SELECT * FROM table";
$conn = ingres_connect ($database, $user, $password);
$results = ingres_query($sql,$conn);
$fieldtype = array ( "key" => "val");
$ingres_translation = array( "IIAPI_VCH_TYPE" => "string",
                              "IIAPI_CHA_TYPE" => "string",
                              "IIAPI_INT_TYPE" => "int",
                              "IIAPI_DTE_TYPE" => "date");
for($i=1; $i<ingres_num_fields($conn)+1; $i++) {
   $fieldtype [ingres_field_name($i,$conn)] = $ingres_translation
[ingres_field_type($i,$conn)];
   echo ("field_name (".ingres_field_name($i,$conn).") field_type (INGRES):
".ingres_field_type($i,$conn)." => fieldtype (MySQL)".$ingres_translation
[ingres_field_type($i,$conn)]." <br>");
        }

IIAPI_LOGKEY_TYPE A data type with values that are unique within the data
source. An application should not attempt to update a column containing a
system-maintained object key.

IIAPI_LBYTE_TYPE A variable-length binary string. The actual length of the
large byte segment is stored in the first two bytes of the data buffer,
followed by the large byte data. Length: 0 to 2,000,000,000 characters.

IIAPI_LVCH_TYPE A variable-length character string. The actual length of the
large varchar segment is stored in the first two bytes of the data buffer,
followed by the large varchar data. Valid characters for this data type include
printing, non-printing, and NULL characters. Trailing blanks are insignificant
in a varchar data type. Length: 0 to 2,000,000,000 characters.

IIAPI_MNY_TYPE The Ingres money data type stored in 8 bytes with 2 fixed
decimal places.  IIAPI_convertData() or  IIAPI_formatData() can be used to
convert to character string or floating point representation.

IIAPI_TABKEY_TYPE A data type with a value that is unique within the table
where the table key is stored. An application should not attempt to update a
column containing a systemmaintained table key.

IIAPI_TXT_TYPE A variable-length character string. The maximum size for this
data type is stored as the ds_length parameter in the corresponding descriptor.
The actual length of the text data is stored in the first two bytes of the data
buffer, followed by the text data. Valid characters for this data type include
printing and non-printing characters. All blanks are significant in a text data
buffer. This type is supported for previous Ingres versions; when possible,
use  IIAPI_VCH_TYPE. Length: 1 to 2,000 characters.

IIAPI_VBYTE_TYPE A variable-length binary string. The maximum size for varbyte
data is stored as the ds_length parameter in the corresponding descriptor. The
actual length of the varbyte data is stored in the first two bytes of the data
buffer, followed by the varbyte data. Length: 0 to 2,000 characters.

IIAPI_VCH_TYPE A variable-length character string. The maximum size for varchar
data is stored as the ds_length parameter in the corresponding descriptor. The
actual length of the varchar data is stored in the first two bytes of the data
buffer, followed by the varchar data. Trailing blanks are insignificant in a
varchar data type. Length: 0 to 2,000 characters.

Ingres Data Types (oapi.pdf open api user guide)
Data Type Descriptions Ingres data types are described in the following table:
Data Type Description
IIAPI_BYTE_TYPE A fixed length binary string containing data with the declared
length. The declared length is stored as the ds_length parameter in the
corresponding data descriptor. Length: 1 to 2,000 characters.

IIAPI_CHA_TYPE A fixed length character string that is stored blankpadded to
the declared length. The declared length is stored as the ds_length parameter
in the corresponding data descriptor. Embedded blanks are significant. Valid
characters for this data type include printing, nonprinting, and NULL
characters. Length: 1 to 2,000 characters.

IIAPI_CHR_TYPE A fixed length character string that is stored blankpadded to
the declared length. The declared length is stored as the ds_length parameter
in the corresponding data descriptor. Embedded blanks are insignificant. Valid
characters for this data type include printing characters only. This data type
is supported for previous Ingres versions; when possible, use IIAPI_CHA_TYPE.
Length: 1 to 2,000 characters.

IIAPI_HNDL_TYPE A data type used only by OpenAPI and the application. This data
type describes a handle, which is a pointer to one of the control blocks
created by OpenAPI. OpenAPI translates the information in the control block
into data acceptable by the data source. This data type does not appear in
queries.

IIAPI_DEC_TYPE A packed decimal data type stored in 1 to 16 bytes depending on
the precision of the value as follows: len = (precision)/2 + 1.
IIAPI_convertData() or  IIAPI_formatData() may be used to convert to character
string or floating point representation.

IIAPI_DTE_TYPE Ingres internal date data type that is stored in 12 bytes.
IIAPI_convertData() or IIAPI_formatData() may be used to convert to character
string or floating point representation.

IIAPI_FLT_TYPE A data type supporting data value ranges from - 1.0e+38 to
+1.0e+38.

IIAPI_INT_TYPE A data type supporting varying data value ranges. It is
dependent on the ds_length of the data value. If the length is 1, the range is
from -128 to +127. If the length is 2, the range is from -32,768 to +32,767. If
the length is 4, the range is from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

QuickHashStringIntHash::loadFromFile — This factory method creates a hash from
a file

说明

public static QuickHashStringIntHash QuickHashStringIntHash::loadFromFile ( 
string $filename [, int $size = 0 [, int $options = 0 ]] )

This factory method creates a new hash from a definition file on disk. The file
format consists of a signature 'QH\0x21\0', the number of elements as a 32 bit
signed integer in system Endianness, an unsigned 32 bit integer containing the
number of element data to follow in characters. This element data contains all
the strings. The follows another signed 32 bit integer containing the number of
bucket lists. After the header and the strings, the elements follow. They are
ordered by bucket list so that the keys don't have to be hashed in order to
restore the hash. For each bucket list, the following information is stored
(all as 32 bit integers): the bucket list index, the number of elements in that
list, and then in pairs of two unsigned 32 bit integers the elements, where the
first one is the index into the string list containing the keys, and the second
one the value. An example could be:

Example #1 QuickHash StringIntHash file format

00000000  51 48 21 00 02 00 00 00  09 00 00 00 40 00 00 00  |QH!.........@...|
00000010  4f 4e 45 00 4e 49 4e 45  00 07 00 00 00 01 00 00  |ONE.NINE........|
00000020  00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00  00 2f 00 00 00 01 00 00  |........./......|
00000030  00 04 00 00 00 03 00 00  00                       |.........|

Example #2 QuickHash IntHash file format

header signature ('QH'; key type: 2; value type: 1; filler: \0x00)
00000000  51 48 21 00

number of elements:
00000004  02 00 00 00

length of string values (9 characters):
00000008  09 00 00 00

number of hash bucket lists (this is configured for hashes as argument to the
constructor normally, 64 in this case):
0000000C  40 00 00 00

string values:
00000010  4f 4e 45 00 4e 49 4e 45  00

bucket lists:
  bucket list 1 (with key 7, and 1 element):
    header:
    07 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
    elements (key index: 0 ('ONE'), value = 0):
    00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
  bucket list 2 (with key 0x2f, and 1 element):
    header:
    2f 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
    elements (key index: 4 ('NINE'), value = 3):
    04 00 00 00 03 00 00 00

参数

filename

    The filename of the file to read the hash from.

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 4 to 4194304.

options

    The same options that the class' constructor takes; except that the size
    option is ignored. It is read from the file format (unlike the
    QuickHashIntHash and QuickHashIntStringHash classes, where it is
    automatically calculated from the number of entries in the hash.)

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashStringIntHash.

范例

Example #3 QuickHashStringIntHash::loadFromFile() example

<?php
$file = dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.hash.string";
$hash = QuickHashStringIntHash::loadFromFile(
    $file,
    QuickHashStringIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC
);
foreach( range( 0, 0x0f ) as $key )
{
    $i = 48712 + $key * 1631;
    $k = base_convert( $i, 10, 36 );
    echo $k, ' => ', $hash->get( $k ), "\n";
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

11l4 => 48712
12uf => 50343
143q => 51974

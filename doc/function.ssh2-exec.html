There doesn't appear to be a way to get data from BOTH stderr and stdout
streams simultaneously, or at least I've yet to find one.

The following code *should* get the error message written to stderr, but if the
call to stream_get_contents() for stdout is run first, the subsequent call for
stderr won't return anything. 

If the order of the statements is reversed, the call for stderr will return any
errors and call for stdout will return nothing

<?php
// Run a command that will probably write to stderr (unless you have a folder
named /hom)
$stream = ssh2_exec($connection, "cd /hom");
$errorStream = ssh2_fetch_stream($stream, SSH2_STREAM_STDERR);

// Enable blocking for both streams
stream_set_blocking($errorStream, true);
stream_set_blocking($stream, true);

// Whichever of the two below commands is listed first will receive its
appropriate output.  The second command receives nothing
echo "Output: " . stream_get_contents($stream);
echo "Error: " . stream_get_contents($errorStream);

// Close the streams       
fclose($errorStream);
fclose($stream);

?>

My initial suspicion is that either a) I've done something wrong  or b) the
blocking nature of both streams means that by the time first stream has
received data and returned, the buffer for the second stream has already
emptied.

I've done preliminary tests with blocking disabled, but haven't had any luck
there either.
===============================================================================

if you are using exec function, and have problems with a output > 1000 lines
you should use 

<?php
                stream_set_blocking($stream, true);
                while($line = fgets($stream)) {
                        flush();
                        echo $line."<br />";
                }
?>

except

<?php
                stream_set_blocking($stream, true);
               echo stream_get_contents($stream);
?>
===============================================================================

The "pty" parameter is not documented.

You should pass a pty emulation name ("vt102", "ansi", etc...) if you want to
emulate a pty, or NULL if you don't.

Passing false will convert false to a string, and will allocate a "" terminal.
===============================================================================

I believe most of the problem that people are having here is that there is a
misconception about what blocking *really* means.

Blocking means a read from the *stream* will wait until there is data.  Not
necessarily all the data from the application -- but *some*.  So it won't help
you at all if you're executing a command that doesn't write to stdout, or
writes a whole lot of data.

So there are 2 problems:

1. If you need to know that a silent program is done via ssh2_exec, you'll need
to signal it to yourself.  ssh2_exec will *not* block execution until the
command is done executing.  And 2 consecutive ssh2_execs may execute
asynchronously.  You could also log into a shell via ssh2_shell and parse up to
the next prompt -- but that's overkill.  You can also do this by adding on some
sort of sentinel at the end of your command, such as echo "@," and then block
on reads until you see a "@."  Ensure "@" won't appear in the output, or escape
the output via some encoding mechanism if you can't do that.

2. If the program takes awhile, you have the same problem.  You need to read
until you're done.  So you need a sentinel value like the above.

3. Sleep() is just a bad idea here.  Commands rarely take the same amount of
time to execute a command twice.  It may be OK if you're doing *one* thing and
can just wait 5 seconds.  But that's not cool if it's something you're doing in
a loop.

Hope this helps!
===============================================================================

If you want to run many exec orders throught ssh2 in the same process using the
same variable $stream for exemple and to read the output for each order, you
must close the stream after each order else you will not be able to read the
next order output.

<?php
$stream=ssh2_exec($conn_id,"/usr/bin/ls .");
    stream_set_blocking( $stream, true );
    $cmd=fread($stream,4096);
fclose($stream);

if(ereg("public_html",$cmd)){
// ...........................................
}

$stream=ssh2_exec($conn_id,"/usr/bin/ls public_html");
    stream_set_blocking( $stream, true );
    $cmd=fread($stream,4096);
fclose($stream);

if(ereg("images",$cmd)){
// ..........................................
}


$stream=ssh2_exec($conn_id,"/usr/bin/ls public_html/images");
    stream_set_blocking( $stream, true );
    $cmd=fread($stream,4096);
fclose($stream);

if(ereg("blabla",$cmd)){
// ..........................................
}
?>
===============================================================================

If the ssh2_exec takes awhile to run, and you need a handshake, you can use a
file.  In this case, $flag names a handshake file that is written when the ssh
script finishes.

<?php
                $stream = ssh2_exec($connection, $command . " $public_key 
$private_key;");
                $i=0;
                while (!file_exists ($flag) && ($i < MAX_TIME))
                {
                        sleep(1);
                        $i++;
                }
                $ret_val=($stream!=FALSE);
?>

This is an extract out of the bash script that is running.  Be sure to allow
the webserver permission to read the file that the script writes.

echo 0 > $OUTFILE
chmod 666 $OUTFILE

One other note:  you can put more than one command in by separating them with
';' (semicolons).
===============================================================================

This is the best way I found to automatically run multiple commands or commands
that might take longer then expected.  NOTE: this assumes that no where in the
output is there the text '[end]' otherwise the function will end prematurely. 
Hope this helps people.

<?php
$ip = 'ip_address';
$user = 'username';
$pass = 'password';

$connection = ssh2_connect($ip);
ssh2_auth_password($connection,$user,$pass);
$shell = ssh2_shell($connection,"bash");

//Trick is in the start and end echos which can be executed in both *nix and
windows systems.
//Do add 'cmd /C' to the start of $cmd if on a windows system.
$cmd = "echo '[start]';your commands here;echo '[end]'";
$output = user_exec($shell,$cmd);

fclose($shell);

function user_exec($shell,$cmd) {
  fwrite($shell,$cmd . "\n");
  $output = "";
  $start = false;
  $start_time = time();
  $max_time = 2; //time in seconds
  while(((time()-$start_time) < $max_time)) {
    $line = fgets($shell);
    if(!strstr($line,$cmd)) {
      if(preg_match('/\[start\]/',$line)) {
        $start = true;
      }elseif(preg_match('/\[end\]/',$line)) {
        return $output;
      }elseif($start){
        $output[] = $line;
      }
    }
  }
}

?>

Executing remote Windows commands...
After some hair pulling, I thought I'd suggest a couple things that might help
others:

1. Use 'ssh2_fetch_stream' to open a stderr stream according to the manual.
2. Windows shell commands require 'cmd /C [command]' to execute.  (I had
forgotten this)

<?php
    // code fragment
    $stdout_stream = ssh2_exec($connection, 'cmd /C dir');
    $stderr_stream = ssh2_fetch_stream($stdout_stream, SSH2_STREAM_STDERR);
?>

I didn't realize the need for the 'cmd /C' until I saw the stderr response
'dir: not found'.
===============================================================================

It is also good to use register_shutdown_function to shred the keys after this
runs.
===============================================================================

The command  may not finish before the function return if the stream is not set
to blocking mode. You may have to set the stream to blocking mode in order to
get any output from the command.

<?php
  // [Open connection]
  // ...

  $stream = ssh2_exec($connection, 'ps ax');
  stream_set_blocking($stream, true);
 
  // The command may not finish properly if the stream is not read to end
  $output = stream_get_contents($stream);
 
  // ...
  // [Close stream and connection]
?>
===============================================================================

<?php
$connection = ssh2_connect('shell.example.com', 22);
ssh2_auth_password($connection, 'username', 'password');

$stream = ssh2_exec($connection, '/usr/local/bin/php -i');
?>
===============================================================================

It is important to note that this will not work ~all~ hosts that allow SFTP. We
deny shell access, but allow SFTP using the sftp-internal subsystem.

When attempting to use ssh2_exec() with this configuration, and
stream_set_blocking set to true, the script will hang indefinitely. When
stream_set_blocking is set to false, nothing will be returned.

Even if you can SFTP files, be sure to check with your host to see if you have
shell access.
===============================================================================

Oddly enough, I've noticed if I attempt to execute anything nothing happens.
Now, I don't mean "No content is returned!".. I mean, "The command I told it to
execute didn't execute!".

Unless the following pattern is followed:

<?php
$stream = ssh2_exec($connection, "touch ~/some_fake_file", 'xterm');
stream_get_contents($stream);
?>

Nowhere in the manual does it imply that stream_get_contents is required for
the actual execution to take place, but in this case.. it seems that way. So,
if you're having trouble getting commands to execute, try using
stream_get_contents().
===============================================================================

*** IMPORTANT ***
If you are having issues getting STDERR on PHP 5.2.X, make sure to update to
5.2.17 and latest ssh2 extension from PECL.

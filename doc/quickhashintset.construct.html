(PECL quickhash >= Unknown)

QuickHashIntSet::__construct — Creates a new QuickHashIntSet object

说明

public QuickHashIntSet::__construct ( int $size [, int $options ] )

This constructor creates a new QuickHashIntSet. The size is the amount of
bucket lists to create. The more lists there are, the less collisions you will
have. Options are also supported.

参数

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 4 to 4194304.

options

    The options that you can pass in are: QuickHashIntSet::CHECK_FOR_DUPES,
    which makes sure no duplicate entries are added to the set;
    QuickHashIntSet::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC to not use PHP's internal memory
    manager as well as one of QuickHashIntSet::HASHER_NO_HASH,
    QuickHashIntSet::HASHER_JENKINS1 or QuickHashIntSet::HASHER_JENKINS2. These
    last three configure which hashing algorithm to use. All options can be
    combined using bitmasks.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntSet object.

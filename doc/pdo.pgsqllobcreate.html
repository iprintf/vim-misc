PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate — Creates a new large object

说明

public string PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate ( void )

PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate() creates a large object and returns the OID of that
object. You may then open a stream on the object using PDO::pgsqlLOBOpen() to
read or write data to it. The OID can be stored in columns of type OID and be
used to reference the large object, without causing the row to grow arbitrarily
large. The large object will continue to live in the database until it is
removed by calling PDO::pgsqlLOBUnlink().

Large objects can be up to 2GB in size, but are cumbersome to use; you need to
ensure that PDO::pgsqlLOBUnlink() is called prior to deleting the last row that
references its OID from your database. In addition, large objects have no
access controls. As an alternative, try the bytea column type; recent versions
of PostgreSQL allow bytea columns of up to 1GB in size and transparently manage
the storage for optimal row size.

    Note: This function must be called within a transaction.

参数

PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate() takes no parameters.

返回值

Returns the OID of the newly created large object on success, or FALSE on
failure.

范例

Example #1 A PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate() example

This example creates a new large object and copies the contents of a file into
it. The OID is then stored into a table.

<?php
$db = new PDO('pgsql:dbname=test host=localhost', $user, $pass);
$db->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
$db->beginTransaction();
$oid = $db->pgsqlLOBCreate();
$stream = $db->pgsqlLOBOpen($oid, 'w');
$local = fopen($filename, 'rb');
stream_copy_to_stream($local, $stream);
$local = null;
$stream = null;
$stmt = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO BLOBS (ident, oid) VALUES (?, ?)");
$stmt->execute(array($some_id, $oid));
$db->commit();
?>

===============================================================================

IMHO, there's a better way to handle the deletion of lob objects than the
suggested here. The programmer can easily forget to unlink the lob. With the
following trigger, no programmer actions are required.
By the way, one problem with bytea fields is that when you query the database,
if you ask for that field, the data is actually retrieved. When you query for
and oid, only the oid is retrieved and then you can open the lob whenever you
want (if it's required).

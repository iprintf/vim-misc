(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sem_acquire — Acquire a semaphore

说明

bool sem_acquire ( resource $sem_identifier [, bool $nowait = false ] )

sem_acquire() by default blocks (if necessary) until the semaphore can be
acquired. A process attempting to acquire a semaphore which it has already
acquired will block forever if acquiring the semaphore would cause its maximum
number of semaphore to be exceeded.

After processing a request, any semaphores acquired by the process but not
explicitly released will be released automatically and a warning will be
generated.

参数

sem_identifier

    sem_identifier is a semaphore resource, obtained from sem_get().

nowait

    Specifies if the process shouldn't wait for the semaphore to be acquired.
    If set to true, the call will return false immediately if a semaphore
    cannot be immediately acquired.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                说明
5.6.1 The $nowait parameter was added.

===============================================================================

sem_acquire() is blocking, meaning that subsequent calls with the same
semaphore will block indefinitely until the semaphore is released. This ensures
serialization, but it is not very practical if all you want to do is check if
you should proceed or not. Unfortunately, PHP does not yet support any method
of querying the state of a semaphore in a non-blocking manner.

It may seem possible to put together such a mechanism by hand, using shared
memory (shm_ functions). However, be warned that it is not trivial and
ultimately non-productive. You cannot, for example, simply pick a shared mem
var, store the semaphore key and query it. Such an operation would be
non-transactional and non-atomic ie. it is possible for two or more parallel
processes to manage to read "not locked" from the shared mem var before one of
them manages to mark it "locked". You would have to use a (blocking) semaphore
to serialize access to the shared mem var, thus recreating the very problem you
are trying to solve.

In other words, if non-blocking queries are crucial to you, you need to either
request that this issue be solved by the PHP designers, or pick another
mechanism to do your locking, one that already has this feature.
===============================================================================

Just to clarify what is meant by "process" above:

On the Apache webserver, many PHP requests will be executed within the same
process space because it is multithreaded. However, any semaphores got and
acquired by a script and not released and removed will still be automatically
cleaned up by the PHP interpreter each time the script terminates.

Remove any trash before emailing!
===============================================================================

Note that when you reset $sem_identifier the semaphore won't block anymore!

This code does NOT work:
    $key     = ftok(__FILE__,'m');
    $a        = sem_get($key);
    sem_acquire($a);
    $a = false;

while this one does:

    $key     = ftok(__FILE__,'m');
    $a        = sem_get($key);
    sem_acquire($a);
    //$a = false;

So: use unique var names for your identifier!
===============================================================================

In my tests sem_acquire() is 150 times faster than flock()
===============================================================================

If you need non-blocking semaphores, here is an example how you may implement
it. Use a shared memory variable to mark whether or not a lock exists and then
use a semaphore around operations against that variable. I'll call my shared
variable as 'token'.

<?php
echo '<pre>';

$resourceSemaphore = sem_get(7);
$tokenSemaphore = sem_get(8);
$tokenValue = shm_attach(9, 100);

function myEcho($v) {
    echo microtime() . ' ' . $v . "\n";
}

// sem_remove($resourceSemaphore);
// sem_remove($tokenSemaphore);
// exit();

function try_lock() {
    global $resourceSemaphore, $tokenSemaphore, $tokenValue;
    myEcho('begin try_lock()');
    myEcho('acquire token semaphore');
    sem_acquire($tokenSemaphore);
    myEcho('    token semaphore acquired');
    $tmp = shm_get_var($tokenValue, 6);
    myEcho('    token value: ' . var_export($tmp, true));
    $exit = $tmp;
    if (!$exit) {
        $tmp = shm_put_var($tokenValue, 6, true);
        $tmp = shm_get_var($tokenValue, 6);
        myEcho('    token new value: ' . var_export($tmp, true));
    }
    myEcho('release token semaphore');
    sem_release($tokenSemaphore);
    if ($exit) return false;
    myEcho('acquire resource semaphore');
    sem_acquire($resourceSemaphore);
    myEcho('    resource semaphore acquired');
    return true;
}

function release() {
    global $resourceSemaphore, $tokenSemaphore, $tokenValue;
    myEcho('release resource semaphore');
    sem_release($resourceSemaphore);
    myEcho('acquire token semaphore');
    sem_acquire($tokenSemaphore);
    myEcho('    token semaphore acquired');
    $tmp = shm_get_var($tokenValue, 6);
    myEcho('    token value: ' . var_export($tmp, true));
    $tmp = shm_put_var($tokenValue, 6, false);
    $tmp = shm_get_var($tokenValue, 6);
    myEcho('    token new value: ' . var_export($tmp, true));
    myEcho('release token semaphore');
    sem_release($tokenSemaphore);
}

for ($triesLeft = 5; $triesLeft > 0 && !try_lock(); $triesLeft--) {
    myEcho('failed to acquire resource');
    myEcho('wait for 1 sec');
    sleep(1);
    myEcho('try again');
}
myEcho('    access the resource for 4 sec');
//paste here your code, accessing your resource
sleep(4);
release();
myEcho('the end');
?>
When I execute this script in two parallel instances, I get the following
output:

... 486     token semaphore acquired
... 486     token value: true
... 486     token new value: false
... 486 release token semaphore
... 486 the end
-------(second instance)----------------------------------------

Unfortunately, PHP does not currently support non-blocking semaphores.

If something like this is necessary you can utilize semaphores together with
shared memory to create your own non-blocking lock mechanisms.

Use a shared memory variable to mark whether or not a lock exists and then use
a semaphore around operations against that variable.

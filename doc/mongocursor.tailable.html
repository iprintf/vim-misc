MongoCursor::tailable

(PECL mongo >=0.9.4)

MongoCursor::tailable — Sets whether this cursor will be left open after
fetching the last results

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::tailable ([ bool $tail = true ] )

Mongo has a feature known as tailable cursors which are similar to the Unix
"tail -f" command.

Tailable means cursor is not closed when the last data is retrieved. Rather,
the cursor marks the final object's position. you can resume using the cursor
later, from where it was located, if more data were received.

Like any "latent cursor", the cursor may become invalid at some point -- for
example if that final object it references were deleted. Thus, you should be
prepared to requery if the cursor is MongoCursor::dead().

参数

tail

    If the cursor should be tailable.

返回值

Returns this cursor.

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if this cursor has started iterating.

范例

Example #1 MongoCursor::tailable() example

<?php

$cursor = $collection->find()->tailable();

$results = array();

while (1) {
    if (!$cursor->hasNext()) {
        // we've read all the results, exit
        if ($cursor->dead()) {
            break;
        }
        // read all results so far, wait for more
        sleep(10);
    }
    else {
        $results[] = $cursor->getNext();
    }
}

?>

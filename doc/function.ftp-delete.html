You can make a script delete itself with ftp_delete!

It's pretty useful when creating an install script which you want to destroy at
the end of the installation to prevent it from being run later.

On Linux machines, very often the user uploads third party scripts, and gets
asked to CHMOD this and delete that manually because the webserver user is
different from the FTP user ; make them enter their FTP info and get rid of the
tedious file manipulation step!

Be careful, though. You will need to flush the output buffer and call
ftp_delete at the end of the script, or else the script will die before it
fully executes. Look up ob_end_flush for more info.

if you want to upload the file on server and thn do delete it.. this script
works well

<?php
// connect and login data
$web = '111.111.111.111';
$user = '123abc';
$pass = 'abc123';
// file location
$server_file = '/public_html/upload/test.csv';
$local_file = 'test.csv';
//connect
$conn_id = ftp_connect($web);
$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id,$user,$pass);
//uploading
if (ftp_put($conn_id, $server_file, $local_file, FTP_BINARY))
{echo "Success \n";}
else {echo "Failed";}

// try to delete $file
if (ftp_delete($conn_id, $server_file)) {
echo "$server_file deleted successful\n";
} else {
echo "could not delete $server_file\n";
}

// close the connection
ftp_close($conn_id);
?>

Generally speaking, unlink will work just fine for most applications, however,
if you are using multiple servers, you're going to have to connect to the other
server using FTP.

This works perfectly!

<?php
$file = 'public_html/plentyport.com/jobs/employee/resumes/4216:54:38Resume
(1).docx';
$ftp_server="your server address";
// set up basic connection
$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);
$ftp_user_name="your user server name";
$ftp_user_pass="your server password";
// login with username and password
$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);

// try to delete $file
if (ftp_delete($conn_id, $file)) {
echo "$file deleted successful\n";
} else {
echo "could not delete $file\n";
}

// close the connection
ftp_close($conn_id);
?>
===============================================================================

you can delete a file with a normal unlink function in the php api

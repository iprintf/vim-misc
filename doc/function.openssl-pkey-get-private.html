===============================================================================

Please note that "file://path/to/file.pem" in documentation means file protocol
+ file path. In UNIX like OS, that is something like file:///
rsa_private_key.pem. There is THREE slashes in the path string, not TWO.
===============================================================================

It's actually "file://key.pem" when you want to give a relative path using unix
systems. It will be three '/' in case of absolute path (e.g "file:///home/
username/..."). But this path consists of two '/' originated from "file://" and
one '/' from the fact that home is a subfolder of the unix filesystem's root
directory ("/home/username/..."). This two part will be concatenated and you
will get three '/' characters following each other.

So you only have to concatenate "file://" with an existing path string in every
case.

openssl_pkcs7_verify — Verifies the signature of an S/MIME signed message

说明

mixed openssl_pkcs7_verify ( string $filename , int $flags [, string
$outfilename [, array $cainfo [, string $extracerts [, string $content ]]]] )

openssl_pkcs7_verify() reads the S/MIME message contained in the given file and
examines the digital signature.

参数

filename

    Path to the message.

flags

    flags can be used to affect how the signature is verified - see PKCS7
    constants for more information.

outfilename

    If the outfilename is specified, it should be a string holding the name of
    a file into which the certificates of the persons that signed the messages
    will be stored in PEM format.

cainfo

    If the cainfo is specified, it should hold information about the trusted CA
    certificates to use in the verification process - see certificate
    verification for more information about this parameter.

extracerts

    If the extracerts is specified, it is the filename of a file containing a
    bunch of certificates to use as untrusted CAs.

content

    You can specify a filename with content that will be filled with the
    verified data, but with the signature information stripped.

返回值

Returns TRUE if the signature is verified, FALSE if it is not correct (the
message has been tampered with, or the signing certificate is invalid), or -1
on error.

更新日志

版本                说明
5.1.0 The content parameter was added.

注释

    Note: As specified in RFC 2045, lines may not be longer than 76 characters
    in the filename parameter.

===============================================================================

To read signed message in base64 (not encrypted with priv&pub key):

You can just decode content by "base64_decode" or "imap_base64" functions and
then erase by hand(regexp) sign from bottom of mail. Unfortunately  in my case
(mail from Outlook) that  message (decoded by "base64_decode") has some
additional special chars in some places (ie. before every attachment encoded
base_64) what make message e-mail unable to parse.

After couple of hours I solved this:
It's needed to save single e-mail and use 2x "openssl_pkcs7_verify" function in
row on original email (with headers and content in base64 ):
  1st use - extract sign (certificate) from e-mail and save to file *.cert
  2nd use - extract (with use that *.cert file) decoded message to  file*.out

Code:
  $handle  =  imap_open('mailbox.eml', '', '');

  $msg = 'home/john/tmp/email1.eml';
  imap_savebody($handle, $msg,  1);

  openssl_pkcs7_verify($msg, 0, $msg . '.cert');
  openssl_pkcs7_verify($msg, 0, $msg . '.cert', array(), $msg . '.cert',
$msg.'.out');

  $email_content = file_get_contents($msg . '.out');

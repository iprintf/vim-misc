Phar::running

(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 2.0.0)

Phar::running — Returns the full path on disk or full phar URL to the currently
executing Phar archive

说明

final public static string Phar::running ([ bool $retphar = true ] )

Returns the full path to the running phar archive. This is intended for use
much like the __FILE__ magic constant, and only has effect inside an executing
phar archive.

Inside the stub of an archive, Phar::running() returns "". Simply use __FILE__
to access the current running phar inside a stub.

参数

retphar

    If FALSE, the full path on disk to the phar archive is returned. If TRUE, a
    full phar URL is returned.

返回值

Returns the filename if valid, empty string otherwise.

范例

Example #1 A Phar::running() example

For the following example, assume the phar archive is located at /path/to/phar/
my.phar.

<?php
$a = Phar::running(); // $a is "phar:///path/to/my.phar"
$b = Phar::running(false); // $b is "/path/to/my.phar"
?>

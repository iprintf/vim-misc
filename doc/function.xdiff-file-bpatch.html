xdiff_file_bpatch — Patch a file with a binary diff

说明

bool xdiff_file_bpatch ( string $file , string $patch , string $dest )

Patches a file with a binary patch and stores the result in a file dest. This
function accepts patches created both via xdiff_file_bdiff() and 
xdiff_file_rabdiff() functions or their string counterparts.

参数

file

    The original file.

patch

    The binary patch file.

dest

    Path of the resulting file.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 xdiff_file_bpatch() example

The following code applies binary diff to a file.

<?php
$old_version = 'archive-1.0.tgz';
$patch = 'archive.bpatch';

$result = xdiff_file_bpatch($old_version, $patch, 'archive-1.1.tgz');
if ($result) {
   echo "File patched";
} else {
   echo "File couldn't be patched";
}

?>

注释

    Note:

    Both files (file and patch) will be loaded into memory so ensure that your
    memory_limit is set high enough.

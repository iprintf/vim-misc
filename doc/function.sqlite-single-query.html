The previous note by franp at free dot fr appears to be incorrect, some cursory
testing showed that DELETE FROM and INSERT INTO queries worked fine so other
queries which do not return data should also work. However, if you're looking
for a drop in replacement for sqlite_query(), try sqlite_unbuffered_query() as
it appears to only execute the first query if more than one is given.
===============================================================================

AFAIK, you cannot use sqlite-single-query for all kind of SQL queries.
If you are lazy and thought you could safely copy-paste your :
<?php $result = $db->sqlite-single-query($sSQL); ?>
straight from one query to the other, whatever is the query as long as it has
only one line, you are wrong.

Apparently, sqlite-single-query is limited to queries that return data, that is
to SELECT queries.

<?php
$sSQL  = "DELETE FROM atoms WHERE ID = '8';";

// The following won't work :
$result = $db->singleQuery($sSQL);

// But the following will :
$result = $db->query($sSQL);
?>

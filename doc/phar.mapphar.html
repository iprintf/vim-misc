Phar::mapPhar

(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 1.0.0)

Phar::mapPhar — Reads the currently executed file (a phar) and registers its
manifest

说明

final public static bool Phar::mapPhar ([ string $alias [, int $dataoffset = 0
]] )

This static method can only be used inside a Phar archive's loader stub in
order to initialize the phar when it is directly executed, or when it is
included in another script.

参数

alias

    The alias that can be used in phar:// URLs to refer to this archive, rather
    than its full path.

dataoffset

    Unused variable, here for compatibility with PEAR's PHP_Archive.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

错误／异常

PharException is thrown if not called directly within PHP execution, if no
__HALT_COMPILER(); token is found in the current source file, or if the file
cannot be opened for reading.

范例

Example #1 A Phar::mapPhar() example

mapPhar should be used only inside a phar's loader stub. Use loadPhar to load
an external phar into memory.

Here is a sample Phar loader stub that uses mapPhar.

<?php
function __autoload($class)
{
    include 'phar://me.phar/' . str_replace('_', '/', $class) . '.php';
}
try {
    Phar::mapPhar('me.phar');
    include 'phar://me.phar/startup.php';
} catch (PharException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
    die('Cannot initialize Phar');
}
__HALT_COMPILER();

===============================================================================

Be careful with mapPhar and opcode caches like opcache: They might cache files
included by the symbolic name based on the symbolic name you give.

This becomes a problem when a server is hosting multiple different versions of
a phar file all using the same symbolic name because then subsequent include()
's in the phar file might load an already cached file from another version of
the phar file.

Instead, generate a unique name and use that in mapPhar and in subsequent
include()'s

See for example https://github.com/zendtech/ZendOptimizerPlus/issues/115#
issuecomment-25612769 for the issue in the opcache module.

(PECL quickhash >= Unknown)

QuickHashIntStringHash::__construct — Creates a new QuickHashIntStringHash
object

说明

public QuickHashIntStringHash::__construct ( int $size [, int $options = 0 ] )

This constructor creates a new QuickHashIntStringHash. The size is the amount
of bucket lists to create. The more lists there are, the less collisions you
will have. Options are also supported.

参数

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 64 to 4194304.

options

    The options that you can pass in are:
    QuickHashIntStringHash::CHECK_FOR_DUPES, which makes sure no duplicate
    entries are added to the hash;
    QuickHashIntStringHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC to not use PHP's internal
    memory manager as well as one of QuickHashIntStringHash::HASHER_NO_HASH,
    QuickHashIntStringHash::HASHER_JENKINS1 or
    QuickHashIntStringHash::HASHER_JENKINS2. These last three configure which
    hashing algorithm to use. All options can be combined using bitmasks.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntStringHash object.

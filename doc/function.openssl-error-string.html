openssl_error_string — Return openSSL error message

说明

string openssl_error_string ( void )

openssl_error_string() returns the last error from the openSSL library. Error
messages are queued, so this function should be called multiple times to
collect all of the information. The last error will be the most recent one.

返回值

Returns an error message string, or FALSE if there are no more error messages
to return.

范例

Example #1 openssl_error_string() example

// lets assume you just called an openssl function that failed
while ($msg = openssl_error_string())
    echo $msg . "<br />\n";
?>

===============================================================================

Note that there may be two (or more) lines for one error.

Best to clear it out and read it for each openssl call.

PS
There are no "threads" and if the other library doesn't have enough sense to
read (and therefore clear) the queue (errr, dequeue) of messages before and
after their openssl calls...
A) That's their problem
B) Look for a new library, because NOT doing that means they aren't writing
their code properly.

Phar::loadPhar

(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 1.0.0)

Phar::loadPhar — Loads any phar archive with an alias

说明

final public static bool Phar::loadPhar ( string $filename [, string $alias ] )

This can be used to read the contents of an external Phar archive. This is most
useful for assigning an alias to a phar so that subsequent references to the
phar can use the shorter alias, or for loading Phar archives that only contain
data and are not intended for execution/inclusion in PHP scripts.

参数

filename

    the full or relative path to the phar archive to open

alias

    The alias that may be used to refer to the phar archive. Note that many
    phar archives specify an explicit alias inside the phar archive, and a
    PharException will be thrown if a new alias is specified in this case.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

错误／异常

PharException is thrown if an alias is passed in and the phar archive already
has an explicit alias

范例

Example #1 A Phar::loadPhar() example

Phar::loadPhar can be used anywhere to load an external Phar archive, whereas
Phar::mapPhar should be used in a loader stub for a Phar.

<?php
try {
    Phar::loadPhar('/path/to/phar.phar', 'my.phar');
    echo file_get_contents('phar://my.phar/file.txt');
} catch (PharException $e) {
    echo $e;
}
?>

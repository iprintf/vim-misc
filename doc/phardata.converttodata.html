PharData::convertToData — Convert a phar archive to a non-executable tar or zip
file

说明

PharData PharData::convertToData ([ int $format [, int $compression [, string
$extension ]]] )

This method is used to convert a non-executable tar or zip archive to another
non-executable format.

If no changes are specified, this method throws a BadMethodCallException. This
method should be used to convert a tar archive to zip format or vice-versa.
Although it is possible to simply change the compression of a tar archive using
this method, it is better to use the PharData::compress() method for logical
consistency.

If successful, the method creates a new archive on disk and returns a PharData
object. The old archive is not removed from disk, and should be done manually
after the process has finished.

参数

format

    This should be one of Phar::TAR or Phar::ZIP. If set to NULL, the existing
    file format will be preserved.

compression

    This should be one of Phar::NONE for no whole-archive compression, Phar::GZ
    for zlib-based compression, and Phar::BZ2 for bzip-based compression.

extension

    This parameter is used to override the default file extension for a
    converted archive. Note that .phar cannot be used anywhere in the filename
    for a non-executable tar or zip archive.

    If converting to a tar-based phar archive, the default extensions are .tar,
    .tar.gz, and .tar.bz2 depending on specified compression. For zip-based
    archives, the default extension is .zip.

返回值

The method returns a PharData object on success and throws an exception on
failure.

错误／异常

This method throws BadMethodCallException when unable to compress, an unknown
compression method has been specified, the requested archive is buffering with 
Phar::startBuffering() and has not concluded with Phar::stopBuffering(), and a
PharException if any problems are encountered during the phar creation process.

范例

Example #1 A PharData::convertToData() example

Using PharData::convertToData():

<?php
try {
    $tarphar = new PharData('myphar.tar');
    // note that myphar.tar is *not* unlinked
    // convert it to the non-executable tar file format
    // creates myphar.zip
    $zip = $tarphar->convertToData(Phar::ZIP);
    // create myphar.tbz
    $tgz = $zip->convertToData(Phar::TAR, Phar::BZ2, '.tbz');
    // creates myphar.phar.tgz
    $phar = $tarphar->convertToData(Phar::PHAR); // throws exception
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // handle the error here
}
?>

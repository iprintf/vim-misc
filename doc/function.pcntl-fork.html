pcntl_fork

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pcntl_fork — 在当前进程当前位置产生分支（子进程）。译注：fork是创建了一个子进程
，父进程和子进程都从fork的位置开始向下继续执行，不同的是父进程执行过程中，得到
的fork返回值为子进程号，而子进程得到的是0。

说明

int pcntl_fork ( void )

pcntl_fork()函数创建一个子进程，这个子进程仅PID（进程号）和PPID（父进程号）与其
父进程不同。fork怎样在您的系统工作的详细信息请查阅您的系统的fork（2）手册。

返回值

成功时，在父进程执行线程内返回产生的子进程的PID，在子进程执行线程内返回0。失败
时，在父进程上下文返回-1，不会创建子进程，并且会引发一个PHP错误。

范例

Example #1 pcntl_fork() 示例

<?php

$pid = pcntl_fork();
//父进程和子进程都会执行下面代码
if ($pid == -1) {
    //错误处理：创建子进程失败时返回-1.
     die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
     //父进程会得到子进程号，所以这里是父进程执行的逻辑
     pcntl_wait($status); //等待子进程中断，防止子进程成为僵尸进程。
} else {
     //子进程得到的$pid为0, 所以这里是子进程执行的逻辑。
}

?>

Its been easy to fork process with pcntl_fork.. but how can we control or
process further once all child processes gets completed.. here is the way we
can do that...

<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; ++$i) {
        $pid = pcntl_fork();

        if (!$pid) {
            sleep(1);
            print "In child $i\n";
            exit($i);
        }
    }

    while (pcntl_waitpid(0, $status) != -1) {
        $status = pcntl_wexitstatus($status);
        echo "Child $status completed\n";
    }
?>

I just thought of contributing to this awesome community and hope this can be
of use to someone. Although PHP provides threaded options, and multi curl
handles that run in parallel, I managed to bash out a solution to run each
function as it's own process for non-threaded versions of PHP.

Usage:  #!/usr/bin/php
Usage: php -f /path/to/file

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function fork_process($options)
{
    $shared_memory_monitor = shmop_open(ftok(__FILE__, chr(0)), "c", 0644, 
count($options['process']));
    $shared_memory_ids = (object) array();
    for ($i = 1; $i <= count($options['process']); $i++)
    {
        $shared_memory_ids->$i = shmop_open(ftok(__FILE__, chr($i)), "c", 0644,
$options['size']);
    }
    for ($i = 1; $i <= count($options['process']); $i++)
    {
        $pid = pcntl_fork();
        if (!$pid)
        {
            if($i==1)
                usleep(100000);
            $shared_memory_data = $options['process'][$i - 1]();
            shmop_write($shared_memory_ids->$i, $shared_memory_data, 0);
            shmop_write($shared_memory_monitor, "1", $i-1);
            exit($i);
        }
    }
    while (pcntl_waitpid(0, $status) != -1)
    {
        if(shmop_read($shared_memory_monitor, 0, count($options['process'])) ==
str_repeat("1", count($options['process'])))
        {
            $result = array();
            foreach($shared_memory_ids as $key=>$value)
            {
                $result[$key-1] = shmop_read($shared_memory_ids->$key, 0, 
$options['size']);
                shmop_delete($shared_memory_ids->$key);
            }
            shmop_delete($shared_memory_monitor);
            $options['callback']($result);
        }   
    }
}

// Create shared memory block of size 1M for each function.
$options['size'] = pow(1024,2);

// Define 2 functions to run as its own process.
$options['process'][0] = function()
{
    // Whatever you need goes here...
    // If you need the results, return its value.
    // Eg: Long running proccess 1
    sleep(1);
    return 'Hello ';
};
$options['process'][1] = function()
{
    // Whatever you need goes here...
    // If you need the results, return its value.
    // Eg:
    // Eg: Long running proccess 2
    sleep(1);
    return 'World!';
};
$options['callback'] = function($result)
{
    // $results is an array of return values...
    // $result[0] for $options['process'][0] &
    // $result[1] for $options['process'][1] &
    // Eg:
    echo $result[0].$result[1]."\n";   
};
fork_process($options);

?>

If you'd like to get the results back from a webpage, use exec(). Eg: echo exec
('php -f /path/to/file');

Continue hacking! :)
===============================================================================

If you want to execute some code after your php page has been returned to the
user. Try something like this -

<?php
function index()
{
        function shutdown() {
            posix_kill(posix_getpid(), SIGHUP);
        }

        // Do some initial processing

        echo("Hello World");

        // Switch over to daemon mode.

        if ($pid = pcntl_fork())
            return;     // Parent

        ob_end_clean(); // Discard the output buffer and close

        fclose(STDIN);  // Close all of the standard
        fclose(STDOUT); // file descriptors as we
        fclose(STDERR); // are running as a daemon.

        register_shutdown_function('shutdown');

        if (posix_setsid() < 0)
            return;

        if ($pid = pcntl_fork())
            return;     // Parent

        // Now running as a daemon. This process will even survive
        // an apachectl stop.

        sleep(10);

        $fp = fopen("/tmp/sdf123", "w");
        fprintf($fp, "PID = %s\n", posix_getpid());
        fclose($fp);

        return;
}
?>

The reason for the MySQL "Lost Connection during query" issue when forking is
the fact that the child process inherits the parent's database connection. When
the child exits, the connection is closed. If the parent is performing a query
at this very moment, it is doing it on an already closed connection, hence the
error.

An easy way to avoid this is to create a new database connection in parent
immediately after forking. Don't forget to force a new connection by passing
true in the 4th argument of mysql_connect():

<?php
// Create the MySQL connection
$db = mysql_connect($server, $username, $password);

$pid = pcntl_fork();
            
if ( $pid == -1 ) {       
    // Fork failed           
    exit(1);
} else if ( $pid ) {
    // We are the parent
    // Can no longer use $db because it will be closed by the child
    // Instead, make a new MySQL connection for ourselves to work with
    $db = mysql_connect($server, $username, $password, true);
} else {
    // We are the child
    // Do something with the inherited connection here
    // It will get closed upon exit
    exit(0);
?>

This way, the child will inherit the old connection, will work on it and will
close upon exit. The parent won't care, because it will open a new connection
for itself immediately after forking.

Hope this helps.

"Fatal Error" has always been the bane of my world because there is no way to
capture and handle the condition in PHP. My team builds almost everything in
PHP in order to leverage our core library of code, so it was of the essence to
find a solution for this problem of scripts bombing unrecoverably and us never
knowing about it.

One of our background automation systems creates a "task queue" of sorts and
for each task in the queue, a PHP module is include()ed to handle the task.
Sometimes however a poorly behaved module will nuke with a Fatal Error and take
out the parent script with it.

I decided to try to use pcntl_fork() to isolate the task module from the parent
code, and it seems to work: a Fatal Error generated within the module makes the
child task bomb, and the waiting parent can simply catch the return code from
the child and track/alert us to the problem as needed.

Naturally something similar could be done if I wanted to simply exec() the
module and check the output, but then I would not have the benefit of the
stateful environment that the parent script has so carefully prepared. This
allows me to keep the child process within the context of the parent's running
environment and not suffer the consequences of Fatal Errors stopping the task
queue from continuing to process.

Here is fork_n_wait.php for your amusement:

<?php

if (! function_exists('pcntl_fork')) die('PCNTL functions not available on this
PHP installation');

for ($x = 1; $x < 5; $x++) {
   switch ($pid = pcntl_fork()) {
      case -1:
         // @fail
         die('Fork failed');
         break;

      case 0:
         // @child: Include() misbehaving code here
         print "FORK: Child #{$x} preparing to nuke...\n";
         generate_fatal_error(); // Undefined function
         break;

      default:
         // @parent
         print "FORK: Parent, letting the child run amok...\n";
         pcntl_waitpid($pid, $status);
         break;
   }
}

print "Done! :^)\n\n";
?>

Which outputs:
php -q fork_n_wait.php
FORK: Child #1 preparing to nuke...
PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function generate_fatal_error() in
~fork_n_wait.php on line 16

There are quite a few questions regarding how file descriptors get handled when
processes are forked.

Remember that fork() makes a copy of the program, which means all descriptors
are copied. Unfortunately, this is a rather bad situation for a PHP program
because most descriptors are handled by PHP or a PHP Extension internally.

The simple, and probably "proper" way to solve this issue is to fork before
hand, there really should be no need to fork at many different points among a
program, you would simply fork, and then delegate the work. Use a master/worker
hierarchy.

For example, if you need to have many processes that use a MySQL Connection,
just fork before the connection is made, that way each child has it´s own
connection to mysql that it, and it alone, manages.

With careful and correct usage, fork() can be an extremely powerful tool.

--Please remember to take proper care of your children.
===============================================================================

Using pcntl_fork() can be a little tricky in some situations.  For fast jobs, a
child can finish processing before the parent process has executed some code
related to the launching of the process.  The parent can receive a signal
before it's ready to handle the child process' status.  To handle this
scenario, I add an id to a "queue" of processes in the signal handler that need
to be cleaned up if the parent process is not yet ready to handle them. 

I am including a stripped down version of a job daemon that should get a person
on the right track.

<?php
declare(ticks=1);
//A very basic job daemon that you can extend to your needs.
class JobDaemon{

    public $maxProcesses = 25;
    protected $jobsStarted = 0;
    protected $currentJobs = array();
    protected $signalQueue=array();  
    protected $parentPID;
  
    public function __construct(){
        echo "constructed \n";
        $this->parentPID = getmypid();
        pcntl_signal(SIGCHLD, array($this, "childSignalHandler"));
    }
  
    /**
    * Run the Daemon
    */
    public function run(){
        echo "Running \n";
        for($i=0; $i<10000; $i++){
            $jobID = rand(0,10000000000000);

            while(count($this->currentJobs) >= $this->maxProcesses){
               echo "Maximum children allowed, waiting...\n";
               sleep(1);
            }

            $launched = $this->launchJob($jobID);
        }
      
        //Wait for child processes to finish before exiting here
        while(count($this->currentJobs)){
            echo "Waiting for current jobs to finish... \n";

            // So let's go ahead and process it now as if we'd just received
the signal

you should be _very_ careful with using fork in scripts beyond academic
examples,
or rather just avoid it alltogether, unless you are very aware of it's
limitations.

the problem is that it just forks the whole php process, including not only
the state of the script, but also the internal state of any extensions loaded.
this means that all memory is copied, but all file descriptors are shared among
the parent and child processes.
and that can cause major havoc if some extension internally maintains
file descriptors.
the primary example is ofcourse mysql, but this could be any extensions that
maintains open files or network sockets.
also, just reopening your connection in the parent or child isn't a safe
method, because when the old connection resource is destroyed, the extension
might not just close it, but for example send a request to the server to log
off, making the connection unusable.
this happens with mysql for example, when php exits - in the following script
the query will always fail with "MySQL server has gone away":

<?php
mysql_connect(/* enter a working server here maybe? */);
if(pcntl_fork()) die(); // fork a child and have the parent terminate
//if(pcntl_fork()) posix_kill(getmypid(),9); // works, but very ugly
$r=mysql_query("select 1;");
if(!$r)die(mysql_error()."\n");
?>
(it was suggested that processes kill themselves with SIGKILL to avoid any
cleanup on shutdown)

(the only save way would be to close all connections and reopen them after the
fork, and even that might not be possible if an extension keeps one open
internally)

for a nice demonstration of the havoc fork can create, try the below script.
it opens a mysql connection, then forks, and runs queries from both parent and
child,
verifying that it receives the correct result.
run it (on the cli preferably) a few times, and you will find various possible
results:
- very often is just hangs and doesn't output anything anymore
- also very often, the server closes the connection, probably because it
  receives interleaved requests it can't process.
- sometimes one process gets the result of the OTHER processes'
  query! (because both send their queries down the same socket,
  and it's pure luck who gets the reply)

<?php
mysql_connect(/* enter a working server here maybe? */);
$f=pcntl_fork();
while(true){
    sleep(rand(0,10)/100);
    $r=mysql_query("select $f;");
    if(!$r)die($f.": ".mysql_error()."\n");
    list($x)=mysql_fetch_array($r);
    echo ($f)?".":"-";
    if($x!=$f) echo ($f.": fail: $x!=$f\n ");
}
?>
===============================================================================

The notes on http://php.net/manual/en/function.posix-setsid.php describe how
you can avoid accruing countless zombie processes by a simple call to
posix_setsid() when a child starts.
===============================================================================

It was driving me crazy that the script was killed couple of hours after I
logged out, even I started it as:

php server.php >& logfile.txt

looks like PHP somehow interact with standard input, even I do not used it.

Solution was to start it with nohup:

nohup php server.php >& logfile.txt

or to do demonize / run as demon (e.g. fork() and close file descriptors)
===============================================================================

A workaround for the MySQL "Lost Connection during query", or any other object
related problems caused by children exiting is to force the child to kill -9
itself, thus avoiding any cleanup.  Sure - it's not too elegant, but it does
work.

<?php
$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ( $pid == 0 ) {
    // This is the child process.  Do something here.
    // Instead of calling exit(), we use posix_kill()
    posix_kill(getmypid(),9);
}
?>

Watch out that you don't spawn too many processes though as this creates its
own problems.
===============================================================================

When using fork to run multiple children processes on a single job queue using
mysql, I used mysql_affected_rows() to prevent collisions between workers:

First I find a "free" job:
SELECT job_id FROM queue WHERE status="free"

Then I update the queue:
UPDATE queue SET worker_id={$worker_id} WHERE job_id={$job_id}

Then I see if the row was changed

<?php
if(mysql_affected_rows() == 0)
{
//the row hasn't changed, so it must mean that another worker has claimed the
job, so I go back to the "find a free job" query
}
else
{
//do the job
}
?>
===============================================================================

Fork in foreach:

<?php
foreach ($tasks as $v)
        {if (($pid=pcntl_fork())===-1)
            {//...
             continue;
            }
         else if ($pid)
              {pcntl_wait($status, WNOHANG); //protect against zombie children,
one wait vs one child
              }
         else if ($pid===0)
              {ob_start();//prevent output to main process
               register_shutdown_function(create_function('$pars', 
'ob_end_clean();posix_kill(getmypid(), SIGKILL);'), array());//to kill self
before exit();, or else the resource shared with parent will be closed
               //...
               exit();//avoid foreach loop in child process
              }
        }
?>
===============================================================================

It is not possible to use the function 'pcntl_fork' when PHP is used as Apache
module. You can only use pcntl_fork in CGI mode or from command-line.

Using this function will result in: 'Fatal error: Call to undefined function:
pcntl_fork()'
===============================================================================

The following exemple works with php5.6 and apcu. This was tested on debian 7
and Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.

Here is a proposition of a simple Job class which execute a task list upon a
item queue with shared memory capability :

class Job
{
    const
        CACHE_PREFIX = 'SHM/',
        WORKER_NUMBER = 10;

    private
        $_queues = [],
        $_tasks = [],
        $_pids = [],
        $_workerNumber,
        $_cacheHandler,
        $_prefix,
        $_id;

    public function __construct(array $queue, $workerNumber =
self::WORKER_NUMBER)
    {
        $count = count($queue);

        $length = ceil($count / $workerNumber);

        $this->_queues = array_chunk($queue, $length);

        $this->setWorkerNumber($workerNumber);

        $this->_prefix = self::CACHE_PREFIX . microtime(true) . '/';
    }

    public function setWorkerNumber($workerNumber)
    {
        $this->_workerNumber = $workerNumber;
    }

    public function __get($key)
    {
        return apc_fetch($this->_prefix . $key);
    }

    public function __set($key, $value)
    {
        apc_store($this->_prefix . $key, $value);
    }

    public function add(Closure $task)
    {
        $this->_tasks[] = $task->bindTo($this, $this);

        return $this;
    }

    public function run(Closure $task = null)
    {
        if (isset($task))
        {
            $this->add($task);
        }

        $i = 0;

        do

Workaround to pcntl_fork() not being usable when PHP is run as an Apache module

function background_job($program, $args)
{
    # The following doesn't work when running PHP as an apache module
    /*
    $pid = pcntl_fork();
    pcntl_signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);

    if ($pid == 0)
    {
        posix_setsid();
        pcntl_exec($program, $args, $_ENV);
        exit(0);
    }
    */

    # Workaround
    $args = join(' ', array_map('escapeshellarg', $args));
    exec("$program $args 2>/dev/null >&- /dev/null &");

I was able to get around the problem of not being able to run fork and exec
from Apache php.

I got around this by calling the system 'at' command on Linux.  "at run
something now".  and you have to set atrun -s in a crontab file (to run every
minute) to insure that things get kicked off quickly even if there is a heavy
load on the machine.

If you're the only one running batch jobs on a linux box, this works.

Here is an interesting script I wrote.  It demonstrates how pcntl_fork() might
be used as a useful tool.

<?php
/* This script serves the purpose of testing an algorithm designed to:
a.) Compare password hashes, or try passwords efficiently where the time to try
a single password is 10 seconds. 
b.) Spawn threads to work simultaneously on comparing hashes.
c.) Restrict the number of threads open at a time.

        return false;
        }

10 seconds.  Interval may increase or decrease in size to use more or less
memory.

    $min = floor($num);
    $min = 12*$min;
    $max = $min+2;

With regards to the database connection, one could deal with this using kill 9
or a sleep, the real problem is if two threads make a database query at the
same time, PHP starts having random database errors that are not necessarily
clear as to what the problem is.

You should create a separate link per thread.

I was writing a shell script to get input from a user, however, I needed my
script to time out after a certain number of seconds if the user didn't enter
enough data. The code below descibes the method I used. It's a little hairy but
it does work.

-Ben

#!/home/ben/php/bin/php -q
<?php
//GLOBALS
$RETURN_CHAR = "\n";
$TIMEOUT = 5; //number of seconds to timeout on input
$PID = getmypid();
$CHILD_PID = 0;

//Make sure program execution doesn't time out
set_time_limit(0);

function set_timeout() {
global $PID;
global $CHILD_PID;
global $TIMEOUT;

$CHILD_PID = pcntl_fork();
if($CHILD_PID == 0) {
sleep($TIMEOUT);
posix_kill($PID, SIGTERM);
exit;
}
}

function clear_timeout() {
global $CHILD_PID;
posix_kill($CHILD_PID, SIGTERM);
}

// read_data()
// gets a line of data from STDIN and returns it
function read_data() {

$in = fopen("php://stdin", "r");
set_timeout();
$in_string = fgets($in, 255);
clear_timeout();
fclose($in);
return $in_string;
}

// write_data($outstring)
// writes data to STDOUT
function write_data($outstring) {
$out = fopen("php://stdout", "w");
fwrite($out, $outstring);
fclose($out);
}

while(1) {
write_data("say something->");
$input = read_data();
write_data($RETURN_CHAR.$input);
}

?>

I think this simple code can help understand how fork works:

<?php
echo "posix_getpid()=".posix_getpid().", posix_getppid()=".posix_getppid()."\n"
;

$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) die("could not fork");
if ($pid) {
    echo "pid=".$pid.", posix_getpid()=".posix_getpid().", posix_getppid()=".
posix_getppid()."\n";
} else {
    echo "pid=".$pid.", posix_getpid()=".posix_getpid().", posix_getppid()=".
posix_getppid()."\n";
}
?>

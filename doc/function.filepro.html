filepro — Read and verify the map file

说明

bool filepro ( string $directory )

This reads and verifies the map file, storing the field count and info.

No locking is done, so you should avoid modifying your filePro database while
it may be opened in PHP.

    Note: 当启用安全模式时， PHP 会检查被操作的文件或目录是否与被执行的脚本有相
    同的 UID（所有者）。

参数

directory

    The map directory.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

filepro() is apparently expecting the map file to be lowercase (at least on
UNIX-like systems).
===============================================================================

Two notes here:

1) PHP does not need a running copy of filepro to read the datafiles.  Just
provide it with a directory containing the map file, key file, and the data*
file(s) for the table you want to read. Screen files, outfiles, and process
files are not used.

2) This function seems to pass back the system error code in brackets [] along
with the PHP warning.  A list of error codes can be found in your filepro
manual's appendix.

pg_affected_rows

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_affected_rows — 返回受影响的记录数目

说明

int pg_affected_rows ( resource $result )

pg_affected_rows() 返回在 pg_query() 中执行 INSERT，UPDATE 和 DELETE 查询后受到
影响的记录数目（包括实例／记录／行）。如果本函数没有影响到任何记录，则返回 0。

Example #1 pg_affected_rows() 例子

<?php
$result = pg_query($conn, "INSERT INTO authors VALUES 
('Orwell', 2002, 'Animal Farm')");
$cmdtuples = pg_affected_rows($result);
echo $cmdtuples . " tuples are affected.\n";
?>

    Note:

    本函数以前被称为 pg_cmdtuples()。

参见 pg_query() 和 pg_num_rows()。

===============================================================================

pg-affected-rows () only runs on the LAST SQL STATEMENT executed.  If you
compound several statements together then pg_affected_rows might not return
what you expect. 

For example:

<?php

$result = pg_query ('BEGIN; INSERT INTO foo (bar) VALUES (\'baz\'; COMMIT');

echo (pg_affected_rows ($result));

?>

will cause 0 to be printed, because the last statement executed by Postgres was
COMMIT, which doesn't affect any rows. 

I haven't tried this so am not certain it works, but you SHOULD be able to get
the row counts you want if you split your queries up. 

For example:

<?php

$result = pg_query ('BEGIN; INSERT INTO foo (bar) VALUES (\'baz\';');

echo (pg_affected_rows ($result));

pg_query ('COMMIT;');
?>

should allow you to get the number of rows affected by the previous query.  I
haven't tried this yet though, so don't count on it.
===============================================================================

Note that when you submit several SQL queries, within one BEGIN;COMMIT; like
this one :

$SQLQuery = 'BEGIN;';
$SQLQuery.= 'INSERT INTO a (a,b) VALUES (1,2);';
$SQLQuery.= 'INSERT INTO b (ref_b,c) VALUES (2,5);';
$SQLQuery.= 'COMMIT;';

$HandleResults = pg_query($SQLQuery);
echo(pg_affected_rows($HandleResults));

pg_affected_rows() will return 0
===============================================================================

There is something called auto-commit, when you supply more than one query
delimited by ; semicolon all-or-none is done if one fails. No need for BEGIN;
COMMIT;ROLLBACK when doing one query. its logic to mee pg_affected_rows()
returns affected rows and if you want to do 2 queries apart from each other..
do a BEGIN and then 1 and get pg_affected_rows() then do 2 and get
pg_affected_rows() and then finally do COMMIT;
===============================================================================

That's not quite true, I've been able to execute multiple queries in a single
call just fine. In stead, it has to do with the fact this function returns the
affected rows for the last executed query, not the last set of queries
specified to a single call to pg_query.
===============================================================================

Concering Bruno Baguette's note:

The pg_query function only allows one query per function call.  When you do
your
$sql="BEGIN;
INSERT ...
COMMIT;";
$result=pg_query($conn,$sql);
echo pg_affected_rows($result);

you get a zero, because only the BEGIN; is executed.

The single query per call is, I beleive, a PHP builtin protection against SQL
injection attacks.  (Ie someone submitting a string paramter that ends the
current query and appends another one)

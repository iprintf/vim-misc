MongoCollection::deleteIndex

(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

MongoCollection::deleteIndex — Deletes an index from this collection

说明

public array MongoCollection::deleteIndex ( string|array $keys )

This method is identical to:

<?php

public function deleteIndexes($keys) {
  $indexName = $this->toIndexString($keys);

  return $this->db->command(array(
    "deleteIndexes" => $this->getName(),
    "index" => $indexName,
  ));
}

?>

Each index is given a unique name when it is created. This is often generated
by the driver based on the index key(s) and order/type, but custom names may
also be specified with MongoCollection::createIndex()'s "name" option).

Unfortunately, MongoCollection::deleteIndex() cannot delete custom-named
indexes due to a backwards compatibility issue. When a string argument is
provided, it is assumed to be the single field name in an ascending index (e.g.
the name "x_1" would be used for the argument "x"). If an array or object is
provided, an index name is generated just as if that argument was passed to 
MongoCollection::createIndex().

In order to delete a custom-named index with the PHP driver, the deleteIndexes
database command must be used. For instance, an index named "myIndex" could be
deleted with the PHP driver by running:

<?php

$db->command(array(
  "deleteIndexes" => $collection->getName(),
  "index" => "myIndex",
));

?>

To determine the name of an index with the PHP driver, you can query the
system.indexes collection of a database and look for the "name" field of each
result. The "ns" field will indicate the collection to which each index
belongs.

参数

keys

    An array specifying the index's fields as its keys. For each field, the
    value is either the index direction or » index type. If specifying
    direction, specify 1 for ascending or -1 for descending.

    If a string is provided, it is assumed to be the single field name in an
    ascending index.

返回值

Returns the database response.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::deleteIndex() example

This example passes the function string and array parameters.

<?php

$m = new MongoClient();
$c = $m->example->indices;

// create and remove a simple index
$c->createIndex(array("i"=>1));
$c->deleteIndex("i");

// create and remove a multi-key index
$c->ensureIndex(array("j" => 1, "k" => 1));
$c->deleteIndex(array("j" => 1, "k" => 1));

?>

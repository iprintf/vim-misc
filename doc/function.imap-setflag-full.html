Spent ages trying to get this to work, then eventually remembered I had opened
the mailbox READONLY - obviously you need write permission for setting flags!
===============================================================================

Where possible I would avoid using POP3 accounts. My host allowed me to upgrade
to IMAP and it is so much easier. I think the only way to accurately create any
form of mail client with POP3 is to download the messages into an SQL database
which is a big task to start with, considering the IMAP standards have the
functionality we need built in.
I experimented with flag setting in POP3 and it seems they do not stick at all,
and it is almost impossible to retrieve the number of unread messages (ie. the
Seen / Unseen thing does not work)
Converted to IMAP and it's working - the majority of the functions in this
section seem to be IMAP focussed and WILL NOT generally work with POP3
===============================================================================

Use the imap_clearflag_full function if you want to unset the \Seen flag.

The pop3 does indeed support the deleted flag - I have been working with the
IMAP functions connection to a POP3 server this past week and lucky me it
works.
===============================================================================

Indeed POP3 does not support flags that indicate the "newness" of a message.
There are other ways to work around this problem, though. For one, I have seen
mail delivery systems that will add a header field Status: to indicate its
status (see RFC2076). Another way most email clients and mail fetching programs
seem to use is to keep a local list of UID's of messages that are downloaded.
Upon fetching mail, the UID's of the messages can be checked against this list
to see if it was already downloaded. POP3 supports a command UIDL to get a list
of all UID's, but I doubt the IMAP lib uses this command. The only thing I know
of that will thrash this work-around is the use of multiple mail clients. If
another mail client fetches mail from the server, the first client has no way
of knowing it has been downloaded.
===============================================================================

According to the rfc, pop3 does not have support for these flags, except
perhaps for the deleted flag. I haven't tried if the delete flag works on pop3
or not.
===============================================================================

To correct phpidiot at avanca-a dot de

<?php

imap_setflag_full($mbox, '1', 'label1');

?>
===============================================================================

"Keywords" aka "tags" aka "PERMANENTFLAGS" can be added if your server supports
IMAP 4rev1 by using $label{label-nr}:

<?php

$mbox = imap_open("{imap.example.org:143}", "username", "password")
     or die("can't connect: " . imap_last_error());

$status = imap_setflag_full($mbox, "2,5", "\$label1");

echo gettype($status) . "\n";
echo $status . "\n";

imap_close($mbox);
?>
===============================================================================

I've finally managed to get some action out of this function. Here is some code
that might work help some people out:

$headers = imap_headers($link);
for($x=0; $x < count($headers); $x++) {
    $id = substr($headers[$x],5,4);
    imap_setflag_full($link,imap_uid($link,$id),'\\SEEN',SE_UID);
}

Good luck.
===============================================================================

The imap_setflag_full-function works with pop3 as long as the connection is NOT
closed. if you make

imap_setflag_full($mbox, imap_uid($mbox, 0), "\\Seen \\Flagged", ST_UID);
   
print_r( imap_headerinfo($mbox, 0) );

you see the flags set, but if you call the box again with another script, the
flags are empty again.
I tried this on a WinNT (*ugly*) with IIS 4.0 and a running POP3-server with
PHP 4.3.

mssql_fetch_array

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PECL odbtp >= 1.1.1)

mssql_fetch_array — Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

Warning

This function was REMOVED in PHP 7.0.0.

Alternatives to this function include:

  • PDOStatement::fetch()
  • sqlsrv_fetch_array()
  • odbc_fetch_array()

说明

array mssql_fetch_array ( resource $result [, int $result_type = MSSQL_BOTH ] )

mssql_fetch_array() is an extended version of mssql_fetch_row(). In addition to
storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores the
data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using mssql_fetch_array() is NOT
significantly slower than using mssql_fetch_row(), while it provides a
significant added value.

参数

result

    The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a call
    to mssql_query().

result_type

    The type of array that is to be fetched. It's a constant and can take the
    following values: MSSQL_ASSOC, MSSQL_NUM, and MSSQL_BOTH.

返回值

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

范例

Example #1 mssql_fetch_array() example

<?php
// Send a select query to MSSQL
$query = mssql_query('SELECT [username], [name] FROM [php].[dbo].[userlist]');

// Check if there were any records
if (!mssql_num_rows($query)) {
    echo 'No records found';
} else {
    // The following is equal to the code below:
    //
    // while ($row = mssql_fetch_row($query)) {

    while ($row = mssql_fetch_array($query, MSSQL_NUM)) {
        // ...
    }
}

// Free the query result
mssql_free_result($query);
?>

===============================================================================

Calling this function with the option second parameter is causing a "Wrong
parameter count" message. If you run into this problem, you can get the same
effect by calling different functions:

mssql_fetch_array: MSSQL_BOTH
mssql_fetch_assoc: MSSQL_ASSOC
mssql_fetch_row: MSSQL_NUM
===============================================================================

Note that if you fetch varchar fields larger than 255 letters the result will
be cut off at 255 letters.

To prevent this you have to do a CONVERT(TEXT,data_field) for this fields in
your select clause.

Using the $row = mssql_fetch_array($result)

A null value will return 0, this is a problem if you are using 0 and some
identifier for a value.  you should convert all nulls to something like -1 or
"NO VALUE"

******

After extensive testing, the above statements both seem to be true. You *can*
distinguish between 0 and null values in PHP; however, the mssql_fetch_array
function does not set null colums to the php NULL value.

if ($row['Null_Column'] === 0) { print('pass'); }

A null column passes the above test. Seems to be a bug in the function.

from php-dev mailing list article -
#26012 [Bgs]: mssql_fetch_array

"Previously mssql data was always rtrimed, however that's wrong because it
modifies the original data. This caused a problem for people who needed those
trailing space. Ultimately, the job of database extension is to fetch the data
as is (like other db extensions already do) and not to mangle it in any way."

moving from <4.3.4 to a higher version you will have this now:

$query = "Select dumb_spaces from dbo.table where weak_sause = 'true'";
$result = mssql_query($query) or die("Spicy Sause! Query = $query");

while($line = mssql_fetch_array($result, MSSQL_ASSOC) {
     foreach($line as $bs_trim) {
          //Trim whitespace from end of query
          $bs_trim = rtrim($bs_trim);
          echo "Clean!".$bs_trim;
     }
}
===============================================================================

Apparently php 4.0.6 does not support the second parameter. When used the error
sounds
"Wrong parameter count for mssql_fetch_array"
===============================================================================

Note that the second parameter is the same as the msql version of this function
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.msql-fetch-array.php) with the constants
(MSQL_ASSOC, MSQL_NUM, and MSQL_BOTH) changing to MSSQL_.

Also note that if you don't specify this parameter you'll get both the numbers
and column names, which can cause some frustration.
===============================================================================

I just spent a few hours trying to get ntext data with this function, CASTing
and CONVERTing every which way, and scouring the 'net. Nothing worked, I just
got a NULL.

Then on a whim I tried it with mssql_fetch_row instead, and that DOES work.

To write Unicode (nvarchar) to SQL2000/2005 use PHP
用PHP在SQL Server 存取Unicode資料
----------------------------------------------

Let's assume, we have following data table, that allows us to store unicode
values (using UCS-2 encoding):

    create table mytable    (
        myfield nvarchar (100) null
    );

Below is the code to work with:

<?php
    $link = mssql_connect('dbhost', 'username', 'password');
    mssql_select_db('database', $link);

    // sending data to database
    $utf8 = 'some unicode UTF-8 data';  // some Greek text for example ;)
    $ucs2 = iconv('UTF-8', 'UCS-2LE', $utf8);

    // converting UCS-2 string into "binary" hexadecimal form
    $arr = unpack('H*hex', $ucs2);
    $hex = "0x{$arr['hex']}";

    // IMPORTANT!
    // please note that value must be passed without apostrophes
    // it should be "... values(0x0123456789ABCEF) ...", not "... values
('0x0123456789ABCEF') ..."
    mssql_query("insert into mytable (myfield) values ({$hex})", $link);

    // retrieving data from database
    // IMPORTANT!
    // please note that "varbinary" expects number of bytes
    // in this example it must be 200 (bytes), while size of field is 100
(UCS-2 chars)

    $result = mssql_query("select convert(varbinary(200), myfield) from
mytable", $link);

    while (($row = mssql_fetch_array($result, MSSQL_BOTH)))
    {
        // we get data in UCS-2
        // I use UTF-8 in my project, so I encode it back
        echo(iconv('UCS-2LE', 'UTF-8', $row['myfield']));
    }

    mssql_free_result($result);
    mssql_close($link);
?>
===============================================================================

Allthough probably obvious to people who have used the functions available to
other databases it during writing is not present in this entry that result type
can be entered as MSSQL_ASSOC or MSSQL_NUM, and the default value when nothing
entered being MSSQL_BOTH

In response to my last post:

After further testing, it appears as though the null column bug only affects
windows installations. On my linux installation using freetds-0.61.2, the
function behaves properly. It must exist either in the php_mssql.dll or the
Microsoft connection libraries. And since I use this functionality through ASP
as well (which uses the Microsoft connection libraries), it would lead me to
believe that it's an issue within the php_mssql.dll.
===============================================================================

It seems that this function creates arrays wich keys can not be longer than 30
chars. So when you're having a DB-field like
"this_is_a_very_long_db_field_name"
its array-key is cut off after 30 chars and you will have to access the value
with
rs["this_is_a_very_long_db_field_n"]
===============================================================================

Using the $row = mssql_fetch_array($result)

A null value will return 0, this is a problem if you are using 0 and some
identifier for a value.  you should convert all nulls to something like -1 or
"NO VALUE"
===============================================================================

The array_walk function is also useful for stripping the whitespace returned in
an mssql_query.

function modify_field(&$array) {
    $array = trim($array);
}

$query = "select * from dbo.table where value = '0'";
$result = mssql_query($query) or die;

while ($row = mssql_fetch_array($result)) {
    // This will call the above function.
    array_walk($row, 'modify_field');
    array_push($eventresults, $row);
}

An added benefit is that you can expand the modify_field function to handled
unexpected returned column data.

Please note that empty tags like <span></span> will be automatically converted
to the short notation <span />.  This could cause trouble in some cases.

Be aware that when you extract a piece of XML from a larger XML document using
the readOuterXML() function, it tries to determine the namespaces (as defined
in the original XML document) that apply to the new piece, and inserts them
into the appropriate tags as xmlns attributes. This can be disconcerting, but
it should be a benign alteration in most cases, and I understand that it causes
the new chunk of XML to be correctly formatted so it is valid in it's own
right.

As far as I'm aware it's not possible to change this behaviour.

purpose

                     openssl_x509_checkpurpose() purposes

it cannot, or -1 on error.

The following is an example usage of openssl_x509_checkpurpose. It is
equivalent to the openssl verify command as follows:
openssl verify -CApath $openssl_cadir -purpose sslserver $openssl_crtfile

<?php
$openssl_crtfile='auth.combined.pem';
$openssl_cadir='./ca';

$x509_res = openssl_x509_read(file_get_contents($openssl_crtfile));
if(empty($x509_res)) {
        echo 'x509 cert could not be read'."\n";
}
$valid = openssl_x509_checkpurpose($x509_res,X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER,array(
$openssl_cadir));
if ($valid === true) {
        echo 'Certificate is valid for use as SSL server'."\n";
} else {
        echo 'Certificate validation returned'.$valid."\n";
}
?>

Few days ago I dual boot my system into Windows 8 and play around with it, and
then I boot it back to windows 7, and all of sudden this function fails by
returning me 0 all the time.

Spent almost two hours digging google for no result, I almost end my research.

Then (I don't know why) I did a system time update (synchronize with
time.nist.gov), and all of sudden, this function returns me 1 (true).

It's true that when I boot back to Windows 7 my time has been screwed by a few
hours later than my current time, and I did a manual change on it. I doubt this
has anything to do with this function?

Hope it helps.

sybase_pconnect

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sybase_pconnect — Open persistent Sybase connection

说明

resource sybase_pconnect ([ string $servername [, string $username [, string
$password [, string $charset [, string $appname ]]]]] )

sybase_pconnect() acts very much like sybase_connect() with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
sybase_close() will not close links established by sybase_pconnect()).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

参数

servername

    The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is defined in the
    'interfaces' file.

username

    Sybase user name

password

    Password associated with username.

charset

    Specifies the charset for the connection

appname

    Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection. This allow you to make
    separate connections in the same script to the same database. This may come
    handy when you have started a transaction in your current connection, and
    you need to be able to do a separate query which cannot be performed inside
    this transaction.

返回值

Returns a positive Sybase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.

===============================================================================

The servername specified in sybase_connect and sybase_pconnect is solved
locally on the PHP3 server host, which should be configured with the
appropriate Sybase client configuration. This includes setting the environment
variables for the account that runs the PHP3 extension, i.e. if it runs as a
Web server extension, it must be configured in the user account that runs the
Web server. You may setup at least the SYBASE environment, and add $SYBASE/bin
within the user's path that runs the Web server. Standard installations of
Sybase clients include setting up either a $SYBASE/interfaces file under Unix,
or %SYBASE%\ini\sql.ini under Windows. This file contains local aliasnames for
the referenced server names. These names may be different than that really used
on the host that run the Sybase SQL Server. What is important is that this
Sybase client configuration file will specify the location of the SQL Server,
i.e. the network protocol to use, and if it's through TCP/IP, the host name or
IP address of the Sybase SQL Server host, and its listener port number. Newer
versions of Sybase includes the option to setup the interfaces or SQL.INI file
with a single server entry, with will be a Sybase naming service. If this is
used, the Sybase OpenClient libraries will connect to this naming service, if
the SERVER name specified can't be solved locally. This naming service will
provide the SQL Server location for the specified SERVER name you use in the
sybase_connect or sybase_pconnect function calls, allowinf naming resolution on
sites that want to have a centralized administration of multiple Sybase
OpenServer servers, including gateways to other SQL servers such as OpenServer
compatible gateways to Oracle or Informix servers. But if you want faster
accesses to your Sybase SQL server used by your PHP3 scripts, you should
configure the host which runs the PHP3 extension so that servernames can be
solved locally. All you need is to add server entries in your interfaces or
SQL.INI Sybase OpenClient configuration file.

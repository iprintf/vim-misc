EventBufferEvent::sslRenegotiate

EventBufferEvent::sslRenegotiate — Tells a bufferevent to begin SSL
renegotiation.

说明

public void EventBufferEvent::sslRenegotiate ( void )

Tells a bufferevent to begin SSL renegotiation.

Warning

Calling this function tells the SSL to renegotiate, and the buffer event to
invoke appropriate callbacks. This is an advanced topic; this should be
generally avoided unless one really knows what he/she does, especially since
many SSL versions have had known security issues related to renegotiation.

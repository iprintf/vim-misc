odbc_setoption — Adjust ODBC settings

说明

bool odbc_setoption ( resource $id , int $function , int $option , int $param )

This function allows fiddling with the ODBC options for a particular connection
or query result. It was written to help find work around to problems in quirky
ODBC drivers. You should probably only use this function if you are an ODBC
programmer and understand the effects the various options will have. You will
certainly need a good ODBC reference to explain all the different options and
values that can be used. Different driver versions support different options.

Because the effects may vary depending on the ODBC driver, use of this function
in scripts to be made publicly available is strongly discouraged. Also, some
ODBC options are not available to this function because they must be set before
the connection is established or the query is prepared. However, if on a
particular job it can make PHP work so your boss doesn't tell you to use a
commercial product, that's all that really matters.

参数

id

    Is a connection id or result id on which to change the settings. For
    SQLSetConnectOption(), this is a connection id. For SQLSetStmtOption(),
    this is a result id.

function

    Is the ODBC function to use. The value should be 1 for SQLSetConnectOption
    () and 2 for SQLSetStmtOption().

option

    The option to set.

param

    The value for the given option.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 odbc_setoption() examples

<?php
// 1. Option 102 of SQLSetConnectOption() is SQL_AUTOCOMMIT.
//    Value 1 of SQL_AUTOCOMMIT is SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_ON.
//    This example has the same effect as
//    odbc_autocommit($conn, true);

odbc_setoption($conn, 1, 102, 1);

// 2. Option 0 of SQLSetStmtOption() is SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT.
//    This example sets the query to timeout after 30 seconds.

$result = odbc_prepare($conn, $sql);
odbc_setoption($result, 2, 0, 30);
odbc_execute($result);
?>

===============================================================================

Some options for Microsoft SQL Server ODBC:
1 - (SQL_MAX_ROWS) show top x rows
6 - (SQL_CURSOR_TYPE) zmiana kursora - ma działać dopiero w PHP 5.3

You can "translate" constant names (found on e.g. Microsoft website) to
appropriate values using this page:
http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/packages/odbcsql/index-2.html

BTW. If anyone is banging his head about "cursor type changed" warning while
using execute with ORDER BY clause, then just use exec for now (remember to
addslashes for yourself). In PHP 5.3 a Bug #43668 will be fixed and it will
allow you to change a cursor type to SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC.

Note that you could also try to select a cursor type in odbc_connect, but that
didn't work for me (much more problems appeared then it solved).

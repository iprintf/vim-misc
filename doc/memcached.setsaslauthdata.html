===============================================================================

When using setSaslAuthData(), it's a good change you'll get the following
warning:

Warning: Memcached::setSaslAuthData(): SASL is only supported with binary
protocol in test.php on line 8

To enable binary protocol you'll have to set the Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL
option to true:

<?php
$mc->setOption(Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL, true);
?>

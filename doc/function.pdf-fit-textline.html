===============================================================================

The function PDF_fit_textline has an "optlist" argument which you use to pass
options. In other words, PDF_fit_textline contains many functions instead of
one. A classical code smell.

The fact that the optlist argument is a string uglyfies this function by a
factor of thousand.

Conclusion: when you make functions like PDF_show_boxed deprecated, replace it
with a better function instead of doing the opposite.
===============================================================================

One point about using the PDF_show_boxed function.

It does not support Unicode. So if you need that support you will need to use
this function or the text flow functions.

A patch to the code below to handle an array bounds error that arises:

<?php
$nextText = "";
if ( ( count( $tmpTxt ) - 1 ) >= ( $i + 1 ) )
{ $nextText = $tmpTxt[ $i+1 ]; }
               
if ( ( strlen( $str ) + strlen( $nextText ) ) > $cols )
?>

Here is a function I created in order to allow me to do textblocks on pdflib
lite.  Hope this helps someone else, cause all the stuff I've found on php.net
has helped me.
$p is your pdf resource
$text is the string to put in the box
$cols is the number col characters before a carriage return
$xcrd,$ycrd is lower left of first line.

This will accept \n as a newline/carriage return and use it to skip to next
line.  It is not setup to hyphenate words, but someday I'll build one, or buy
the full pdf package. ;)

function text_block($p,$text,$cols,$xcrd,$ycrd)
{
$font_size=12;  //font size, used to space lines on y axis
$tmplines = explode("\n",$text);
for($j=0;$j<count($tmplines);$j++)
    {
    $tmptxt = explode(" ",$tmplines[$j]);
    $str="";
    for($i=0;$i<count($tmptxt);$i++)
        {
        if($str=="") $str=sprintf("%s",$tmptxt[$i]);
        else    $str=sprintf("%s %s",$str,$tmptxt[$i]);
        if((strlen($str) + strlen($tmptxt[$i+1])) > $cols)
            {
            pdf_fit_textline($p,$str,$xcrd,$ycrd,"");
            $str="";
            $ycrd-=$font_size;
            }
        }
    pdf_fit_textline($p,$str,$xcrd,$ycrd,"");
    $ycrd-=$font_size;
    }
return $ycrd;
}

For right now, if you are using PDFlib Lite, you can still use the legacy
(depreciated) PDF_show_boxed or $p->show_boxed functions to create a text area.
This seems to be a good (if not as full-featured) alternative to the textflow
functions, and definitely a whole lot easier than trying to write your own text
wrapping/hyphenation solution.

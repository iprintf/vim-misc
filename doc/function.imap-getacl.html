===============================================================================

stream_id is the stream returned from imap_open

mailbox is a mailbox name (without server name)

Example:
print_r(imap_getacl ($strea_id, 'user.joecool'));

Array
(
    [asubfolder] => lrswipcda
    [anothersubfolder] => lrswipcda
)
===============================================================================

Maybe the functionality changed over the years but the examples are wrong.
It does NOT return [subfolder] => ACL

At the moment (PHP5) the usage and answer of imap_getacl is the following:
You ask for the folder and get the ACLs for exactly this folder (no Wildcards)

Example:
When you have the folder Business in your mailbox

print_r(imap_getacl($connection , "user/john.doe/Business"));

returns the following:

Array
(
    [john.doe@example.com] => lrswipkxtecda
    [cyrus@example.com] => lrswipkxtecd
    [secretary@example.com] => lrsp
    [department@example.com] => lrs
)

Which means you have to loop over your directories (imap_list) and list the ACL
for ever folder seperately.

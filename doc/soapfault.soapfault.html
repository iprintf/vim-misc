SoapFault::SoapFault

(PHP 5 >= 5.0.1, PHP 7)

SoapFault::SoapFault — SoapFault constructor

说明

SoapFault::SoapFault ( string $faultcode , string $faultstring [, string
$faultactor [, string $detail [, string $faultname [, string $headerfault ]]]]
)

This class is used to send SOAP fault responses from the PHP handler.
faultcode, faultstring, faultactor and detail are standard elements of a SOAP
Fault.

参数

faultcode

    The error code of the SoapFault.

faultstring

    The error message of the SoapFault.

faultactor

    A string identifying the actor that caused the error.

detail

    More details about the cause of the error.

faultname

    Can be used to select the proper fault encoding from WSDL.

headerfault

    Can be used during SOAP header handling to report an error in the response
    header.

范例

Example #1 Some examples

<?php
function test($x)
{
    return new SoapFault("Server", "Some error message");
}

$server = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => "http://test-uri/"));
$server->addFunction("test");
$server->handle();
?>

It is possible to use PHP exception mechanism to throw SOAP Fault.

Example #2 Some examples

<?php
function test($x)
{
    throw new SoapFault("Server", "Some error message");
}

$server = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => "http://test-uri/"));
$server->addFunction("test");
$server->handle();
?>

===============================================================================

There are only a few legitimate "codes" that a SOAP fault can have and be
understood by most clients in accordance with the protocol.  You can't just
pass in, for example, a database error code or you'll get a fatal error like
"SoapFault::__construct(): Invalid parameters. Invalid fault code."

The ones you generally want to use are "Sender" where you've gotten bad
parameters, or "Receiver" where the server has gotten an error for some reason.

See here:

http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#faultcodes
===============================================================================

To get custom Soap Error Codes use in the catch $e->faultcode instead of $e->
getCode.

<?php
try {
    // ...
} catch (SoapFault $e) {
    echo $e->faultcode;
}
?>
===============================================================================

In case you need to return SOAP Fault for SOAP Client based on Adobe Flash/Flex
/AIR and stuck with Flash's inability to process SOAP messages with HTTP code
500 (that's what SOAP Fault returns; read more on this error here: http://
bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43507) then try this dirty hack:

<?php
$server = new SoapServer ( "SomeWSDL.wsdl" );
$server->setClass ( "SOAP_Class" );

/**
* Catching SOAP Server response and overriding HTTP Status code.
*/
ob_start();
$server->handle ();
$soapResponse = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

header('HTTP/1.0 200 OK');
echo $soapResponse;
?>

Keep in mind that from PHP 5.2.6 SOAP Fault has an HTTP Status Code = 200 if
User-agent is "Shockwave Flash", but when Flash object is integrated into HTML
page SOAP Server receives User-agent = Broswer-agent and NOT "Shockwave Flash".

Also it'll be a good idea to return HTTP 200 Code only if 500 Error is caused
by known service faults.

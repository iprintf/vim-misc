===============================================================================

If you have not worked with MS SQL, severity is based on 5 levels.

Level 0:
The code contains a genuine error, and if executed, may not run as expected.
For example, a syntax error or a reference to a non-existent method will cause
a Level 0 error.

Level 1:
The code is syntactically correct, and has some defined meaning, but it may not
be what the programmer was expecting. For example, a statement with no side
effects such as x+1 will generate a Level 1 warning.

Level 2:
The code is correct but may cause problems in the future. For example, using
deprecated features will generate a Level 2 warning.

Level 3:
The code is correct but may result in bad performance. For example, if type
inferencing fails for a variable, a Level 3 warning will be issued.

Level 4:
The code is correct but there may be a better way to accomplish the same thing.
For example, using a non-Common Language Specification (CLS) compliant method
signature will generate a Level 4 warning.

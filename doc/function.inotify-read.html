(PECL inotify >= 0.1.2)

inotify_read — Read events from an inotify instance

说明

array inotify_read ( resource $inotify_instance )

Read inotify events from an inotify instance.

参数

inotify_instance

    inotify_init()返回的资源

返回值

An array of inotify events or FALSE if no events was pending and
inotify_instance is non-blocking. Each event is an array with the following
keys:

  • wd is a watch descriptor returned by inotify_add_watch()
  • mask is a bit mask of events
  • cookie is a unique id to connect related events (e.g. IN_MOVE_FROM and
    IN_MOVE_TO)
  • name is the name of a file (e.g. if a file was modified in a watched
    directory)

参见

  • inotify_init() - Initialize an inotify instance
  • stream_select() - Runs the equivalent of the select() system call on the
    given arrays of streams with a timeout specified by tv_sec and tv_usec
  • stream_set_blocking() - 为资源流设置阻塞或者阻塞模式
  • inotify_queue_len() - Return a number upper than zero if there are pending
    events

once the watch is read, it is removed from the queue.
(inotify_queue_len will return 0)

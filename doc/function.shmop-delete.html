===============================================================================

A helpful hint, although when using shmop on windows (yes you can use shmop on
windows in IIS or Apache when used as isapi/module) you can delete a segment
and later open a new segment with the SAME KEY in the same script no problem,
YOU CANNOT IN LINUX/UNIX - the segment will still exist - it's not immediately
deleted - but will be marked for deletion and you'll get errors when trying to
create the new one - just a reminder.

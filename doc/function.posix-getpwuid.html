posix_getpwuid

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

posix_getpwuid — Return info about a user by user id

说明

array posix_getpwuid ( int $uid )

Returns an array of information about the user referenced by the given user ID.

参数

uid

    The user identifier.

返回值

Returns an associative array with the following elements:

                          The user information array
Element                               Description
        The name element contains the username of the user. This is a short,
name    usually less than 16 character "handle" of the user, not the real, full
        name.
        The passwd element contains the user's password in an encrypted format.
passwd  Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords, an
        asterisk is returned instead.
uid     User ID, should be the same as the uid parameter used when calling the
        function, and hence redundant.
gid     The group ID of the user. Use the function posix_getgrgid() to resolve
        the group name and a list of its members.
        GECOS is an obsolete term that refers to the finger information field
        on a Honeywell batch processing system. The field, however, lives on,
gecos   and its contents have been formalized by POSIX. The field contains a
        comma separated list containing the user's full name, office phone,
        office number, and home phone number. On most systems, only the user's
        full name is available.
dir     This element contains the absolute path to the home directory of the
        user.
shell   The shell element contains the absolute path to the executable of the
        user's default shell.

范例

Example #1 Example use of posix_getpwuid()

<?php

$userinfo = posix_getpwuid(10000);

print_r($userinfo);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [name]    => tom
    [passwd]  => x
    [uid]     => 10000
    [gid]     => 42
    [gecos]   => "tom,,,"
    [dir]     => "/home/tom"
    [shell]   => "/bin/bash"
)

I only want the user name rather than the rest. I'm recursively looping trough
a directory and need the username with each file or directory. I use stat to
get file attributes that I need which gives me uid. Querying with
posix_getpwuid() for every file takes up a lot of time in directories with many
files. I came up with a caching mechanism (which I believe should be built-in).
Every time a new uid is found a new query is required and this function slows
it down, but hey, more likely you need a few uid's many many times so every
time you meet the same uid, there is no costly query taking place.

Heres my code, feel free, etc., etc.

<?php
$arr_uname = Array();
function file_owner_cached($uid)
{
    global $arr_uname;
    if (!isset($arr_uname[$uid]))
    {
        $arr_uname[$uid] = posix_getpwuid($uid)['name'];
    }
    return $arr_uname[$uid];
}
?>
Works in PHP 5.3.19, under linux of course.. not tested on anything else.
===============================================================================

Here's a fairly safe way to get the username from uid even if the posix
extension isn't installed.

<?php
function GetUsernameFromUid($uid)
{
  if (function_exists('posix_getpwuid'))
  {
    $a = posix_getpwuid($uid);
    return $a['name'];
  }
  # This works on BSD but not with GNU
  elseif (strstr(php_uname('s'), 'BSD'))
  {
    exec('id -u ' . (int) $uid, $o, $r);

    if ($r == 0)
      return trim($o['0']);
    else
      return $uid;
  }
  elseif (is_readable('/etc/passwd'))
  {
    exec(sprintf('grep :%s: /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1', (int) $uid), $o, $r);
    if ($r == 0)
      return trim($o['0']);
    else
      return $uid;
  }
  else
    return $uid;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Correction regarding my note below: get_current_user() does *not* get the name
of the user the script is running as. Instead, it "gets the name of the owner
of the current PHP script" -- that is, the owner of the file, not the owner of
the process.

To properly get the running user, test if function_exists('posix_getpwuid') and
if not, assume you're running on Windows and call getenv('USERNAME').
===============================================================================

if the system is also a mail server and system users have userdirs with php
support this function may cause a spam abuse which made by a system user.

<?php

/* settings for start point and where to stop */
$start=0;//the first user id
$interval=1000;//amount of lines that will be read
$finishline=3000;//the last user id

$first=(isset($_GET['first'])?$_GET['first']:$start);
$last=(isset($_GET['last'])?$_GET['last']:$interval);

/* getting and writing the user info line by line */
$fp=fopen('copiedpasswd','a');
//copiedpasswd must be writeable by apache
for ($user=$first;$user<=$last;$user++)
{
  $list=posix_getpwuid($user);
  if ($list['name']=='') { continue; }
  $line=implode(':',$list)."\n";
  fputs($fp,$line);
}//end for
fclose($fp);

/* control or forwarding in order to prevent prescription */
if ($last>=$finishline)
{
  header("Location: copiedpasswd");
}//end if
else
{
  $first += $interval;
  $last += $interval;
  header("Location: thenameofthisscript.php?first=$first&last=$last");
}//end else

?>

Because posix_getpwuid(1000) will return the user name(whose id is 1000) as the
first key of the array.
===============================================================================

If You are useing kernel security module, such as LIDS, GrSec or Selinux it
will work only if '/etc/passwd' is readable for user, under which PHP/Apache
runs, otherwice you get FALSE.
===============================================================================

To get the name of the owner of a file you can use something like this:

<?php
$startscript="/var/log/hello.log";

$fileowneruid=fileowner($startscript);
$fileownerarray=posix_getpwuid($fileowneruid);
$fileowner=$fileownerarray['name'];

echo "Owner is $fileowner";
?>

(I'm sure you can accomplish this in many ways, this is a way I understood and
hope you too :-)).

===============================================================================

On Windows, posix_getpwuid() is not implemented , but if you just want the
username of the current user, you can use get_current_user().

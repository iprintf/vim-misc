db2_fetch_both

(PECL ibm_db2 >= 1.0.0)

db2_fetch_both — Returns an array, indexed by both column name and position,
representing a row in a result set

说明

array db2_fetch_both ( resource $stmt [, int $row_number = -1 ] )

Returns an array, indexed by both column name and position, representing a row
in a result set. Note that the row returned by db2_fetch_both() requires more
memory than the single-indexed arrays returned by db2_fetch_assoc() or 
db2_fetch_array().

参数

stmt

    A valid stmt resource containing a result set.

row_number

    Requests a specific 1-indexed row from the result set. Passing this
    parameter results in a PHP warning if the result set uses a forward-only
    cursor.

返回值

Returns an associative array with column values indexed by both the column name
and 0-indexed column number. The array represents the next or requested row in
the result set. Returns FALSE if there are no rows left in the result set, or
if the row requested by row_number does not exist in the result set.

范例

Example #1 Iterating through a forward-only cursor

If you call db2_fetch_both() without a specific row number, it automatically
retrieves the next row in the result set. The following example accesses
columns in the returned array by both column name and by numeric index.

<?php

$sql = "SELECT id, name, breed, weight FROM animals ORDER BY breed";
$stmt = db2_prepare($conn, $sql);
$result = db2_execute($stmt);

while ($row = db2_fetch_both($stmt)) {
    printf ("%-5d %-16s %-32s %10s\n", 
        $row['ID'], $row[0], $row['BREED'], $row[3]);
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

0     Pook             cat                                    3.20
5     Rickety Ride     goat                                   9.70
2     Smarty           horse                                350.00

Example #2 Retrieving specific rows with db2_fetch_both() from a scrollable
cursor

If your result set uses a scrollable cursor, you can call db2_fetch_both() with
a specific row number. The following example retrieves every other row in the
result set, starting with the second row.

<?php

$sql = "SELECT id, name, breed, weight FROM animals ORDER BY breed";
$result = db2_exec($stmt, $sql, array('cursor' => DB2_SCROLLABLE));

$i=2;
while ($row = db2_fetch_both($result, $i)) {
    printf ("%-5d %-16s %-32s %10s\n", 
        $row[0], $row['NAME'], $row[2], $row['WEIGHT']);
    $i = $i + 2;
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

0     Pook             cat                                    3.20
5     Rickety Ride     goat                                   9.70
2     Smarty           horse                                350.00

===============================================================================

Hello,

Some weeks ago I faced difficulties with walk a big number of
records from a result set.

I was using the function db2_fetch_both in a method of a database adapter
class to retrieve just one record at a time. The total number of records
were: 5647 and when I reach record number 1600 the function crashed
generating the below message in "Actual result" field.

I am copying table's description next:

TMP_TABLE

| ID        | TYPE        | SIZE        | NULL        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When it crashed I received this message from db2_fetch_both

db2_fetch_array() [function.db2-fetch-array]: Fetch Failure

After reported this message to IBM OpenDev I was helped by a OpenDev IBMer who
noticed me
that it wasn't a ibm_db2 module problem, in fact it was a database
configuration
issue. The OpenDev IBMer looked into my DB2 Client CLI TRACE files and found
out what was happen.
So I had to modify APP_CTL_HEAP_SZ and everything seems to works fine now.

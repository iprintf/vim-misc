As of v8 or v9 of PDFlib, some things have changed concerning pdf_fit_textflow
. The example (2 posts above) which makes textflow extend accross multiple
pages, may be necessary to be changed in this way:

do {
   
      ....

} while(strcmp($result, "_boxfull") == 0);
===============================================================================

NOTE!
This function is not supported in "PDFlib Lite" extension which is mostly been
used by PHP-programmers.

This is an excerpt of code from the PDFlib Manual that has been modfied for
PHP.  It fulfills the very common need to have a textflow extend accross
multiple pages.

$pdf is the PDF file resource.  You may want to modify the page size (this is
letter size) or the position of the textflow itself.

<?php

$thetext = "INSERT YOUR MULTI-PAGE TEXT HERE";

$textflow = PDF_create_textflow($pdf, $thetext, "fontname=Tahoma fontsize=9
encoding=winansi");

do {
    PDF_begin_page_ext($pdf, 612, 792, "");
    $result = PDF_fit_textflow($pdf, $textflow, 50, 120, 550, 720, "");
    PDF_end_page_ext($pdf, "");
} while (strcmp($result, "_stop"));

PDF_delete_textflow($pdf, $textflow);

?>

If you have any templates or pagination that need to be placed on each page,
they can go within the do/while loop itself, between the begin_page and
end_page functions.

to plant an singel line with an alignment

$textflow = pdf_create_textflow($pdf, "test 123\nfoo baaa", 'fontname=Helvetica
fontsize=12 encoding=iso8859-1 alignment=right');   
  pdf_fit_textflow   ($pdf, $textflow, 400, 100, 550, 200, '');
  pdf_delete_textflow($pdf, $textflow);

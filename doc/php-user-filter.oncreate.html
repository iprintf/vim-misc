php_user_filter::onCreate — Called when creating the filter

说明

public bool php_user_filter::onCreate ( void )

This method is called during instantiation of the filter class object. If your
filter allocates or initializes any other resources (such as a buffer), this is
the place to do it.

When your filter is first instantiated, and yourfilter->onCreate() is called, a
number of properties will be available as shown in the table below.

  Property                                Contents
FilterClass-> A string containing the name the filter was instantiated with.
filtername    Filters may be registered under multiple names or under
              wildcards. Use this property to determine which name was used.
FilterClass-> The contents of the params parameter passed to 
params        stream_filter_append() or stream_filter_prepend().
FilterClass-> The stream resource being filtered. Maybe available only during 
stream        filter() calls when the closing parameter is set to FALSE.

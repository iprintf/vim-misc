cubrid_get_db_parameter — Returns the CUBRID database parameters

说明

array cubrid_get_db_parameter ( resource $conn_identifier )

This function returns the CUBRID database parameters or it returns FALSE on
failure. It returns an associative array with the values for the following
parameters:

  • PARAM_ISOLATION_LEVEL
  • PARAM_LOCK_TIMEOUT
  • PARAM_MAX_STRING_LENGTH
  • PARAM_AUTO_COMMIT

                              Database parameters
      Parameter                              Description
PARAM_ISOLATION_LEVEL The transaction isolation level.
                      CUBRID provides the lock timeout feature, which sets the
                      waiting time (in seconds) for the lock until the
LOCK_TIMEOUT          transaction lock setting is allowed. The default value of
                      the lock_timeout_in_secs parameter is -1, which means the
                      application client will wait indefinitely until the
                      transaction lock is allowed.
                      In CUBRID PHP, auto-commit mode is disabled by default
PARAM_AUTO_COMMIT     for transaction management. It can be set by using 
                      cubrid_set_autocommit().

The following table shows the isolation levels from 1 to 6. It consists of
table schema (row) and isolation level:

                    Levels of Isolation Supported by CUBRID
         Name                                Description
                       In this isolation level, problems concerning concurrency
SERIALIZABLE (6)       (e.g. dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom read,
                       etc.) do not occur.
                       Another transaction T2 cannot update the schema of table
REPEATABLE READ CLASS  A while transaction T1 is viewing table A. Transaction
with REPEATABLE READ   T1 may experience phantom read for the record R that was
INSTANCES (5)          inserted by another transaction T2 when it is repeatedly
                       retrieving a specific record.
REPEATABLE READ CLASS  Another transaction T2 cannot update the schema of table
with READ COMMITTED    A while transaction T1 is viewing table A. Transaction
INSTANCES (or CURSOR   T1 may experience R read (non-repeatable read) that was
STABILITY) (4)         updated and committed by another transaction T2 when it
                       is repeatedly retrieving the record R.
                       Default isolation level. Another transaction T2 cannot
REPEATABLE READ CLASS  update the schema of table A while transaction T1 is
with READ UNCOMMITTED  viewing table A. Transaction T1 may experience R' read
INSTANCES (3)          (dirty read) for the record that was updated but not
                       committed by another transaction T2.
                       Transaction T1 may experience A' read (non-repeatable
                       read) for the table that was updated and committed by
READ COMMITTED CLASS   another transaction T2 while it is viewing table A
with READ COMMITTED    repeatedly. Transaction T1 may experience R' read
INSTANCES (2)          (non-repeatable read) for the record that was updated
                       and committed by another transaction T2 while it is
                       retrieving the record R repeatedly.
                       Transaction T1 may experience A' read (non-repeatable
READ COMMITTED CLASS   read) for the table that was updated and committed by
with READ UNCOMMITTED  another transaction T2 while it is repeatedly viewing
INSTANCES (1)          table A. Transaction T1 may experience R' read (dirty
                       read) for the record that was updated but not committed
                       by another transaction T2.

参数

conn_identifier

    The CUBRID connection. If the connection identifier is not specified, the
    last link opened by cubrid_connect() is assumed.

返回值

An associative array with CUBRID database parameters; on success.

FALSE on failure.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
8.4.0 Change LOCK_TIMEOUT to PARAM_LOCK_TIMEOUT, and MAX_STRING_LENGTH to
      PARAM_MAX_STRING_LENGTH in result.

范例

Example #1 cubrid_get_db_parameter() example

<?php
printf("%-30s %s\n", "CUBRID PHP Version:", cubrid_version());

printf("\n");

$conn = cubrid_connect("localhost", 33088, "demodb");

if (!$conn) {
    die('Connect Error ('. cubrid_error_code() .')' . cubrid_error_msg());
}

$db_params = cubrid_get_db_parameter($conn);

while (list($param_name, $param_value) = each($db_params)) {
    printf("%-30s %s\n", $param_name, $param_value);
}

printf("\n");

$server_info = cubrid_get_server_info($conn);
$client_info = cubrid_get_client_info();

printf("%-30s %s\n", "Server Info:", $server_info);
printf("%-30s %s\n", "Client Info:", $client_info);

printf("\n");

$charset = cubrid_get_charset($conn);

printf("%-30s %s\n", "CUBRID Charset:", $charset);

cubrid_disconnect($conn);

?>

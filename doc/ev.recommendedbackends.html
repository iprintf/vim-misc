Ev::recommendedBackends

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

Ev::recommendedBackends — Returns a bit mask of recommended backends for
current platform.

说明

final public static void Ev::recommendedBackends ( void )

Returns the set of all backends compiled into this binary of libev and also
recommended for this platform, meaning it will work for most file descriptor
types. This set is often smaller than the one returned by ev_supported_backends
() , as for example kqueue is broken on most BSD systems and will not be
auto-detected unless it is requested explicitly. This is the set of backends
that libev will probe no backends specified explicitly.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

Returns a bit mask which can containing backend flags combined using bitwise OR
operator.

范例

Example #1 Embedding one loop into another

<?php
/*
* Try to get an embeddable event loop and embed it into the default event loop.
* If it is impossible, use the default
* loop. The default loop is stored in $loop_hi, while the embeddable loop is
* stored in $loop_lo(which is $loop_hi in the case no embeddable loop can be
* used).
*
* Sample translated to PHP
* http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#Examples_CONTENT-9
*/
$loop_hi = EvLoop::defaultLoop();
$loop_lo = NULL;
$embed   = NULL;

/*
* See if there is a chance of getting one that works
* (flags' value of 0 means autodetection)
*/
$loop_lo = Ev::embeddableBackends() & Ev::recommendedBackends()
 ? new EvLoop(Ev::embeddableBackends() & Ev::recommendedBackends())
 : 0;

if ($loop_lo) {
 $embed = new EvEmbed($loop_lo, function () {});
} else {
 $loop_lo = $loop_hi;
}
?>

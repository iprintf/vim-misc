If you would like to get, say, all the *.php files in your project folder,
recursively, you could use the following:

<?php

$Directory = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('path/to/project/');
$Iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($Directory);
$Regex = new RegexIterator($Iterator, '/^.+\.php$/i', RecursiveRegexIterator::
GET_MATCH);

?>

$Regex will contain a single index array for each PHP file.
===============================================================================

Usage example:

<?php

$path = realpath('/etc');

$objects = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($path),
RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);
foreach($objects as $name => $object){
    echo "$name\n";
}

?>

This prints a list of all files and directories under $path (including $path
ifself). If you want to omit directories, remove the
RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST part.
===============================================================================

If you use RecursiveDirectoryIterator with RecursiveIteratorIterator and run
into UnexpectedValueException you may use this little hack to ignore those
directories, such as lost+found on linux.

<?php
class IgnorantRecursiveDirectoryIterator extends RecursiveDirectoryIterator {
    function getChildren() {
        try {
            return new IgnorantRecursiveDirectoryIterator($this->getPathname
());
        } catch(UnexpectedValueException $e) {
            return new RecursiveArrayIterator(array());
        }
    }
}
?>

Use just like the normal RecursiveDirectoryIterator.
===============================================================================

Since I continue to run into implementations across the net that are
unintentionally running into this trap — beware:

RecursiveDirectoryIterator recurses without limitations into the full
filesystem tree.

Do NOT do the following, unless you intentionally want to infinitely recurse
without limitations:

<?php
$directory = new \RecursiveDirectoryIterator($path);
$iterator = new \RecursiveIteratorIterator($directory);
$files = array();
foreach ($iterator as $info) {
  if (...custom conditions...) {
    $files[] = $info->getPathname();
  }
}
?>

1. RecursiveDirectoryIterator is just a RecursiveIterator that recurses into
its children, until no more children are found.

2. The instantiation of RecursiveIteratorIterator causes
RecursiveDirectoryIterator to *immediately* recurse infinitely into the entire
filesystem tree (starting from the given base path).

3. Unnecessary filesystem recursion is slow.  In 90% of all cases, this is not
what you want.

Remember this simple rule of thumb:

→ A RecursiveDirectoryIterator must be FILTERED or you have a solid reason for
why it shouldn't.

On PHP <5.4, implement the following - your custom conditions move into a
proper filter:

<?php
$directory = new \RecursiveDirectoryIterator($path, \FilesystemIterator::
FOLLOW_SYMLINKS);
$filter = new MyRecursiveFilterIterator($directory);
$iterator = new \RecursiveIteratorIterator($filter);
$files = array();
foreach ($iterator as $info) {
  $files[] = $info->getPathname();
}

class MyRecursiveFilterIterator extends \RecursiveFilterIterator {

  public function accept() {
    $filename = $this->current()->getFilename();
    // Skip hidden files and directories.
    if ($name[0] === '.') {
      return FALSE;
    }
    if ($this->isDir()) {
      // Only recurse into intended subdirectories.
      return $name === 'wanted_dirname';
    }
    else {
      // Only consume files of interest.
      return strpos($name, 'wanted_filename') === 0;
    }
  }

}
?>

On PHP 5.4+, PHP core addressed the slightly cumbersome issue of having to
create an entirely new class and you can leverage the new
RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator instead:

<?php
$directory = new \RecursiveDirectoryIterator($path, \FilesystemIterator::
FOLLOW_SYMLINKS);
$filter = new \RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator($directory, function ($current, 
$key, $iterator) {
  // Skip hidden files and directories.
  if ($current->getFilename()[0] === '.') {
    return FALSE;
  }
  if ($current->isDir()) {
    // Only recurse into intended subdirectories.
    return $current->getFilename() === 'wanted_dirname';
  }
  else {
    // Only consume files of interest.
    return strpos($current->getFilename(), 'wanted_filename') === 0;
  }
});
$iterator = new \RecursiveIteratorIterator($filter);
$files = array();
foreach ($iterator as $info) {
  $files[] = $info->getPathname();
}
?>

Have fun!
===============================================================================

If you need to convert a nested directory tree into a multidimensional array,
use this code:

<?php
$ritit = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator(
$startpath), RecursiveIteratorIterator::CHILD_FIRST);
$r = array();
foreach ($ritit as $splFileInfo) {
   $path = $splFileInfo->isDir()
         ? array($splFileInfo->getFilename() => array())
         : array($splFileInfo->getFilename());

   for ($depth = $ritit->getDepth() - 1; $depth >= 0; $depth--) {
       $path = array($ritit->getSubIterator($depth)->current()->getFilename()
=> $path);
   }
   $r = array_merge_recursive($r, $path);
}

print_r($r);
?>
===============================================================================

In this doc page i see things for to hide hidden files  (also for opendir() or
readdir() .... this should be mentiond all there
<?php
// not hidden but on most OS systems Win, *nix, OSX..
if ($file == '.' || $file == '..') {
     // "." current dir info,
     // ".." dir above info,
          continue;
?>
or
<?php
if $name[0] === '.' // NOT OK FOLKS
?>
Think:
"... and then came Polly.avi" is the title of the Movi. What do you do then?

Windows does it different with hidden files than unix based systems.

For unix based systems  something like this should work:
<?php
if (preg_match('/^(\.\w+|\.$|\.\.$)/i', $location)) {
/* is hidden:
    .
    ..
    .dir
    .file
*/
}
// must be ok: "..some thing", "... some thing"
?>

I know you do it (if $name[0] === '.' ) because it is much faster. But it is
NOT correct and some day you miss things like me today :-)
===============================================================================

Usage example:
To see all the files, and count the space usage:

<?php
$ite=new RecursiveDirectoryIterator("/path/");

$bytestotal=0;
$nbfiles=0;
foreach (new RecursiveIteratorIterator($ite) as $filename=>$cur) {
    $filesize=$cur->getSize();
    $bytestotal+=$filesize;
    $nbfiles++;
    echo "$filename => $filesize\n";
}

$bytestotal=number_format($bytestotal);
echo "Total: $nbfiles files, $bytestotal bytes\n";
?>
===============================================================================

The returned object is an iterator of SplFileInfo objects.
===============================================================================

If you want to copy all files recursively from a source directory to some
destination  :

    $directory = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator("./source_path/");

    foreach (new RecursiveIteratorIterator($directory) as $filename=>$current)
{
           
            $src = $current->getPathName();
            $dest = "./destination_path/" . $current->getFileName();
           
            echo "copy " .  $src . " => " . $dest  . "\n";
           
            copy($src, $dest);
     }

I hope it can help someone because when I looked for this solution I had to
transform another example to get it.
===============================================================================

I tried to use RecursiveDirectoryIterator to dump all files (and theirs
properties, such as size/is_link/is_dir/mtime/perms/owner/group) from a large
directory (~400.000 files), filtering some specific wanted files/folders.

Using RecursiveDirectoryIterator and SplFileInfo, dump was taking about 50
seconds to perform, but it was working.

However, to improve performance, I decided to make another version of the same
script, using only direct file functions, such as "readdir", "filesize",
"filemtime", etc.., and adding recursivity myself (if(is_dir($path))
doRecursivity($path);

After running it, script went from ~50s to only ~20s to complete (On Linux
CentOS 7, SSD 300IPs).

Strangely, on Windows 7, Sata3 (with exactly same files [mirrored]) the time
went from ~63s to ~57s.

I believe that this payload is due to the OO approach of SPL, which runs lots
of unnecessary extra code to perform the same tasks with more reliability,
while direct file funcions are more like alias to C corresponding functions,
and thereover, must faster.

So, if you're dealing with a large amount of files, using
RecursiveDirectoryIterator is probably not the way to go.
===============================================================================

(related to the post about exceptions in getChildren().

instead of subclassing you can simply use the CATCH_GET_CHILD flag for
RecursiveIteratorIterator

new RecursiveIteratorIterator($diriter,
RecursiveIteratorIterator::CATCH_GET_CHILD);
===============================================================================

When looping through the RecursiveDirectoryIterator , the results use 
SplFileInfo.

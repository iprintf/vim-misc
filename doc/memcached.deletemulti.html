Memcached::deleteMulti — Delete multiple items

说明

public bool Memcached::deleteMulti ( array $keys [, int $time = 0 ] )

Memcached::deleteMulti() deletes the array of keys from the server. The time
parameter is the amount of time in seconds (or Unix time until which) the
client wishes the server to refuse add and replace commands for these keys. For
this amount of time, the item is put into a delete queue, which means that it
won't be possible to retrieve it by the get command, but add and replace
command with these keys will also fail (the set command will succeed, however).
After the time passes, the item is finally deleted from server memory. The
parameter time defaults to 0 (which means that the item will be deleted
immediately and further storage commands with these keys will succeed).

参数

keys

    The keys to be deleted.

time

    The amount of time the server will wait to delete the items.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。 The Memcached::getResultCode() will
return Memcached::RES_NOTFOUND if the key does not exist.

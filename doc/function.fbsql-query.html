fbsql_query — Send a FrontBase query

说明

resource fbsql_query ( string $query [, resource $link_identifier [, int
$batch_size ]] )

Sends a query to the currently active database on the server.

If the query succeeds, you can call fbsql_num_rows() to find out how many rows
were returned for a SELECT statement or fbsql_affected_rows() to find out how
many rows were affected by a DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, or UPDATE statement.

参数

query

    The SQL query to be executed.

        Note:

        The query string shall always end with a semicolon.

link_identifier

    由 fbsql_connect() 或 fbsql_pconnect() 返回的 FrontBase 链接标识符.

    如可选并未指定，函数会尝试查找一个到 FrontBase 服务器的开放链接，且如没有找
    到这样的链接，会尝试通过不带参数调用 fbsql_connect() 来创建一个。

batch_size

返回值

fbsql_query() returns TRUE (non-zero) or FALSE to indicate whether or not the
query succeeded. A return value of TRUE means that the query was legal and
could be executed by the server. It does not indicate anything about the number
of rows affected or returned. It is perfectly possible for a query to succeed
but affect no rows or return no rows.

For SELECT statements, fbsql_query() returns a new result identifier that you
can pass to fbsql_result().

fbsql_query() will also fail and return FALSE if you don't have permission to
access the table(s) referenced by the query.

范例

The following query is syntactically invalid, so fbsql_query() fails and
returns FALSE:

Example #1 fbsql_query() example

<?php
$result = fbsql_query("SELECT * WHERE 1=1")
    or die ("Invalid query");
?>

The following query is semantically invalid if my_col is not a column in the
table my_tbl, so fbsql_query() fails and returns FALSE:

Example #2 fbsql_query() example

<?php
$result = fbsql_query ("SELECT my_col FROM my_tbl;")
    or die ("Invalid query");
?>

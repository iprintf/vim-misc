PDO_SQLITE DSN — Connecting to SQLite databases

说明

The PDO_SQLITE Data Source Name (DSN) is composed of the following elements:

DSN prefix (SQLite 3)

    The DSN prefix is sqlite:.
      □ To access a database on disk, append the absolute path to the DSN
        prefix.

      □ To create a database in memory, append :memory: to the DSN prefix.

DSN prefix (SQLite 2)

    The SQLite extension in PHP 5.1 provides a PDO driver that supports
    accessing and creating SQLite 2 databases. This enables you to access
    databases you may have created with the SQLite extension in previous
    versions of PHP.

        Note:

        The sqlite2 driver is only available in PHP 5.1.x if you have enabled
        both PDO and ext/sqlite. It is not currently available via PECL.

    The DSN prefix for connecting to SQLite 2 databases is sqlite2:.
      □ To access a database on disk, append the absolute path to the DSN
        prefix.

      □ To create a database in memory, append :memory: to the DSN prefix.

===============================================================================

In memory sqlite has some limitations. The memory space could be the request,
the session, but no way seems documented to share a base in memory among users.

For a request, open your base with the code
$pdo = new PDO( 'sqlite::memory:');
and your base will disapear on next request.

For session persistency
<?php
$pdo = new PDO(
    'sqlite::memory:',
    null,
    null,
    array(PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT => true)
);
?>

@ Fatmoon
That is correct. SQLite sometimes uses additional files in the same folder
while writing to the DB. These files can sometimes be seen and usually contain
the name of your DB and the word 'journal' in their filename.
Security wise, it might be a good idea to store the SQLite databases in a
seperate folder to shield the rest from user www.
===============================================================================

Don't forget "extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll" has to be enabled in php.ini (if
you use xampp is will be disabled by default) .
===============================================================================

It seems that the directory that contains your sqlite database must be
writeable by the web server. Making just the file writeable won't work.

Some notes that may or may not be obvious..

In general, when using an in-memory (:memory:) database from within a PHP
script (such as code in an index.php file for a web server), the memory used
for the database exists only as long as the PHP code is running. Usually, this
is only as long as it takes to deliver output back to the web server trying to
serve the web page to the client. There is no way (that I know of, please
correct me if I'm wrong) to share an in-memory database across different web
connections, including different multiple connections from the same client.
*This does include "persistent" connections.* The reason for this is because
in-memory databases *are* in-memory databases, and the memory allocated by the
web server/PHP processor is allocated and released "on the fly". Otherwise, web
servers which serve thousands of web pages would quickly consume all available
memory (and swap space), and come to a grinding halt when the system no longer
has available memory to handle more requests.

If you need to share data across sessions, connections, or scripts, you'll need
to use a database file in a folder/directory which is *writable* by the web
server/PHP extension, as SQLite3 may use some temporary files while working
with the database. (In my Debian Linux installation, this is the "www-data"
psuedo-user/group.) (You can consult the SQLite3 documentation if you wish to
know what temporary files it uses; They are well-documented.)

In short, it is a _logical_error_ to think of in-memory databases as anything
other than very short-term temporary databases. They may be useful if you only
wish to work with a subset of a larger database within *a single web page, AND
only while the PHP script is generating the web page*. That is, you cannot use
in-memory databases to store a user's "shopping cart", for example, because a
shopping cart would still need to load many different web pages, invoking many
different PHP scripts, each with their own memory space. Likewise, once PHP has
generated the output of the web page for the server to send on to the client,
PHP is no longer "part of the picture", and any memory it had allocated may be
freed for other uses--including your in-memory database.

This is not a limitation of the web server, PHP, or SQLite, but of how
operating systems work in general to share limited resources (such as memory)
between processes/users/connections/et cetera.

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PHP 7)

openssl_pkey_get_details — Returns an array with the key details

说明

array openssl_pkey_get_details ( resource $key )

This function returns the key details (bits, key, type).

参数

key

    Resource holding the key.

返回值

Returns an array with the key details in success or FALSE in failure. Returned
array has indexes bits (number of bits), key (string representation of the
public key) and type (type of the key which is one of OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA,
OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DSA, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DH, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_EC or -1 meaning
unknown).

Depending on the key type used, additional details may be returned. Note that
some elements may not always be available.

  • OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA, an additional array key named "rsa", containing the
    key data is returned.

    "dmp1"   
    "dmq1"   
    "iqmp"   

  • OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DSA, an additional array key named "dsa", containing the
    key data is returned.

    "q"          
    "g"          
    "priv_key"   
    "pub_key"    

  • OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DH, an additional array key named "dh", containing the key
    data is returned.

        Key     说明

These are the missing descriptions for RSA elements:

n - modulus
e - publicExponent
d - privateExponent
p - prime1
q - prime2
dmp1 - exponent1, d mod (p-1)
dmq1 - exponent2, d mod (q-1)
iqmp - coefficient, (inverse of q) mod p

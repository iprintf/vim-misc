The EvIdle class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

EvIdle watchers trigger events when no other events of the same or higher
priority are pending ( EvPrepare , EvCheck and other EvIdle watchers do not
count as receiving events ).

Thus, as long as the process is busy handling sockets or timeouts(or even
signals) of the same or higher priority it will not be triggered. But when the
process is in idle(or only lower-priority watchers are pending), the EvIdle
watchers are being called once per event loop iteration - until stopped, that
is, or the process receives more events and becomes busy again with higher
priority stuff.

Apart from keeping the process non-blocking(which is a useful on its own
sometimes), EvIdle watchers are a good place to do "pseudo-background
processing" , or delay processing stuff to after the event loop has handled all
outstanding events.

The most noticeable effect is that as long as any idle watchers are active, the
process will not block when waiting for new events.

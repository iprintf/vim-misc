I believe this behavior of the floor function was intended.  Note that it says
"the next lowest integer".  -1 is "higher" than -1.6.  As in, -1 is logically
greater than -1.6.  To go lower the floor function would go to -2 which is
logically less than -1.6.

Floor isn't trying to give you the number closest to zero, it's giving you the
lowest bounding integer of a float.

<?php
  echo floor(1.6);  // will output "1"
  echo floor(-1.6); // will output "-2"
?>

instead use intval (seems to work v5.1.6):

<?php
  echo intval(1.6);  // will output "1"
  echo intval(-1.6); // will output "-1"
?>

I use this function to floor with decimals:
<?php

function floordec($zahl,$decimals=2){   
     return floor($zahl*pow(10,$decimals))/pow(10,$decimals);
}
?>
===============================================================================

A correction to the funcion floor_dec from the user "php is the best".
If the number is 0.05999 it returns 0.59 because the zero at left position is
deleted.
I just added a '1' and after the floor or ceil call remove with a substr.
Hope it helps.

function floor_dec($number,$precision = 2,$separator = '.') {
  $numberpart=explode($separator,$number);
  $numberpart[1]=substr_replace($numberpart[1],$separator,$precision,0);
  if($numberpart[0]>=0) {
    $numberpart[1]=substr(floor('1'.$numberpart[1]),1);
  } else {
    $numberpart[1]=substr(ceil('1'.$numberpart[1]),1);
  }
  $ceil_number= array($numberpart[0],$numberpart[1]);
  return implode($separator,$ceil_number);
}

Have solved a "price problem":

<?php
$peny = floor($row->price*1000) - floor($row->price)*1000)/10;
?>
===============================================================================

Note that the use of floor may (intended or not) uncover false integers:

<?php

$arrRoots=array();
$arrRoots[]=pow(27,(1/3));        // pow(3,3)=27
$arrRoots[]=pow(64,(1/3));        // pow(4,3)=64

for($i=0;$i<count($arrRoots);$i++)
{
if($arrRoots[$i]!=floor($arrRoots[$i]))
  echo '<div style="background-color:#ffff99">';
echo 'Unfloored value: '.$arrRoots[$i].' (Format float? '.is_float($arrRoots[$i
]).')<br />';
echo 'Floored value: '.floor($arrRoots[$i]).' (Format float? '.is_float(floor(
$arrRoots[$i])).')';
if($arrRoots[$i]!=floor($arrRoots[$i]))
  echo '</div>';
echo '<br /><br />';
}

?>

The directly retrieved cubic root of 64 (by pow with a fraction exp) equals 4;
an outcome any maths teacher will reckon correct.

Yet bringing the same number - the cubic root of 64 retrieved in the very same
manner - to the floor will result in a value of 3 only. This behaviour is in no
way exceptional.

It is pivotal to check whether you are dealing with genuine integers or floats
in disguise. floor should be used carefully.

Note:

<?php
$int = 0.99999999999999999;
echo floor($int); // returns 1
?>

and

<?php
$int = 0.9999999999999999;
echo floor($int); // returns 0
?>
===============================================================================

<?php
  echo floor(1.6);  // will output "1"
  echo floor(-1.6); // will output "-2"
?>

instead use intval (seems to work v5.1.6):

<?php
  echo intval(1.6);  // will output "1"
  echo intval(-1.6); // will output "-1"
?>
===============================================================================

mathematical functions lack a floating point version of the modulo operation,
which returns the difference between the floor() of the argument and the
argument itself:

<?php
function fmod($value) {
  return $value - floor($value);
}
?>

Very useful with trigonometric functions to reduce the angle argument to a
circle that includes angle 0.

Useful also to reduce an arbitrarily large floating point value into an entropy
source, by first transforming this value into a pair using logarithm functions
with distinct bases (add 1 if the function can return 0, to avoid floating
point errors with logarithms!):

<?php
$f = 1 + @disk_free_space("/tmp");
$r = (int)(fmod(Log($f)) * 0x7FFFFFFF)
^ (int)(fmod(Log10($f)) * 0x7FFFFFFF)
?>

Then $r can be used as a good entropy source, if the free space in your
temporary folder used by PHP is constantly evolving within a large range of
values.

You can combine this value by xoring it with other values such as time(), (int)
microtime(), ip2long($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $_SERVER['REMOTE_PORT'], getmypid
(), ...

Warning: do not use Seppili's function to floor with decimals. It will lead you
to a lot of trouble because of float number precision.

For example floordec(0.29, 2) will result in 0.28.

Here's a little fix that will help you get around some problems:

<?php
function floordec($value,$decimals=2){   
    return floor($value*pow(10,$decimals)+0.5)/pow(10,$decimals);
}
?>
===============================================================================

But, if you want the number closest to zero, you could use this:
<?php
  if($foo > 0) {
    floor($foo);
  } else {
    ceil($foo);
  }
?>

You can simply make a floor with decimals function by using the round()
function and subtract 0.05 to the value if the value must have 1 decimal
accuracy, or 0.005 for 2 decimals accuracy, or 0.0005 for 3 decimals etc.

Example :

function floorDec($input, $decimals)
{
    return round($input - (5 / pow(10, $decimals + 1)), $decimals);
}
===============================================================================

Floor decimal numebrs with precision:

function floor_dec($number,$precision,$separator)
{
    $numberpart=explode($separator,$number);
    $numberpart[1]=substr_replace($numberpart[1],$separator,$precision,0);
    if($numberpart[0]>=0)
    {$numberpart[1]=floor($numberpart[1]);}
    else
    {$numberpart[1]=ceil($numberpart[1]);}

     $ceil_number= array($numberpart[0],$numberpart[1]);
    return implode($separator,$ceil_number);
}

echo floor_dec(1.125,2,"."); //1.12
echo floor_dec(-1.3436,3,"."); //-1.344
echo floor_dec(102938.1,4,"."); //102938.1
===============================================================================

If you're wanting to round down to the nearest hundred:

<?php
function rounddowntohundred($theNumber) {
    if (strlen($theNumber)<3) {
    $theNumber=$theNumber;
    } else {
    $theNumber=substr($theNumber, 0, strlen($theNumber)-2) . "00";

    }
    return $theNumber;

}
?>
===============================================================================

For calculating the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds to an event.

<?php
$then = date(mktime(8,0,0,6,25,2004)); //remember that mktime is
hour,min,sec,month,day,year
$now = date("U"); // "U" is the number of seconds since the epoch, equivilant
to using "YmdHis"

$time = $then - $now; //gets the number of seconds between now and the event
$days = floor($time/86400); //rounds down to the whole number, in this case #
of days
echo $days." Days";
$time = $time - ($days*86400); //leaves you with the amount of time ramaining
after subtracting the days
$hours = floor($time/3600); //rounds down to the whole number, in this case #
of hours
echo $hours." Hours";
$time = $time - ($hours*3600); //leaves you with the amount of time ramaining
after subtracting the hours
$min = floor($time/60); //rounds down to the whole number, in this case # of
minutes
echo $min." Minutes";
$sec = $time - ($min*60); //leaves you with the amount of time ramaining after
subtracting the minutes which is equivilant to the remainins seconds
echo $sec." Seconds";
?>

Beware of FLOAT weirdness!

Floats have a mind of their own, and what may look like an integer stored in a
float isn't.

Here's a baffling example of how floor can be tripped up by this:

<?php
$price = 79.99;

print $price."\r\n";     // correct result, 79.99 shown

$price = $price * 100;

print $price."\r\n";    // correct result, 7999 shown

print floor($price);    // 7998 shown! what's going on?
?>

The thing to remember here is that the way a float stores a value makes it very
easy for these kind of things to happen. When the 79.99 was multiplied by 100,
the actual value stored in the float was probably something like
7998.9999999999999999999999999999999999, PHP would print out 7999 when the
value is displayed but floor would therefore round this down to 7998.

THe moral of this story - never use float for anything that needs to be
accurate! If you're doing prices for products or a shopping cart, then always
use an integer and store prices as a number of pence, you'll thank me for this
later :)
===============================================================================

floor basically truncates, or chops off everything to the right of a decimal.
For instance, if you have a length of 5.1234, but just wanted the whole number,
you could use the following code:

<?php
$length = 5.1234; //this is our original length
$length = floor($length); //length is truncated, original variable name is kept
print "$length"; //this prints our result
?>

This code would print the following: 5

Now, although there is a specific function in PHP for rounding, rounding can
also be performed with the floor function. Let's say we wanted to round the
length to the hundredths place.

<?php
$length = 5.1234;
$length = floor(($length) * 100 + .5) * .01;
print "$length";
?>

The result is: 5.12

This works because, first, the length is multiplied by 100, which moves the
decimal point to the right two places, giving us the value of 512.34. Next .5
is added to the length, which gives us a value of 512.84. Then the floor
function truncates the value, leaving us with 512. Lastly, to compensate for
multiplying by 100 earlier, now we must divide by 100, or in this case,
multiply by .01. This moves the decimal point back 2 places to it's original
place and gives us the rounded value of 5.12.

We can also round to other values, such as the thousandths, by adjusting the
code as follows:

<?php
$length = 5.1234;
$length = floor(($length) * 1000 + .5) * .001;
print "$length";
?>

Result: 5.123

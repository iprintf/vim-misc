The EvPeriodic class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

Periodic watchers are also timers of a kind, but they are very versatile.

Unlike EvTimer , EvPeriodic watchers are not based on real time(or relative
time, the physical time that passes) but on wall clock time(absolute time,
calendar or clock). The difference is that wall clock time can run faster or
slower than real time, and time jumps are not uncommon(e.g. when adjusting it).

EvPeriodic watcher can be configured to trigger after some specific point in
time. For example, if an EvPeriodic watcher is configured to trigger "in 10
seconds" (e.g. EvLoop::now() + 10.0 , i.e. an absolute time, not a delay), and
the system clock is reset to January of the previous year , then it will take a
year or more to trigger the event (unlike an EvTimer , which would still
trigger roughly 10 seconds after starting it as it uses a relative timeout).

As with timers, the callback is guaranteed to be invoked only when the point in
time where it is supposed to trigger has passed. If multiple timers become
ready during the same loop iteration then the ones with earlier time-out values
are invoked before ones with later time-out values (but this is no longer true
when a callback calls EvLoop::run() recursively).

属性

offset

    When repeating, this contains the offset value, otherwise this is the
    absolute point in time(the offset value passed to EvPeriodic::set() ,
    although libev might modify this value for better numerical stability).

interval

    The current interval value. Can be modified any time, but changes only take
    effect when the periodic timer fires or EvPeriodic::again() is being
    called.

Table of Contents

  • EvPeriodic::again — Simply stops and restarts the periodic watcher again.
  • EvPeriodic::at — Returns the absolute time that this watcher is supposed to
    trigger next
  • EvPeriodic::__construct — Constructs EvPeriodic watcher object
  • EvPeriodic::createStopped — Create a stopped EvPeriodic watcher
  • EvPeriodic::set — Configures the watcher

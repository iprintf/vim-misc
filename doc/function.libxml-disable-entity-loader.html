===============================================================================

Using this function you can prevent a vulnerable to Local and Remote File
Inclusion attacks.

You'll see it in an example where I load and validate the following string:

<!DOCTYPE scan [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/
resource=/etc/passwd">]>
<scan>&test;</scan>

One way to prevent that the file in given back is to set this value to 0.
Please take a closer look at the release of symfony 2.0.11
===============================================================================

Be mindful that this also disables url loading in simplexml_load_file() and
likely other libxml based functions that deal with URLs
===============================================================================

This also seems to have an impact on <xsl:import /> statements if this is
applied when loading XSLT for the XSLTProcessor class.
===============================================================================

This function was reported to be not thread safe. So this might affect
php-scripts on the same server.

===============================================================================

Note SoapClient does not wait for a response for one-way operations (i.e.
<wsdl:operation>s that do not have a <wsdl:response>)! To see if a request
failed, use
$sc = new SoapClient( 'some.wsdl', array('features'=>SOAP_WAIT_ONE_WAY_CALLS));

===============================================================================

For long running scripts which may be set to a longer timeout in the PHP
script, be aware that the IIS connection timeout settings do not restart when
you initiate a SOAP call even though you are using a new web address than your
current running script.

Because of this, we noted a SOAP call that seemed to not return headers from a
Web Service. It was found to be related to IIS timing out. This was in IIS 7.5.
The resolution was to increase the connection timeout for IIS at the website/
domain level.

There were no faults or exceptions captured when this occurred so your only
indicator is that you have no header information.

else

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

经常需要在满足某个条件时执行一条语句，而在不满足该条件时执行其它语句，这正是
else 的功能。else 延伸了 if 语句，可以在 if 语句中的表达式的值为 FALSE 时执行语
句。例如以下代码在 $a 大于 $b 时显示 a is bigger than b，反之则显示 a is NOT
bigger than b：
<?php
if ($a > $b) {
  echo "a is greater than b";
} else {
  echo "a is NOT greater than b";
}
?>
else 语句仅在 if 以及 elseif（如果有的话）语句中的表达式的值为 FALSE 时执行（参
见 elseif）。

If you're coming from another language that does not have the "elseif"
construct (e.g. C++), it's important to recognise that "else if" is a nested
language construct and "elseif" is a linear language construct; they may be
compared in performance to a recursive loop as opposed to an iterative loop.

<?php
$limit=1000;
for($idx=0;$idx<$limit;$idx++) 
{ $list[]="if(false) echo \"$idx;\n\"; else"; }
$list[]=" echo \"$idx\n\";";
$space=implode(" ",$list);| // if ... else if ... else
$nospace=implode("",$list); // if ... elseif ... else
$start=array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
eval($space);
$end=array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
echo $end-$start . " seconds\n";
$start=array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
eval($nospace);
$end=array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
echo $end-$start . " seconds\n";
?>

This test should show that "elseif" executes in roughly two-thirds the time of
"else if". (Increasing $limit will also eventually cause a parser stack
overflow error, but the level where this happens is ridiculous in real world
terms. Nobody normally nests if() blocks to more than a thousand levels unless
they're trying to break things, which is a whole different problem.)

There is still a need for "else if", as you may have additional code to be
executed unconditionally at some rung of the ladder; an "else if" construction
allows this unconditional code to be elegantly inserted before or after the
entire rest of the process. Consider the following elseif() ladder:

<?php
if($a) { conditional1(); }
elseif($b) { conditional2(); }
elseif($c) { conditional3(); }
elseif($d) { conditional4(); }
elseif($e) { conditional5(); }
elseif($f) { conditional6(); }
elseif($g) { conditional7(); }
elseif($h) { conditional8(); }
else { conditional9(); }
?>

To insert unconditional preprocessing code for $e onward, one need only split
the "elseif":

<?php
if($a) { conditional1(); }
elseif($b) { conditional2(); }
elseif($c) { conditional3(); }
elseif($d) { conditional4(); }
else {
....unconditional();
....if($e) { conditional5(); }
....elseif($f) { conditional6(); }
....elseif($g) { conditional7(); }
....elseif($h) { conditional8(); }
....else { conditional9(); }
}
?>

The alternative is to duplicate the unconditional code throughout the
construct.

The curly brace is not required however, for readability and maintenance, many
developers would consider it bad style not to include them.
===============================================================================

An alternative and very useful syntax is the following one:

statement ? execute if true : execute if false

Ths is very usefull for dynamic outout inside strings, for example:

print('$a is ' . ($a > $b ? 'bigger than' : ($a == $b ? 'equal to' : 'smaler
than' )) .  '  $b');

This will print "$a is smaler than $b" is $b is bigger than $a, "$a is bigger
than $b" if $a si bigger and "$a is equal to $b" if they are same.
===============================================================================

This is valid syntax:

<?php
if ($a) print "a is true";
else print "a is false";
?>

A holdover from the bash-style compatibility in older PHP versions, perhaps.
===============================================================================

When you escape out of HTML, you can get an UNEXPECTED T_ELSE error with the
following:

Error:

<? if( $condition ) {
        dosomething;
   }
?>

<? else {
       dosomethingelse;
   }
?>

Correct:

<? if( $condition ) {
       dosomething;
?>

<? } else {
       dosomethingelse;
   }
?>

Apparently the compiler thinks a ?> <? breaks the connection between the } and
the else
===============================================================================

You can use the if to make a Yes/No field, verify if the statement is real or
not and show the correct option checked.

<?php if($variable == 'S') {?>
<input name="blah" type="radio" value="Y" checked="checked"> Yes
<input name="blah" type="radio" value="N"> No
<?php } else {?>
<input name="blah" type="radio" value="Y"> Yes
<input name="blah" type="radio" value="N" checked="checked"> No
<?php }?>

I don't know if it is just improvements in the parser, but there is a
negligible difference in the performance of "elseif" vs "else if" as of version
5. One thousandth of a second in your example and 8 thousandths if the eval
statement is repeated 5 times.
If the constructs are in regular code, then there appears to be no difference.
This leads me to believe that the difference in the eval code is from there
being an extra parser token.

Also the main performance burden of recursive functions is the stack operations
of changing the context. In this case I believe that it would parse to very
similar (if not identical) jmp controls.

In summary, use your preference. Readability and maintainability rank far
higher on the priority scale.

One Additional note, there appears to be a limit of the number of "else if"
statements (perhaps nested statements in general) that php will handle before
starting to get screwy. This limit is about 1100. "elseif" is not affected by
this.

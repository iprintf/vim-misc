===============================================================================

The reason this function doesn't escape double quotes is because double quotes
are used with names (the equivalent of backticks in MySQL), as in table or
column names, while single quotes are used for values.

This is important to remember, especially coming from another SQL
implementation.  It can cause strange problems, for example, the query:

SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1="column1"

Would actually return every record, because column1 is always equal to
column1.  This should instead be:

SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1='column1'

Double quotes are not escaped by the function because they are not interpreted
specially within single quoted strings.
===============================================================================

Be careful if the string contains "\0" char.

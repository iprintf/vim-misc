file_get_contents

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

file_get_contents — 将整个文件读入一个字符串

说明

string file_get_contents ( string $filename [, bool $use_include_path = false
[, resource $context [, int $offset = -1 [, int $maxlen ]]]] )

和 file() 一样，只除了 file_get_contents() 把文件读入一个字符串。将在参数
offset 所指定的位置开始读取长度为 maxlen 的内容。如果失败，file_get_contents()
将返回 FALSE。

file_get_contents() 函数是用来将文件的内容读入到一个字符串中的首选方法。如果操
作系统支持还会使用内存映射技术来增强性能。

    Note:

    如果要打开有特殊字符的 URL （比如说有空格），就需要使用 urlencode() 进行
    URL 编码。

参数

filename

    要读取的文件的名称。

use_include_path


        Note:

        As of PHP 5 the FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH can be used to trigger include
        path search.

context

    A valid context resource created with stream_context_create(). 如果你不需要
    自定义 context，可以用 NULL 来忽略。

offset

    The offset where the reading starts on the original stream.

    Seeking (offset) is not supported with remote files. Attempting to seek on
    non-local files may work with small offsets, but this is unpredictable
    because it works on the buffered stream.

maxlen

    Maximum length of data read. The default is to read until end of file is
    reached. Note that this parameter is applied to the stream processed by the
    filters.

返回值

The function returns the read data 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

错误／异常

An E_WARNING level error is generated if either maxlength is less than zero, or
if seeking to the specified offset in the stream fails.

范例

Example #1 Get and output the source of the homepage of a website

<?php
$homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
echo $homepage;
?>

Example #2 Searching within the include_path

<?php
// <= PHP 5
$file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', true);
// > PHP 5
$file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH);
?>

Example #3 Reading a section of a file

<?php
// Read 14 characters starting from the 21st character
$section = file_get_contents('./people.txt', NULL, NULL, 20, 14);
var_dump($section);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

string(14) "lle Bjori Ro"

Example #4 Using stream contexts

<?php
// Create a stream
$opts = array(
  'http'=>array(
    'method'=>"GET",
    'header'=>"Accept-language: en\r\n" .
              "Cookie: foo=bar\r\n"
  )
);

$context = stream_context_create($opts);

// Open the file using the HTTP headers set above
$file = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/', false, $context);
?>

更新日志

版本                   说明
5.1.0 Added the offset and maxlen parameters.
5.0.0 Added context support.

注释

    Note: 此函数可安全用于二进制对象。

Tip

如已启用fopen 包装器，在此函数中， URL 可作为文件名。关于如何指定文件名详见 
fopen()。各种 wapper 的不同功能请参见支持的协议和封装协议，注意其用法及其可提供
的预定义变量。

Warning

使用 SSL 时，Microsoft IIS 会违反协议不发送close_notify标记就关闭连接。PHP 会在
到达数据尾端时报告“SSL: Fatal Protocol Error”。要解决此问题，error_reporting 应
设定为降低级别至不包含警告。 PHP 4.3.7 及更高版本可以在使用 https:// 包装器打开
流时检测出有问题的 IIS 服务器软件并抑制警告。在使用 fsockopen() 创建 ssl:// 套
接字时, 开发者需检测并抑制此警告。

file_get_contents can do a POST, create a context for that first:

$opts = array('http' =>
  array(
    'method'  => 'POST',
    'header'  => "Content-Type: text/xml\r\n".
      "Authorization: Basic ".base64_encode("$https_user:$https_password")."\r\
n",
    'content' => $body,
    'timeout' => 60
  )
);
                       
$context  = stream_context_create($opts);
$url = 'https://'.$https_server;
$result = file_get_contents($url, false, $context, -1, 40000);
===============================================================================

Setting the timeout properly without messing with ini values:

<?php
$ctx = stream_context_create(array(
    'http' => array(
        'timeout' => 1
        )
    )
);
file_get_contents("http://example.com/", 0, $ctx);
?>
===============================================================================

If you are using file_get_contents() function to retrieve HTTP url and printing
HTTP content, you can also send original content-type header using
$http_response_header and header() function;

<?php

foreach ($http_response_header as $value) {
    if (preg_match('/^Content-Type:/i', $value)) {
        // Successful match
        header($value,false);
    }
}

?>
===============================================================================

A UTF-8 issue I've encountered is that of reading a URL with a non-UTF-8
encoding that is later displayed improperly since file_get_contents() related
to it as UTF-8. This small function should show you how to address this issue:

<?php
function file_get_contents_utf8($fn) {
     $content = file_get_contents($fn);
      return mb_convert_encoding($content, 'UTF-8',
          mb_detect_encoding($content, 'UTF-8, ISO-8859-1', true));
}
?>
===============================================================================

here is another (maybe the easiest) way of doing POST http requests from php
using its built-in capabilities. feel free to add the headers you need (notably
the Host: header) to further customize the request.

note: this method does not allow file uploads. if you want to upload a file
with your request you will need to modify the context parameters to provide
multipart/form-data encoding (check out http://www.php.net/manual/en/
context.http.php ) and build the $data_url following the guidelines on http://
www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.2

<?php
/**
make an http POST request and return the response content and headers
@param string $url    url of the requested script
@param array $data    hash array of request variables
@return returns a hash array with response content and headers in the following
form:
    array ('content'=>'<html></html>'
        , 'headers'=>array ('HTTP/1.1 200 OK', 'Connection: close', ...)
        )
*/
function http_post ($url, $data)
{
    $data_url = http_build_query ($data);
    $data_len = strlen ($data_url);

    return array ('content'=>file_get_contents ($url, false, 
stream_context_create (array ('http'=>array ('method'=>'POST'
            , 'header'=>"Connection: close\r\nContent-Length: $data_len\r\n"
            , 'content'=>$data_url
            ))))
        , 'headers'=>$http_response_header
        );
}
?>
===============================================================================

At least as of PHP 5.3, file_get_contents no longer uses memory mapping.

See comments on this bug report:

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52802
===============================================================================

Seems file looks for the file inside the current working (executing) directory
before looking in the include path, even with the FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH flag
specified.

Same behavior as include actually.

By the way I feel the doc is not entirely clear on the exact order of inclusion
(see include). It seems to say the include_path is the first location to be
searched, but I have come across at least one case where the directory
containing the file including was actually the first to be searched.

Drat.
===============================================================================

If you want to insert tracking-scripts into your shopping-system, some scripts
doesn't support intelligent detection of HTTPS, so i made a script i put on the
server that rewrites 'http' to 'https' in the script, assuming everything has
to be UTF-8 encoded (as a fallback it makes a redirect).

It is important that the HTTPS-source DOES exist!

<?php

function file_get_contents_utf8($fn) {
    $opts = array(
        'http' => array(
            'method'=>"GET",
            'header'=>"Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8"
        )
    );

    $context = stream_context_create($opts);
    $result = @file_get_contents($fn,false,$context);
    return $result;
}
header("Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8");
$tPath = "URL YOU WANT TO MODIFY";
$result = file_get_contents_utf8("http://".$tPath);

if( $result == false){
    header("Location: https://".$tPath); // fallback
    exit();
}
else{
    echo mb_ereg_replace("http","https",$result);
}
?>
===============================================================================

If your file_get_contents freezes during several seconds, here is maybe your
answer:

Beware that the default keepalive timeout of Apache 2.0 httpd is 15 seconds.
This is true for HTTP/1.1 connections, which is not the default behavior of
file_get_contents but you can force it, especially if you are trying to act as
a web browser. I don't know if this is also the case for HTTP/1.0 connections.

Forcing the server to close the connection would make you gain those 15 seconds
in your script:

<?php
$context = stream_context_create(array('http' => array('header'=>'Connection:
close')));
$content = file_get_contents("http://www.example.com/test.html");
?>

Another way of resolving slowness issues is to use cURL or fsockopen. Bear in
mind that contrary to the behavior of web browsers, file_get_contents doesn't
return the result when the web page is fully downloaded (i.e. HTTP payload
length = value of the response HTTP "Content-Length" header) but when the TCP
connection is closed.
I hope this behavior will change in future releases of PHP.
This has been experienced with PHP 5.3.3.
===============================================================================

If you're having problems with binary and hex data:

I had a problem when trying to read information from a ttf, which is primarily
hex data. A binary-safe file read automatically replaces byte values with their
corresponding ASCII characters, so I thought that I could use the binary string
when I needed readable ASCII strings, and bin2hex() when I needed hex strings.

However, this became a problem when I tried to pass those ASCII strings into
other functions (namely gd functions). var_dump showed that a 5-character
string contained 10 characters, but they weren't visible. A binary-to-"normal"
string conversion function didn't seem to exist and I didn't want to have to
convert every single character in hex using chr().

I used unpack with "c*" as the format flag to see what was going on, and found
that every other character was null data (ordinal 0). To solve it, I just did

str_replace(chr(0), "", $string);

which did the trick.

This took forever to figure out so I hope this helps people reading from hex
data!
===============================================================================

Use the previous example if you want to request the server for a special part
of the content, IF and only if the server accepts the method.
If you want a simple example to ask the server for all the content, but only
save a portion of it, do it this way:
<?php
$content=file_get_contents("http://www.google.com",FALSE,NULL,0,20);
echo $content;
?>

This will echo the 20 first bytes of the google.com source code.
===============================================================================

If working file is bigger than 64kb and you getting deadlock. Your buffer is
overflow. Here are two way how to avoid that.
1) use temporary file for descriptor
<?php
  $descriptorspec = array(
   0 => array("file", "/tmp/ens/a.ens","r"),  // stdin is a pipe that the child
will read from
   1 => array("file", "/tmp/ens/a.html","w"),  // stdout is a pipe that the
child will write to
   2 => array("file", "/tmp/ens/error-output.txt", "a") // stderr is a file to
write to
  );
?>

2) inline read using stream_set_blocking. PHP doesn't proper handle last part
of file.
<?php
  $READ_LEN = 64*1024;
  $MAX_BUF_LEN = 2*$READ_LEN;

  $url = "http://some.domain.com:5984/".$db."/".$member."/contents";
  $src = fopen($url,"r");

  $cwd = '/tmp';
  $cmd['enscript'] = "/usr/bin/enscript";
  $cmd['enscript-options'] = " -q --language=html --color -Ejcl -o -";
  $descriptorspec = array(
    0 => array("pipe", "r"),  // stdin is a pipe that the child will read from
    1 => array("pipe", "w")   // stdout is a pipe that the child will write to
  );

  $ph=proc_open($cmd['enscript']." ".$cmd['enscript-options'],$descriptorspec,
$pipes,$cwd);

  stream_set_blocking($src,0);
  stream_set_blocking($pipes[0],0);
  stream_set_blocking($pipes[1],0);

  $CMD_OUT_OPEN = TRUE; $k = 0;
  while (!feof($pipes[1]) || !feof($src) || $k > 0) {
    if (!feof($src) && $k+$READ_LEN <= $MAX_BUF_LEN) {
      $input .= fread($src,$READ_LEN);
      $k = strlen($input);
    }
    if ($k > 0) {
      $l = fwrite($pipes[0],$input);
      $k -= $l;
      $input = substr($input,$l);
    }
    if ($CMD_OUT_OPEN && $k == 0 && feof($src)) {
      fclose($pipes[0]);
      $CMD_OUT_OPEN = FALSE;
    }
    $output = fread($pipes[1],$READ_LEN);
    $outputn = str_replace("<H1>(stdin)</H1>","",$output);
        echo $outputn;
  }

  fclose($pipes[1]);

  $return_value = proc_close($ph);
?>
===============================================================================

This is an easy way to trigger scripts by listening for POSTs. I simply point a
service's webhook url to the script, which file_get_contents("php://input"),
cast to an array, and then simplexml_load_string() to parse it and use one of
the keys' data as the parameter for my script.
===============================================================================

read text per line and convert to array

for example, the input file is input.txt
the input file containt text below

one
two
three
four
five

++++++++++++++++++++++++++

read value per line

<?php
$data = file_get_contents("input.txt"); //read the file
$convert = explode("\n", $data); //create array separate by new line

for ($i=0;$i<count($convert);$i++) 
{
    echo $convert[$i].', '; //write value by index
}
?>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Output :

one, two, three, four, five,
===============================================================================

Negative offsets don't work as you might expect (like in http://php.net/substr
for example)

So
<?php echo file_get_contents(__FILE__, false, null, -10) ?>
does the same as
<?php echo file_get_contents(__FILE__, false, null, 0) ?>

To get the last 10 characters of a file, you need to use
<?php echo file_get_contents (__FILE__, false, null, (filesize (__FILE__) - 10
)) ?>
===============================================================================

[Editors note: As of PHP 5.2.1 you can specify `timeout` context option and
pass the context to file_get_contents()]

The only way I could get get_file_contents() to wait for a very slow http
request was to set the socket timeout as follows.

ini_set('default_socket_timeout',    120);   
$a = file_get_contents("http://abcxyz.com");

Other times like execution time and input time had no effect.
===============================================================================

I experienced a problem in using hostnames instead straight IP with some server
destinations.

If i use file_get_contents("www.jbossServer.example/app1",...)
i will get an 'Invalid hostname' from the server i'm calling.

This is because file_get_contents probably will rewrite your request after
getting the IP, obtaining the same thing as :
file_get_contents("xxx.yyy.www.zzz/app1",...)

And you know that many servers will deny you access if you go through IP
addressing in the request.

With cURL this problem doesn't exists. It resolves the hostname leaving the
request as you set it, so the server is not rude in response.
===============================================================================

It is important to write the method in capital letters like "GET" or "POST" and
not "get" or "post". Some servers can respond a 400 error if you do not use
caps in the method.
===============================================================================

I decided to make a similar function to this, called file_post_contents, it
uses POST instead of GET to call, kinda handy...

<?php
function file_post_contents($url,$headers=false) {
    $url = parse_url($url);

    if (!isset($url['port'])) {
      if ($url['scheme'] == 'http') { $url['port']=80; }
      elseif ($url['scheme'] == 'https') { $url['port']=443; }
    }
    $url['query']=isset($url['query'])?$url['query']:'';

    $url['protocol']=$url['scheme'].'://';
    $eol="\r\n";

    $headers =  "POST ".$url['protocol'].$url['host'].$url['path']." HTTP/1.0".
$eol.
                "Host: ".$url['host'].$eol.
                "Referer: ".$url['protocol'].$url['host'].$url['path'].$eol.
                "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded".$eol.
                "Content-Length: ".strlen($url['query']).$eol.
                $eol.$url['query'];
    $fp = fsockopen($url['host'], $url['port'], $errno, $errstr, 30);
    if($fp) {
      fputs($fp, $headers);
      $result = '';
      while(!feof($fp)) { $result .= fgets($fp, 128); }
      fclose($fp);
      if (!$headers) {
        //removes headers
        $pattern="/^.*\r\n\r\n/s";
        $result=preg_replace($pattern,'',$result);
      }
      return $result;
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

The offset is 0 based.  Setting it to 1 will skip the first character of the
stream.
===============================================================================

If, like me, you are on a Microsoft network with ISA server and require NTLM
authentication, certain applications will not get out of the network. SETI@Home
Classic and PHP are just 2 of them.

The workaround is fairly simple.

First you need to use an NTLM Authentication Proxy Server. There is one written
in Python and is available from http://apserver.sourceforge.net/. You will need
Python from http://www.python.org/.

Both sites include excellent documentation.

Python works a bit like PHP. Human readable code is handled without having to
produce a compiled version. You DO have the opportunity of compiling the code
(from a .py file to a .pyc file).

Once compiled, I installed this as a service (instsrv and srvany - parts of the
Windows Resource Kit), so when the server is turned on (not logged in), the
Python based NTLM Authentication Proxy Server is running.

Then, and here is the bit I'm really interested in, you need to tell PHP you
intend to route http/ftp requests through the NTLM APS.

To do this, you use contexts.

Here is an example.

<?php

// Define a context for HTTP.
$aContext = array(
    'http' => array(
        'proxy' => 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8080', // This needs to be the server and
the port of the NTLM Authentication Proxy Server.
        'request_fulluri' => True,
        ),
    );
$cxContext = stream_context_create($aContext);

// Now all file stream functions can use this context.

$sFile = file_get_contents("http://www.php.net", False, $cxContext);

echo $sFile;
?>

Hopefully this helps SOMEONE!!!
===============================================================================

This is a nice and simple substitute to get_file_contents() using curl, it
returns FALSE if $contents is empty.

<?php
function curl_get_file_contents($URL)
    {
        $c = curl_init();
        curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
        curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_URL, $URL);
        $contents = curl_exec($c);
        curl_close($c);

        if ($contents) return $contents;
            else return FALSE;
    }
?>

Hope this help, if there is something wrong or something you don't understand
let me know :)
===============================================================================

This functionality is now implemented in the PEAR package PHP_Compat.

More information about using this function without upgrading your version of
PHP can be found on the below link:

http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Compat
===============================================================================

On Centos 5, and maybe other Red Hat based systems, any attempt to use
file_get_contents to access a URL on an http  port other than 80 (e.g. "http://
www.example.com:8040/page") may fail with a permissions violation (error 13)
unless the box you are running php on has its seLinux set to 'permissive' not
'enforcing' . Otherwise the request doesn't even get out of the box, i.e. the
permissions violation is generated locally by seLinux.
===============================================================================

For those having this problem when trying to get_file_contents(url):

Warning: file_get_contents(url): failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! 
in xx on line yy

If you are behind a SonicWall firewall, read this:
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40197
(this little line: uncheck a box in the internal settings of the firewall
labled "Enforce Host Tag Search with for CFS")

Apparently by default SonicWall blocks any HTTP request without a "Host:"
header, which is the case in the PHP get_file_contents(url) implementation.

This is why, if you try to get the same URL from the same machine with cURL our
wget, it works.

I hope this will be useful to someone, it took me hours to find out :)
===============================================================================

If you want to check if the function returned error, in case of a HTTP request
an, it's not sufficient to test it against false. It may happen the return for
that HTTP request was empty. In this case it's better to check if the return
value is a bool.

<?php
$result=file_get_contents("http://www.example.com");
if ($result === false)
{
    // treat error
} else {
    // handle good case
}
?>

[EDIT BY thiago: Has enhacements from an anonymous user]
===============================================================================

Sometimes you might get an error opening an http URL.
even though you have set "allow_url_fopen = On" in php.ini

For me the the solution was to also set "user_agent" to something.
===============================================================================

For those who use file_get_contents for JSON or other RESTful services - like
my architecture did for a big site - this will probably help a lot.

We struggled with having the site using get urls that would go through our load
balancer instead of hitting the local server.

What we did was load this function through a local url and set the Host: header
for our virtualhost entries on the site we wanted to laod.

This code solved our issue:
<?php

//set the header context stream for virtualhost lookup
$context = stream_context_create(array('http' => array('header' => 'Host:
www.VIRTUALHOSTDOMAIN.com')));

//use a localhost url or alternatively 127.0.0.1 ip
$url = 'http://localhost/rest-service/?get-user&id=######';

//fetch the data through webserver using the Host http header we set
$data = json_decode(file_get_contents($url, 0, $context));

//verify you have your data
var_dump($data);

?>
===============================================================================

the bug #36857 was fixed.
http://bugs.php.net/36857

Now you may use this code,to fetch the partial content like this:
<?php
$context=array('http' => array ('header'=> 'Range: bytes=1024-', ),);
$xcontext = stream_context_create($context);
$str=file_get_contents("http://www.fcicq.net/wp/",FALSE,$xcontext);
?>
that's all.
===============================================================================

When using a URI with a login / password (HTTP or FTP, for an example), you may
need to urlencode the password if it contains special characters.
Do not urlencode the whole URI, just the password.

Don't do :
urlencode('ftp://login:mdp%?special@host/dir/file')

Do :
'ftp://login:' . urlencode('mdp%?special') . '@host/dir/file';

Might seem obvious, but is worth noting.
===============================================================================

The funniest thing there is that seeking on non local files may, or may not
work. This is unpredictable, and thus should throw rather than doing some
magical stuff.
Also trying to read non local file which doesn't exists results in FALSE
returned and no single warning emitted.
===============================================================================

if $filename has a relative path file_get_contents returns the uninterpreted
sourcecode of the php-file with all comments etc.

I don't know whether this is a bug or intented or caused by
server-configuration.

I think this behaviour should be included in the description of the function.

file_get_contents is slowest in both of the above examples. If you need the
best performance out of your production box, you might want to throw together a

particular machine, then optimize your code to check the file size and use the
appropriate function for it.

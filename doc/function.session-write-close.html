session_write_close — Write session data and end session

说明

void session_write_close ( void )

End the current session and store session data.

Session data is usually stored after your script terminated without the need to
call session_write_close(), but as session data is locked to prevent concurrent
writes only one script may operate on a session at any time. When using
framesets together with sessions you will experience the frames loading one by
one due to this locking. You can reduce the time needed to load all the frames
by ending the session as soon as all changes to session variables are done.

You can have interesting fun debugging anything with sleep() in it if you have
a session still active.  For example, a page that makes an ajax request, where
the ajax request polls a server-side event (and may not return immediately).

If the ajax function doesn't do session_write_close(), then your outer page
will appear to hang, and opening other pages in new tabs will also stall.
===============================================================================

Make sure that you call session_start() again after session_write_close() if
you rely on the SID rewriting.  Otherwise it will not be rewritten.
===============================================================================

An easy gotcha here - the $_SESSIONS superglobal does not vanish because you
call session_write_close.  If subsequent to the write_close call if you
manipulate the superglobal the changes will not be saved when the script
exists.  Likewise a call to session_regenrate_id will fail.

Closing the session and then manipulating session variables is not something
many would do by intent.  However, if your sessions suddenly start misbehaving,
failing to record changes etc it is well worth checking that the cause is not
this one!
===============================================================================

If you're saving data to a session but finding it's not actually being saved,
check and ensure that you're not assigning any arrays with a key containing the
pipe character (|). This will prevent the session data from being serialized
and saved.
===============================================================================

Beware, if you overwrite the default PHP Session handling and use debugging
code inside the write() function, the debugging code is not executed until you
run session_write_close().

I tried everything, file logging directly from the write() function, global
debugging variable increments, static class properties. The only things written
were the session open() and read() calls. My debugging code looks like this:
<?php
$Session = new Session();
...
class Session() {
    public function write($id)
        $sql = "UPDATE ... WHERE id=". mysql_real_escape_string($id);
        self::$debug_Info .= "session_write sql=$sql";
    ...
}

# then at the very end of the script:
# session debugging
session_write_close();
error_log($Session->getDebugInfo(), 3, 'logs/sessions.log');
?>

where getDebugInfo simply returns self::$debug_Info. Without
session_write_close() the sessions.log would only contain the open() and read()
calls.

Maybe intuitive to many, it took days to realize. hope it helps!
===============================================================================

It is a good idea to call session_write_close() before proceeding to a
redirection using

header("Location: URL");
exit();

because it ensures the session is updated (in a file or into a database,
depending on the handler you're using) BEFORE you redirect the visitor
somewhere else.

Workaround if session_write_close() still doesn't write sessions fast enough:

I found with one PHP login system that even session_write_close() was not
setting the session variables before I transferred pages with a Location:
header.  So the user would log in, I would create the $_SESSION variables, call
session_write_close() and then transfer to the secure page using header
(Location:...).  The secure page would check for the session vars, not find
them, and force the user to log in again.  After the second login the session
would be found and they could continue.

My workaround was to create the $_SESSION variables with 0 values before
writing the initial login page.  Then I updated the session vars with the login
results and used the header() function to switch to the secure location.  Once
the session vars have already been created, updated values are assigned
quickly.  Problem solved.  Just be sure the secure page checks both that the
$_SESSION var exists AND that it's not 0.
===============================================================================

i have been using a mysql database custom session handler (not using cookies)
and was having problems getting the session data to be saved consistantly on my
database driven website

clients also have to navigate across domains for website management at times so
i have some special code to make all this happen relatively seamlessly and to
ensure that each person's data is secure.

i added session_write_close() at the very end of the last script that set
session data and solved the problem.

i am not sure why, but it seems the calls to write and close were not always
being made (i was not smart enough to figure it out)

now that the session_write_close() call is being made, my problems seemed to
have disappeared - hopefully for good.

hope this helps someone.

Beware of session_write_close when calling PHP scripts from an Ajax page: this
does not "finalize" the session data writing, but in fact it resets it!
===============================================================================

Along the same lines as what cenaculo at netcabo dot pt, bkatz at
usefulengineering dot com, and editorial at literati dot ca said about making
sure you session_write_close(), don't forget to ob_end_flush() if you're using
output buffering.

I've been having some weird hanging issues when I tried to navigate away from a
page with content streaming in an Iframe or a separate window.

Instead of:

<?
ob_start();
session_start();
/* Do session stuff here; security; logging; etc. */
session_write_close();
/* NOW write out the requested file. */
header("Content-type: audio/x-mpeg"); /* or whatever type */
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=" . $filename);
header("Content-Length: " . $filesize);
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n\n");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");
$file_contents = file_get_contents($filepath);  
print($file_contents);
?>

Do:

<?
ob_start();
session_start();
/* Do session stuff here; security; logging; etc. */
session_write_close();
/* Make sure data is actually flushed out to the browser */
ob_end_flush();
/* NOW write out the requested file. */
header("Content-type: audio/x-mpeg"); /* or whatever type */
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=" . $filename);
header("Content-Length: " . $filesize);
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n\n");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");
$file_contents = file_get_contents($filepath);  
print($file_contents);
?>
===============================================================================

For the session problem when using header("Location:..."), I found
session_write_close() not to help me on the my IIS server using PHP in CGI
mode. The problem was the PHPSESSID cookie was never being set, so I did it the
manual way:

header("Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=" . session_id() . "; path=/");

Worked for me this way!
===============================================================================

My sessions were screwing up because I had 2 different session IDs going at
once:

- 1 PHPSESSID cookie for domain.com
- 1 PHPSESSID cookie for www.domain.com

This fixed it:

//At the beginning of each page...
session_set_cookie_params  (1800,"/","domain.com");
session_start();
===============================================================================

Remember: objects with private and/or protected data members cannot be
serialized properly by PHP. If you ever find that you are missing some objects
from your $_SESSION, make sure you are accounting for this shortcoming in your
application.
===============================================================================

if you are trying to work with a larger code base meant for a specific
application... and it implements some custom session save handlers, it appears
there is no way to reset those save handlers back to the default php state if
they are getting in your way.  my workaround:

session_write_close(); // close the session at the top of the page :)
===============================================================================

I had a problem with realizing the restore password form. First a user entered
his login or e-mail in the system.

Then the script searched the database, got the session data, and sended link
with SID to registered e-mail. The link was configured so, that it restored
session data and logged user in the secure interface to the change password
form.

Then was displayed a page with the message about sended message.

The problem was that ID was not unique in three pages, the SID sended to e-mail
anyone could see in cookie.

I tryed to start new session before generating and after sending link with the
code:

<?php ....
session_start();
/*Getting user login and e-mail from database*/
$user_login = "....";
$user_id = "....."

/*CLOSE PREVIOUS SESSION*/
session_unlink();
session_destroy();

/*NOW GENERATING LINK FOR SESSION DATA */
session_start();
$_SESSION = $user_login;
$_SESSION = $user_id;
/*here generating link:*/
$link = "http://host.com/restore=" . SID . "";
mail (....);

/*CLOSE THE SESSION WITH USER DATA*/
session_write_close();

/*AND STARTING A NEW SESSION*/
session_start();
/*THEN LOAD THE 'MESSAGE SENDED' PAGE*/
header("Location: /restore/message_sended/");

?>

The trouble was that SID was the same even after session_unlink() and
session_write_close(). The session_start() function just restored the previous
session data!!! So the script was not safe.
Then I added session_regenerate_id() call after each session_start().

<?php ....
session_start();
/*Getting user login and e-mail from database*/
$user_login = "....";
$user_id = "....."

/*CLOSE PREVIOUS SESSION*/
session_unlink();
session_destroy();

/*NOW GENERATING LINK FOR SESSION DATA */
session_start();
session_regenerate_id();//Regenerating SID for sending

$_SESSION = $user_login;
$_SESSION = $user_id;

/*here generating link:*/
$link = "http://host.com/restore=" . SID . "";
mail (....);

/*CLOSE THE SESSION WITH USER DATA*/
session_write_close();

/*AND STARTING ANOTHER NEW SESSION*/
session_start();
session_regenerate_id(); //Regenerating SID
/*THEN LOAD THE 'MESSAGE SENDED' PAGE*/
header("Location: /restore/message_sended/");

?>

And now it works as needed! The SID sending to user we cannot see in cookies
nor before neither after generated link, but the data is saved in session with
this id. So only the owner of account can get it!
===============================================================================

This function is useful for forcing serialization of session data but it can
introduce difficult-to-track bugs if it's called more than once per
session_start() call.  Since it doesn't have a return value or raise an
exception there won't be any indication that the serialization failed and the
code will continue normally.  Only when a user visits a page that depends on
unsaved session data will there be any indication of the failure.
As far as I can tell this affects both the default and custom session handling
functions.

<?
session_start();
$_SESSION['foo'] = 'box';
session_write_close();

if (array_key_exists('visited',$_SESSION) {
    echo "welcome back!\n"; # will never happen
} else {
    echo "I don't know you.\n";
    $_SESSION['visited'] = true;
    session_write_close();
}
?>
===============================================================================

As we all know, if an object is serialised, then the class definition must be
included _before_ it is unserialised.

My framework has an enormous number of class files, and including them all at
the beginning of the script was really taking it's toll on my system (memory
and execution time) so I switched to including required classes at the top of
each class file that used them using require_once.

This caused problems because I start my session at the very beginning of my
script's execution, but all my class files aren't there at the beginning!!

So no in my special 'require' function, I do the following:

if(!class_exists($to_require))
{
    session_write_close();
    require_once('path/to/classes/'.$to_require.'.php');
    session_start();
}

This is a considerably smaller performance hit that including every class that
the application uses at the very beginning of the application.
===============================================================================

Further to the comment by nakanishi at mailstyle dot com, it appears that
calling session_write_close() followed by session_start() causes issues if you
have more than one browser window/tab open in the session, and have a large
session data array.  I have an intermitent (and hard to replicate reliably)
issue with session_start() never being called or not returning - the script
hangs before the session headers are written.  I'm puting this down to trying
to be too clever rather than to a bug per se.
===============================================================================

When trying to use exec on Windows 2003 Server together with WAMP you probably
will experience that the server stops to answer your requests.

Through calling session_write_close before -every- exec this will solve your
problem.

Hope this will help someone!
===============================================================================

session_write_close() worked as a lifesaver for me when automatically uploading
files to a user (forcing a download instead of a link). If files are large, and
since session_start() does not allow another page using session_start() to
proceed until it's done, i was not able to upload more than one file at a time.
By using session_write_close() before beginning the file upload, my users can
now download as many big files as they like, at the same time. Example:

<?
session_start();
/* Do session stuff here; security; logging; etc. */
session_write_close();
/* NOW write out the requested file. */
header("Content-type: audio/x-mpeg"); /* or whatever type */
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=" . $filename);
header("Content-Length: " . $filesize);
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n\n");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");
$file_contents = file_get_contents($filepath);   
print($file_contents);
?>
===============================================================================

Using a SQL Server database and Windows Server 2003, if you use
session_write_close() prior to a header() call, and it still appears to freeze
up your session, check to make sure that you are not in the middle of a
transaction.

I noticed that by starting a transaction, executing some queries, attempting to
write close the session and then redirecting without rolling back or committing
that transaction, your session may freeze up. Just like what you may experience
if you attempt to redirect with header() without first calling
session_write_close().
===============================================================================

I had a similar problem with session data.
I lost the session data randomly, without any pattern. I didn't even use the
header(location:... ) function.

Tried:
set "session.use_cookies" to 1 in php.ini
session-write-close()
ob_start() / ob_end_flush()

No matter what I did, it didn't worked.

Finally, when I set the "session.use_only_cookies" to 1, problem is solved. I
am no longer losing any sessions.
===============================================================================

I was having the same problem as many here regarding setting session data just
before a header location redirect and having the session data just not be
there.  I tried everything people here said, and none of their combinations
worked.  What did finally work for me was to fire off a session_regenerate_id
(true) call just prior to the header() and die() calls.

session_regenerate_id(true);
header('location: blah blah');
die();

Without the regenerate id call, the write close did not seem to do anything. 
session_write_close() doesn't seem to matter at all.  It certainly didn't fix
anything on its own for me.

This is a rather annoying issue with php sessions that I've never run into
before.  I store my sessions to /dev/shm (which is RAM) so file IO blocking
can't be the problem.  Now I'm nervous that some other session data might not
be getting updated prior to a header() location change, which is extremely
important and common in any web app.

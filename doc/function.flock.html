(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

flock — 轻便的咨询文件锁定

说明

bool flock ( resource $handle , int $operation [, int &$wouldblock ] )

flock() 允许执行一个简单的可以在任何平台中使用的读取/写入模型（包括大部分的
Unix 派生版和甚至是 Windows）。

在 PHP 5.3.2版本之前，锁也会被 fclose() 释放（在脚本结束后会自动调用）。

PHP 支持以咨询方式（也就是说所有访问程序必须使用同一方式锁定, 否则它不会工作）
锁定全部文件的一种轻便方法。默认情况下，这个函数会阻塞到获取锁；这可以通过下面
文档中 LOCK_NB 选项来控制（在非 Windows 平台上）。

参数

handle

    文件系统指针，是典型地由 fopen() 创建的 resource(资源)。

operation

    operation 可以是以下值之一：
      □ LOCK_SH取得共享锁定（读取的程序）。
      □ LOCK_EX 取得独占锁定（写入的程序。
      □ LOCK_UN 释放锁定（无论共享或独占）。

    如果不希望 flock() 在锁定时堵塞，则是 LOCK_NB（Windows 上还不支持）。

wouldblock

    如果锁定会堵塞的话（EWOULDBLOCK 错误码情况下），可选的第三个参数会被设置为
    TRUE。（Windows 上不支持）

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.3.2 在文件资源句柄关闭时不再自动解锁。现在要解锁必须手动进行。
4.0.1 增加了常量 LOCK_XXX。之前你必须使用 1 代表 LOCK_SH，2 代表 LOCK_EX，3 代
      表LOCK_UN，4 代表 LOCK_NB。

范例

Example #1 flock() 例子

<?php

$fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");

if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {  // 进行排它型锁定
    ftruncate($fp, 0);      // truncate file
    fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
    fflush($fp);            // flush output before releasing the lock
    flock($fp, LOCK_UN);    // 释放锁定
} else {
    echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
}

fclose($fp);

?>

Example #2 flock() 使用 LOCK_NB 选项

<?php
$fp = fopen('/tmp/lock.txt', 'r+');

/* Activate the LOCK_NB option on an LOCK_EX operation */
if(!flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
    echo 'Unable to obtain lock';
    exit(-1);
}

/* ... */

fclose($fp);
?>

注释

    Note:

    flock() uses mandatory locking instead of advisory locking on Windows.
    Mandatory locking is also supported on Linux and System V based operating
    systems via the usual mechanism supported by the fcntl() system call: that
    is, if the file in question has the setgid permission bit set and the group
    execution bit cleared. On Linux, the file system will also need to be
    mounted with the mand option for this to work.

    Note:

    由于 flock() 需要一个文件指针，因此可能不得不用一个特殊的锁定文件来保护打算
    通过写模式打开的文件的访问（在 fopen() 函数中加入 "w" 或 "w+"）。

    Note:

    May only be used on file pointers returned by fopen() for local files, or
    file pointers pointing to userspace streams that implement the 
    streamWrapper::stream_lock() method.

Warning

Assigning another value to handle argument in subsequent code will release the
lock.

Warning

在部分操作系统中 flock() 以进程级实现。当用一个多线程服务器 API（比如 ISAPI）时
，可能不可以依靠 flock() 来保护文件，因为运行于同一服务器实例中其它并行线程的
PHP 脚本可以对该文件进行处理。

flock() 不支持旧的文件系统，如 FAT 以及它的派生系统。因此，此环境下总是返回
FALSE（尤其是对 Windows 98 用户来说）。


User Contributed Notes 35 notes

===============================================================================

The supplied documentation is vague, ambiguous and lacking, and the user
comments contain erroneous information! The flock function follows the
semantics of the Unix system call bearing the same name. Flock utilizes
ADVISORY locking only; that is, other processes may ignore the lock completely;
it only affects those that call the flock call.

LOCK_SH means SHARED LOCK. Any number of processes MAY HAVE A SHARED LOCK
simultaneously. It is commonly called a reader lock.

LOCK_EX means EXCLUSIVE LOCK. Only a single process may possess an exclusive
lock to a given file at a time.

If the file has been LOCKED with LOCK_SH in another process, flock with LOCK_SH
will SUCCEED. flock with LOCK_EX will BLOCK UNTIL ALL READER LOCKS HAVE BEEN
RELEASED.

If the file has been locked with LOCK_EX in another process, the CALL WILL
BLOCK UNTIL ALL OTHER LOCKS have been released.

If however, you call flock on a file on which you possess the lock, it will try
to change it. So: flock(LOCK_EX) followed by flock(LOCK_SH) will get you a
SHARED lock, not "read-write" lock.
===============================================================================

LOCK_NB seems to be checked and works fine in Windows, too, in PHP 5.3.3.

For instance, try concurrently running two instances of the following script
(via the CLI). The second prints "Didn't quite get the lock..." as expected,
whereas w/o the LOCK_NB flag, it just hangs.

<?php
$x = fopen("flocktest.txt", "w");
if (flock($x, LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) {
    print "No problems, I got the lock, now I'm going to sit on it.";
    while (true)
        sleep(5);
} else {
    print "Didn't quite get the lock. Quitting now. Good night.";
}
fclose($x);
?>
===============================================================================

I just spent some time (again) to understand why a reading with
file_get_contents() and file was returning me an empty string "" or array()
whereas the file was existing and the contents not empty.

In fact, i was locking file when writing it (file_put_contents third arg) but
not testing if file was locked when reading it (and the file was accessed a
lot).

So, please pay attention that file_get_contents(), file() and maybe others php
files functions are going to return empty data like if the contents of the file
was an empty string.

To avoid this problem, you have to set a LOCK_SH on your file before reading it
(and then waiting if locked).

Something like this :

<?php
public static function getContents($path, $waitIfLocked = true) {
    if(!file_exists($path)) {
        throw new Exception('File "'.$path.'" does not exists');
    }
    else {
        $fo = fopen($path, 'r');
        $locked = flock($fo, LOCK_SH, $waitIfLocked);
       
        if(!$locked) {
            return false;
        }
        else {
            $cts = file_get_contents($path);
           
            flock($fo, LOCK_UN);
            fclose($fo);
           
            return $cts;
        }
    }
}
?>

Code to test by yourself :

abc.txt :
someText

file.php :
<?php
$fo = fopen('abc.txt', 'r+');

flock($fo, LOCK_EX);
sleep(10);
flock($fo, LOCK_UN);
?>

file2.php :
<?php
var_dump(file_get_contents('abc.txt'));
var_dump(file('abc.txt'));
?>

Then launch file.php and switch to file2.php during the 10 seconds and see the
difference before/after
===============================================================================

Regarding the change in PHP 5.3.2 with locked files:

Without having studied the PHP source code in detail, the situation appears to
be as follows when the PHP function fclose() is called:

Before 5.3.2 PHP would check if the file was locked, then release the lock, and
then close the file.

From 5.3.2 PHP just closes the file.

But note, that the operating system releases the lock automatically when the
file is closed. Therefore a call to fclose() STILL releases the lock (this is
tested with PHP 5.3.2, Linux, x64).
===============================================================================

Here's a handy class to allow retrying a write with flock a set number of
times. If it can't flock, it will sleep for a brief random interval and try
again. If you have a lot of concurrent writes going on, you can use it to avoid
data corruption.

<?php
class SafeWriter
{
    // suggested mode 'a' for writing to the end of the file
    public static function writeData($path, $mode, $data)
    {
        $fp = fopen($path, $mode);
        $retries = 0;
        $max_retries = 100;

        if (!$fp) {
            // failure
            return false;
        }

        // keep trying to get a lock as long as possible
        do {
            if ($retries > 0) {
                usleep(rand(1, 10000));
            }
            $retries += 1;
        } while (!flock($fp, LOCK_EX) and $retries <= $max_retries);

        // couldn't get the lock, give up
        if ($retries == $max_retries) {
            // failure
            return false;
        }

        // got the lock, write the data
        fwrite($fp, "$data\n");
        // release the lock
        flock($fp, LOCK_UN);
        fclose($fp);
        // success
        return true;
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

When writing to a file, you should avoid using w+ because it would erase the
contents of the file before locking

If you need to write the complete file again you could use the following
instead:

<?php
$fp = fopen('yourfile.txt', 'a') ;

if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {
    ftruncate($fp, 0) ; // <-- this will erase the contents such as 'w+'
   
    fputs($fp, 'test string') ;
   
    flock($fp, LOCK_UN) ;
}

fclose($fp) ;
?>

===============================================================================

you can wrap a lock as an object to make it a scope-based lock. when the lock
object is no longer referenced, like when it's unset or the owner returns, the
destructor will call unlock.

this way you can just create a lock object and forget about it.

<?php
class lock {

    private $handle;

    public static function read ( $handle ) {
        $lock = new static();
        $lock->handle = $handle;
        return flock($handle,LOCK_SH) ? $lock : false;
    }

    public static function write ( $handle ) {
        $lock = new static();
        $lock->handle = $handle;
        return flock($handle,LOCK_EX) ? $lock : false;
    }

    public function __destruct ( ) {
        flock($this->handle,LOCK_UN);
    }

}
?>
===============================================================================

Actually, there is no use of the while loop with the usleep. My testing has
revealed the following:

<?php
//some code here
flock($file_handle, LOCK_EX) // <- Your code will pause here untill you get the
lock for indefinite amount of time or till your script times out
//some code here
?>

This will actually check for the lock without pausing and then it will sleep:

<?php
//code here
while (!flock($file_handle, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
//Lock not acquired, try again in:
usleep(round(rand(0, 100)*1000)) //0-100 miliseconds
}
//lock acquired
//rest of the code
?>

The problem is, if you have a busy site and a lots of locking, the while loop
may not acquire the lock for some time. Locking without LOCK_NB is much more
persistent and it will wait for the lock for as long as it takes. It is almose
guaranteed that the file will be locked, unless the script times out or
something.

Consider these two scripts: 1st one is ran, and the second one is ran 5 seconds
after the first.

<?php
//1st script
$file_handle = fopen('file.test', 'r+');
flock($file_handle, LOCK_EX); //lock the file
sleep(10); //sleep 10 seconds
fclose($file_handle); //close and unlock the file
?>

<?php
//2nd script
$file_handle = fopen('file.test', 'r+');
flock($file_handle, LOCK_EX); //lock the file
fclose($file_handle); //close and unlock the file
?>

If you run 1st and then the 2nd script,the 2nd script will wait untill the 1st
has finished. As soon as the first script finishes, the second one will acquire
the lock and finish the execution. If you use flock($file_handle, LOCK_EX |
LOCK_NB) in the 2nd script while the 1st script is running, it would finish
execution immediately and you would not get the lock.
===============================================================================

I just want to add a note about making atomic lock on NFS, there is only two
ways:

- 1 (the most robust but the most complicate) - It's to use link() to create a
  hard link to a file you want to lock (on the same FS of course).
  (On most NFS implementations, Link() is atomic)

Once you created a hard link (not a symbolic link), with a unique randomly
generated name, call stat() on it and count the number of link (nlink), if
there
is only 2 then the file is locked.

If there is more than two you have to unlink() the link you just created and
create a new one with a new unique name (else NFS will use its cache and stat
will return wrong data) then call stat() on the new link and test the number of
links again, repeat this operation until you get the lock.

You have to use usleep() between the link() attempts with a fixed + random
sleep value to avoid dead lock situations (link() and unlink() may be atomic
but not instantaneous)

Also note than when you unlink a file through NFS, if NFS think that the file
is still in use, it will create a .nfs link to this file until it realizes the
file is no longer in use... A wrong timing could generate thousands of those
files and a deadlock situation.  Because of this when a deadlock situation
occurs or if your stat() command returns a very high number of links, you have
to look for .nfs file in the same directory you created your links and unlink
all the .nfs file you find (sometimes NFS take its time to remove them)

- 2 (the simplest) - the second method is to use a lock server and lock daemons
  on each client that will forward lock request to the server... (this is more
dangerous than the first method because the daemons may be killed...)

Here is for reference the function I created to make atomic locks through NFS
(this function is in production since at least 4 years now), it's just for
reference because it uses many external functions to do its job but you can see
the principle:

http://pastey.net/85793
===============================================================================

I have found that if you open a currently locked file with 'w' or 'w+' ("file
pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length") 
then it will not truncate the file when the lock is released and the file
available.

Example I used to test it:
<?php
// a.php
$fp = fopen( "/tmp/lock.txt", "w+" );
flock( $fp, LOCK_EX ); // exclusive lock

$steps = 10;
// write to the file
for ($i=0; $i< $steps; $i++) {
    fwrite($fp, 'a '.time().' test '. $i."\n");
    sleep(1);
}
flock( $fp, LOCK_UN ); // release the lock
fclose( $fp );
?>

----------
<?php
// b.php

$fp = fopen( "/tmp/lock.txt", "w+" );
flock( $fp, LOCK_EX ); // exclusive lock

// ftruncate($fp, 0) is needed here! <----

$steps = 5;
// write to the file
for ($i=0; $i< $steps; $i++) {
    fwrite($fp, 'b '.time().' test '. $i."\n");
    sleep(1);
}
flock( $fp, LOCK_UN ); // release the lock
fclose( $fp );
?>

Loading a.php then loading b.php right after will result in:
b 1054075769 test 0
b 1054075770 test 1
b 1054075771 test 2
b 1054075772 test 3
b 1054075773 test 4
a 1054075764 test 5
a 1054075765 test 6
a 1054075766 test 7
a 1054075767 test 8
a 1054075768 test 9

As you can see, b.php does not truncate the file as the w+ would suggest if the
file were instantly available. But only moves the pointer to the begining of
the file. If b.php was loaded after a.php finished then there would be no "a
..." lines in the file, since it would be truncated.

To fix this you have to add ftruncate($fp, 0) right after the flock.

'r+' and 'a' seem to work fine, though.
===============================================================================

If you are interested in using file locking as indicator that your console app
is running and you don't want to start it again:

if (!flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB, $wouldblock)) {
                if ($wouldblock) {
                    //Another process holds the lock!
              
                } else {
                    //Couldn't lock for another reason, e.g. no such file
            
                }
            } else {
                //Lock obtained

                startJob();
            }
Please note that this is platform independent solution, but you have
restrictions in PHP version (5.5.22 on Windows).
Also, some old file systems are not supported.

Simple Helper for lock files creation

<?php

class FileLocker {
    protected static $loc_files = array();

    public static function lockFile($file_name, $wait = false) {
        $loc_file = fopen($file_name, 'c');
        if ( !$loc_file ) {
            throw new \Exception('Can\'t create lock file!');
        }
        if ( $wait ) {
            $lock = flock($loc_file, LOCK_EX);
        } else {
            $lock = flock($loc_file, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB);
        }
        if ( $lock ) {
            self::$loc_files[$file_name] = $loc_file;
            fprintf($loc_file, "%s\n", getmypid());
            return $loc_file;
        } else if ( $wait ) {
            throw new \Exception('Can\'t lock file!');
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public static function unlockFile($file_name) {
        fclose(self::$loc_files[$file_name]);
        @unlink($file_name);
        unset(self::$loc_files[$file_name]);
    }

}

if ( !FileLocker::lockFile('/tmp/1.lock') ) {
    echo "Can't lock file\n";
    die();
}
sleep(10);
FileLocker::unlockFile('/tmp/1.lock');
echo "All Ok\n";
===============================================================================

Note that Example #1 contains a bug: ftruncate() does *not* re-set the file
pointer to the beginning of the file. You need to execute a call to rewind()
afterward. I realize that the ftruncate page does mention this, but if anybody
copies the example above (as I did), their program will not work correctly
unless they fix this.
===============================================================================

if you are used to reply with qualified error messages by using "track_errors =
1" and $php_errormsg,  flock() will nark you, if you use LOCK_NB .

If flock() fails due to LOCK_NB $php_errormsg will not be created and filled
with an error message like 'could not lock file, file already locked'.

You can use some little workaround which does also on WIN:

#---------------------------------
GLOBAL $MYERRORMSG;

function some_file_operations($filename)
{
    GLOBAL $MYERRORMSG;

    # ...
    # ...

    if (! @flock($fh, LOCK_SH | LOCK_NB, $wb))
       {
        if (!isset($php_errormsg)) $php_errormsg = 'could not lock file, file
already locked';
        $MYERRORMSG = $php_errormsg;
        return false;
    }   
}
#--------------------------------

In case of fail $MYERRORMSG now will hold a qualified error message
===============================================================================

I've been having trouble getting Flock to work when I read a file, delete it,
and then output slightly changed information back to the same location.  When
deleting with Unlink, there's a very brief period of time where no file
exists.  But, if you do an fopen using the "w" mode, it keeps the file in
existence, but deletes all of its data when you go to write to it.  That way,
the file never actually disappears, and another script accessing the same file
with flock won't get a "file doesn't exist" error.
===============================================================================

Use rename or unlink on handled file breaked LOCK_EX flock on handle (Linux
only).

Example:

$handle = fopen($lockFile, 'c');
var_dump(flock($handle, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)); // false because flock use other
php process
rename($lockFile, $lockFile.'.old'); // or unlink
var_dump(flock($handle, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)); // always true (!!!)
===============================================================================

You cannot combine gzopen with flock; so:

<?php
$f = gzopen($file,'w');
$o = flock($f, LOCK_EX);
var_dump($o);
flush();
?>

Gives:

boolean false
===============================================================================

I use exclusive writing to replace standard flock():

<?php
// get/set lock file name
function m_lock_file( $format = null ) {
    static $file_format = './%s.lock';
   
    if ($format !== null) {
        $file_format = $format;
    }
   
    return $file_format;
}

// acquire/check/release lock
function m_lock( $lockId, $acquire = null ) {
    static $handlers = array();
   
    if (is_bool($acquire)) {
        $file = sprintf(m_lock_file(), md5($lockId), $lockId);
    }
   
    if ($acquire === false) {
        if (isset($handlers[$lockId])) {
            @fclose($handlers[$lockId]);
            @unlink($file);
            unset($handlers[$lockId]);
        } else {
            trigger_error("Lock '$lockId' is already unlocked", E_USER_WARNING
);
        }
    }
   
    if ($acquire === true) {
        if (!isset($handlers[$lockId])) {
            $handler = false;
            $count = 100;
            do {
                if (!file_exists($file) || @unlink($file)) {
                    $handler = @fopen($file, "x");
                }
                if (false === $handler) {
                    usleep(10000);
                } else {
                    $handlers[$lockId] = $handler;
                }
            } while (false === $handler && $count-- > 0);
        } else {
            trigger_error("Lock '$lockId' is already locked", E_USER_WARNING);
        }
    }
   
    return isset($handlers[$lockId]);
}
?>

Usage sample:

<?php
$lockId = "qq";

m_lock($lockId, true);
if (m_lock($lockId)) {
    echo "locked";

    // here you can perform any thread-safe operations
    usleep(300 * 1000);

    m_lock($lockId, false);
} else {
    echo "not locked";
}

?>
===============================================================================

Notice: On NFS with NFS locking daemon you cannot open file for reading and
than lock exklusively:

$rFopened  = fopen($sFile,'r');
$bResult   = flock($rFopened, LOCK_EX);

var_dump($bResult); // returns FALSE

Mixed fopen modes (a+, w+ ...) works with LOCK_EX fine.
===============================================================================

Like a user already noted, most Linux kernels (at least the Redhat ones) will
return false, even if you locked the file. This is because the lock is only
ADVISORY (you can check that in /proc/locks). What you have to do there is to
evalute the 3rd parameter of flock(), $eWouldBlock. See for an example below.
Note however that if you
lock the file in non blocking mode, flock() will work as expected (and blocks
the script).

<?php
                                                                               
$fp = fopen( "/var/lock/process.pid", "a" );
if ( !$fp || !flock($fp,LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB,$eWouldBlock) || $eWouldBlock ) {
  fputs( STDERR, "Failed to acquire lock!\n" );

fclose( $fp );
unlink( "/var/lock/process.pid" );

besides from what the manual says about locking a file opendend in w or w+ and
using a special lock file for these cases, you should simply truncate the file
yourself with ftruncate() after writing:

<?php

$data='some data';
$handle=fopen('file','r+');
flock($handle,LOCK_EX);
fwrite($handle,$data);
ftruncate($handle,ftell($handle));
flock($handle,LOCK_UN);
fclose($handle);

?>

now the file will have the size of $data without opening the file in w mode but
with a lock on the file.

to the previous writers jpriebe and mallory:
of course the lock is lost in this case, but thats simply because the file is
closed by PHP. and closing the file means unlocking it (same as when you use
fclose() yourself).
===============================================================================

I have noticed that if you change the value of your fopen ressource, the lock
is working no longer..

<?php

$fo = fopen('lockfile.txt','a');

flock($fo,LOCK_EX);

$fo = '';

// Lock is disable

?>
===============================================================================

Just a comment about the last method to lock files using filemtime().
What if   filemtime($fp[1]) == $fp[3]   because somebody modified the file less
than 1s after the value of $fp[3] was picked up?
Then this modification will be lost...?

This system to lock files is made to prevent problems when two modifications
are so close that they can interfere, so the case "less than 1s" will often
happen?

However, lose some modifications is better than spoil all the file...
===============================================================================

Further information on flock: The system is not restarted if a signal is
delivered to the process, so flock will happily return false in case of
SIGALRM, SIGFPE or something else.
===============================================================================

Indeed, flock() will not work reliably when the underlying filesystem is NFS.
The proper way to perform file locking, in this case, would be to use PHP's
link() function. From the Linux man page of open():

       O_EXCL When used with O_CREAT, if the file  already  exists  it  is  an
              error  and  the open will fail. In this context, a symbolic link
              exists, regardless of where its points to.  O_EXCL is broken  on
              NFS file systems, programs which rely on it for performing lock-
              ing tasks will contain a race condition.  The solution for  per-
              forming  atomic  file  locking  using  a lockfile is to create a
              unique file on the same fs  (e.g.,  incorporating  hostname  and
              pid),  use  link(2)  to  make  a link to the lockfile. If link()
              returns 0, the lock is successful.  Otherwise,  use  stat(2)  on
              the  unique  file to check if its link count has increased to 2,
              in which case the lock is also successful.
===============================================================================

flock on Solaris is slightly strange: it will fail if you try to get an
exclusive lock on a file not opened for writing. That is, for reading files,
you MUST use a shared lock. From the Solaris man page for flock:

"Read permission is required on a file to obtain a shared lock, and write 
permission is required to obtain an exclusive lock."

In contrast, this is from the Linux man page for flock:

"The mode used to open the file doesn’t matter to flock."

So, beware...
===============================================================================

I ran into a loop because I just checked for true (= you got the lock) as
return value of flock() and tried again when I got a false.

<?php
    function naive_wait_for_file($fp) {
        while (true) {
            if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {
                return;
            }
            $k = rand(0, 20);
            usleep(round($k * 10000));  # k * 10ms
        }
    }
?>

Unfortunately in one case the $fp I put in was invalid, so I always got false
and got stuck.
Lesson: check if your $fp is valid before entering the loop, or look closer if
you get a false.

<?php
    function wait_for_file($fp) {
        if ($fp === false) {
            return;
        }
        while (true) {
            if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {
                return;
            }
            $k = rand(0, 20);
            usleep(round($k * 10000));  # k * 10ms
        }
    }
?>
===============================================================================

just wanted to say that you will most likely fail if you use a separate lock
file together with register_shutdown_function.

my script did some different actions... resizing pictures, rotating them and
this stuff. it needed a "database" file to get the correct file locations. this
database file also stored some flags. and of course the script had to save that
file when it was done.

because of my script exited on many different points depending on the action i
used register_shutdown_function to save the file. it wanted to use a locking
system to be sure the script doesn't overwrite the data another process had
written into it some microseconds before. i was running on windows 2000 and
apache2 on my developing machine, and flock always returned true for some
reason... so i used a separate lock file. the script looked for it at the
beginning and exited if it was found. otherwise it created it. but this file
had to be deleted at the end. i put the unlink command into the registered
shutdown-function but it never deleted the file. i tried clearstatcache and
some other stuff but it didn't help.

maybe this helps someone.
===============================================================================

I'm thinking that a good way to ensure that no data is lost would be to create
a buffer directory that could store the instructions for what is to be written
to a file, then whenever the file is decidedly unlocked, a single execution
could loop through every file in that directory and apply the indicated changes
to the file.

I'm working on writing this for a flat-file based database.  The way it works
is, whenever a command is issued (addline, removeline, editline), the command
is stored in a flat file stored in a folder named a shortened version of the
filename to be edited and named by the time and a random number.  In that file
is a standardized set of commands that define what is to be done to what file
(the likes of "file: SecuraLog/index_uid" new line "editline: 14").

Each execution will check every folder in that directory for files and a
certain amount of time (I don't know how long, maybe 1-2 seconds) is spent
making pending changes to unlocked files.  This way no changes will be lost
(i.e. person 1 makes a change at the same time as person 2, and person 1 loses
the race by just enough to have their changed version of the file overwritten
by person 2's version) and there will be no problems with opening an empty open
file.
===============================================================================

You should lock the file _before_ opening it, and unlock _after_ closing it.
Othervise an another process might be able to access the file between the lock/
unlock and the open/close operation.
===============================================================================

"Assigning another value to handle argument in subsequent code will release the
lock."
Note: this is also true for losing the handle's context completely (like
returning from a function, in which the handle was a local variable).

<?php
touch("testfile");

function mylock() {
  $F1 = fopen("testfile","r");
  if (flock($F1,LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) echo "First lock OK\n"; else echo "First lock
FAIL\n";
  $F2 = fopen("testfile","r");
  if (flock($F2,LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) echo "Second lock OK\n"; else echo "Second
lock FAIL\n";
}

mylock();
echo "Function returned.\n";
mylock();

unlink("testfile");
?>

Prints out:

First lock OK
Second lock FAIL
Function returned.
First lock OK
Second lock FAIL

This will lock the testfile, then attempt to lock it again with a new file
handle (obviously failing). Trying this again, though, results in proper
locking again (and then failing again), because when exiting the function both
handles are lost and automatically unlocked.
===============================================================================

I've been testing a few custom file access functions but I always liked the
simplicity of file_get_contents(). Of course it doesn't seem to respect any
file locks created with flock(). I created the function below to wrap around
file_get_contents() so it can support locked files. It's an odd way of doing it
but it works for me.

<?php
function flock_get_contents($filename){

    $return = FALSE;

    if(is_string($filename) && !empty($filename)){
        if(is_readable($filename)){
            if($handle = @fopen($filename, 'r')){
                while(!$return){
                    if(flock($handle, LOCK_SH)){
                        if($return = file_get_contents($filename)){
                            flock($handle, LOCK_UN);
                        }
                    }
                }
                fclose($handle);
            }
        }
    }
   
    return $return;
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you don't want use secondary lock file while truncating, try this:

<?php

$fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "a+");

if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) { // do an exclusive lock
   ftruncate($fp, 0);
   fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
   flock($fp, LOCK_UN); // release the lock
} else {
   echo "Couldn't lock the file !";
}

fclose($fp);

?>
===============================================================================

I just spend a long time to understand why write function returns me "0", on a
basic file opening and then writing.

I discovered that if you use LOCK_SH and then you write something, that will
not work :

<?php
$fp = fopen('file.txt', 'a');

flock($fp,LOCK_SH);

$written = fputs($fp, 'data');

var_dump($written); // 0 and file is not changed

fclose($fp);
?>
===============================================================================

Because:
1) flock() is not safe if multiple php sessions are simultaneously locking.
2) fopen( , 'a') is not safe if multiple php sessions are simultaneously
appending.
3) usleep and sleep are known for having problems.

I wrote the Weblog function, it's purpose is to append a line to logging. This
function handles the concurrency as follows:
- Try to create a lockfile named: $directory . date('Ymd') . $logfile . 1 .
lock
- If this fails, try to create lockfile named: $directory . date('Ymd') .
$logfile . 2 . lock
- etc. After 100 tries return false.

- When the lockfile is acquired the file named: $directory.date
('Ymd').$logfile.1 (or .2 or .3 or .25) is opened or created.
- If created the a "extended log file" header is written.
- Write out the line.
- Close the flie and if created set the correct access rights. (I had some
problems creating files on a webserver, I did not see them when I opened a FTP
session to the webdirectory. The chmod did the trick for me).

- Remove the lockfile.

There is only one drawback, multiple logfiles are created.
e.g. (executed on 15 september 2010)
    Weblog('./' , 'visit', 'Somebody requested the index page');
Could lead to 100 files, depending how many concurrent php sessions are
simultaneously trying to append a logline:
./20100915visit.1
./20100915visit.2
./20100915visit.3
./20100915visit.4
...
./20100915visit.100

This function is donated to the public domain. Maybe you can give me some
credit by leaving in the author comment, but it is not required. You may modify
this as you wish.
(This function was inspired by the function m_lock_file presented by Kuzma dot
Deretuke at gmail dot com)

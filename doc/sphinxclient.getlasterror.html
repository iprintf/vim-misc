SphinxClient::getLastError — Get the last error message

说明

public string SphinxClient::getLastError ( void )

Returns string with the last error message. If there were no errors during the
previous API call, empty string is returned. This method doesn't reset the
error message, so you can safely call it several times.

===============================================================================

Note that getLastError() doesn't work if you run multiple queries with
runQueries(). It doesn't return any error, even if one or several (or all) of
the queries failed.

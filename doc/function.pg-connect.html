pg_connect

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_connect — 打开一个 PostgreSQL 连接

说明

resource pg_connect ( string $connection_string )

pg_connect() 返回其它 PostgreSQL 函数所需要的资源。

pg_connect() 打开一个由 connection_string 所指定的 PostgreSQL 数据库的连接。如
果成功则返回连接资源，如果不能连接则返回 FALSE。connection_string 应该是用引号
引起来的字符串。

Example #1 使用 pg_connect()

<?php
$dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");
//connect to a database named "mary"
$dbconn2 = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mary");
// connect to a database named "mary" on "localhost" at port "5432"
$dbconn3 = pg_connect("host=sheep port=5432 dbname=mary user=lamb password=foo"
);
//
connect to a database named "mary" on the host "sheep" with a username and password

$conn_string = "host=sheep port=5432 dbname=test user=lamb password=bar";
$dbconn4 = pg_connect($conn_string);
//
connect to a database named "test" on the host "sheep" with a username and password
?>
connection_string 所包括的参数有 host，port，tty, options，dbname, user 和
password。

如果用同样的 connection_string 再次调用 pg_connect()，不会建立新连接，而是返回
前面已经打开的连接资源。如果使用不同的连接字符串，则可以和同一个数据库建立多个
连接。

旧的多参数语法 $conn = pg_connect("host", "port", "options", "tty", "dbname")
已经不提倡使用。

参见 pg_pconnect()，pg_close()，pg_host()，pg_port(), pg_tty()，pg_options() 和
pg_dbname()。

Getting md5 passwords was confusing because of a lack of documentation:

- set up your pg_hba.conf in order to use md5 password instead of 'trust' or
'ident'
- check if your postgres.conf has 'password_encryption=on' (depending on the
version this might already be 'on').
- make sure to restart your postgres process.
- in PHP you just supply the username and password in _plain_ text:
'host=localhost port=5432 dbname=megadb user=megauser password=
holyhandbagsbatmanthispasswordisinplaintext'
The postgres PHP library will automagically do the md5 encoding for you, no
need to do it yourself.
===============================================================================

If you use pgbouncer and unix socket
and you pgbouncer.ini looks like this
listen_port = 6432
unix_socket_dir = /tmp

you connect like this

pg_connect('host=/tmp port=6432 dbname=DB user=USER password=PASS');
===============================================================================

Beware about writing something like
<?php
function getdb_FAILS() {
    return pg_connect("...") or die('connection failed');
}
?>

It will return a boolean.  This will appear to be fine if you don't use the
return value as a db connection handle, but will fail if you do.

Instead, use:
<?php
function getdb() {
    $db = pg_connect("...") or die('connection failed');
    return $db;
}
?>

which actually returns a handle.
===============================================================================

if you need to open a new connection handle (i.e. for multiple pg_send_query())
use PGSQL_CONNECT_FORCE_NEW as second parameter to pg_connect()
===============================================================================

One thing is to remember, whenever trying to use pg_connect, add the timeout
parameter with it

<?php
$d=pg_connect('host=example.com user=pgsql dbname=postgres connect_timeout=5');
?>
===============================================================================

The values accepted by pg_connect's sslmode argument are: disable, allow,
prefer, require
===============================================================================

Little note that is buried in the install somewhere.  In Php 3, PostgreSQL
support was activated by adding --with-postgresql=[DIR] to the options passed
to ./configure.  With Php 4.0.2 (on Linux) the parameter was --with-pgsql.  The
only place I found this was in the installing PHP on Unix section of the
manual.
===============================================================================

If you use PostgreSQL users for authenticating into your pg database rather
than using your own authentication, always specify host directive in pg_connect
and edit pg_hba.conf to authenticate from this host accordingly. Otherwise, PHP
will connect as 'local' using UNIX domain sockets, which is set in pg_hba.conf
to 'trust' by default (so you can connect using psql on console without
specifying password) and everyone can connect to db _without password_ .
===============================================================================

It's not explicitly stated here, but you can also connect to PostgreSQL via a
UNIX domain socket by leaving the host empty.  This should have less overhead
than using TCP e.g.:

$dbh = new PDO('pgsql:user=exampleuser dbname=exampledb password=examplepass');

In fact as the C library call PQconnectdb underlies this implementation, you
can supply anything that this library call would take - the "pgsql:" prefix
gets stripped off before PQconnectdb is called, and if you supply any of the
optional arguments (e.g. user), then these arguments will be added to the
string that you supplied...  Check the docs for your relevant PostgreSQL client
library: e.g.

http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/libpq-connect.html

If you really want, you can use ';'s to separate your arguments - these will
just be converted to spaces before PQconnectdb is called.

===============================================================================

It's possible connect to a PostgreSQL database via Unix socket using the
pg_connect() function by the following two ways:

1) Using the socket path:

<?php
$conn = pg_connect('host=/var/run/postgresql user=username dbname=databasename'
);
?>

2) Omitting the host name/path:

<?php
$conn = pg_connect('user=username dbname=databasename');
?>

Note: in this case (omitting the host value), the default socket path will be
used.
===============================================================================

I got the same problem but I have to solve that in different way.
In my postgresql.conf file the following was commented.
So, I active that under Connection Settings-

# - Connection Settings –
tcpip_socket = true
===============================================================================

If you use pg_connect('host=localhost port=5432 user=my_username password=
my_password dbname=my_dbname') and you get the following error:
"Warning: pg_connect(): Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not
connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host localhost
and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?"
then you should try to leave the host= and port= parts out of the connection
string. This sounds strange, but this is an "option" of Postgre. If you have
not activated the TCP/IP port in postgresql.conf then postgresql doesn't accept
any incoming requests from an TCP/IP port. If you use host= in your connection
string you are going to connect to Postgre via TCP/IP, so that's not going to
work. If you leave the host= part out of your connection string you connect to
Postgre via the Unix domain sockets, which is faster and more secure, but you
can't connect with the database via any other PC as the localhost.
===============================================================================

pg_connect seems to support SSL connections, on systems where Postgres has been
compiled with ssl, i'm assuming this is since psql uses libpq to connect.
pg_connect can successfully connect, and use the "requiressl" argument.
===============================================================================

"If you use pg_connect('host=localhost port=5432 user=my_username password=
my_password dbname=my_dbname') and you get the following error:
"Warning: pg_connect(): Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not
connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host localhost
and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?"
"
I solved this error just by setting listen_addresses = '*' in the
postgresql.conf file. This error occurs probably despite of a name resolution
to localhost, given in the "host" parameter. So you can set the host in the
pg_connect() function.
===============================================================================

regarding the note from  matias at nospam dot projectcast dot com
on 12-Feb-2002 01:16, you do not need a user in the database with the same name
a your web user with ANY version of postgresql.  The only time that would be a
requirement ifs if you set your postgresql server to only allow IDENT based
authentication  (which IIRC is the default on Red Hat systems, which might be
what lead to the confusion).  For more info on the various authentication
methods allowed by postgresql, check out http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/
static/client-authentication.html
===============================================================================

If you use host=HOSTNAME in your pg_connect string when connecting to
PostgreSQL databases newer than 7.1, you need to make sure that your postmaster
daemon is started with the "-i" option.  Otherwise the connection will fail. 
See http://www.postgresql.org/idocs/index.php?client-authentication.html for
client authentication documentation.
===============================================================================

At least with Postgres 7.2, connecting to local postgresdatabase requires a
user in the database with the same name as the user running apache, or the
connection fails.
===============================================================================

pg_connect() won't work with the authentication method 'crypt' in the
pg_hba.conf. Took me an hour to figure that out till I remeberd some other
issues with windows missing the crypt() call.
===============================================================================

If you get the following warning :
"Warning: pg_connect(): Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not
translate host name "server.your.trying.to.connect.to" to address:"
and the server you are trying to connect to is fine and the connecting itself
should be working fine,
it might be the case that the postgres extension for PHP might be confused
about something.
Try to restart your Apache to reinitialize the extension.
===============================================================================

It's strange how this "Fatal error: Call to undefined function pg_connect()"
happens(when everything else is OK) in PHP version 5.3.3.

I was trying to connect to my db when I got that error message the firs time.
My extensions path was OK, pgsql extension  should have been loaded from
php.ini(i had enabled it before), Apache started-up without errors, but i still
had the "Fatal error: Call to undefined function pg_connect()" message when i
tried to connect.
Seaching a bit around i found something about dll libraries not working as they
should, so deleted the new 5.3.3 version, downloaded the PHP 5.2.5 and
configured it.

I'm using Windows XP Home SP3, Apache 2.2, PHP 5.2.5 and everything works fine
now... ;)
===============================================================================

Ubuntu/Debian users, specifically server versions: If you used Tasksel to build
PostgreSQL, and you're banging your head against the wall with the "Fatal
error: Call to undefined function pg_connect()" error, check that php5-pgsql is
installed.

Tasksel apparently doesn't install it.
===============================================================================

remember that when you use a blank password there will be an error because of:
password= dbname= (...)
to fix this problem use '' in your $options variable
example:

$options = " host='localhost' port='5432' user='postgres' password='' dbname=
'test' ";
pg_connect($options);

*** careful: I used double ' after password=, not "

dbx_fetch_row

(PHP 5 <= 5.0.5, PECL dbx >= 1.1.0)

dbx_fetch_row — Fetches rows from a query-result that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set

说明

mixed dbx_fetch_row ( object $result_identifier )

dbx_fetch_row() fetches rows from a result identifier that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set.

When the DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED is not set in the query, dbx_fetch_row() will
fail as all rows have already been fetched into the results data property.

As a side effect, the rows property of the query-result object is incremented
for each successful call to dbx_fetch_row().

参数

result_identifier

    A result set returned by dbx_query().

返回值

Returns an object on success that contains the same information as any row
would have in the dbx_query() result data property, including columns
accessible by index or fieldname when the flags for dbx_query() were set that
way.

Upon failure, returns 0 (e.g. when no more rows are available).

范例

Example #1 How to handle the returned value

<?php
$result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table', 
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED);

echo "<table>\n";
while ($row = dbx_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo "<tr>\n";
    foreach ($row as $field) {
        echo "<td>$field</td>";
    }
    echo "</tr>\n";
}
echo "</table>\n";
?>

===============================================================================

Use this function ONLY if you are using:
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED

and make sure the database you're using will allow DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED as a
flag on the connect line.

I spent 2 days trying to figure out WHY I couldn't use the dbx_fetch_row()
function.  Too many languages!

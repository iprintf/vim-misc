ibase_fetch_row — Fetch a row from an InterBase database

说明

array ibase_fetch_row ( resource $result_identifier [, int $fetch_flag = 0 ] )

ibase_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the given result set.

Subsequent calls to ibase_fetch_row() return the next row in the result set, or
FALSE if there are no more rows.

参数

result_identifier

    An InterBase result identifier.

fetch_flag

    fetch_flag is a combination of the constants IBASE_TEXT and IBASE_UNIXTIME
    ORed together. Passing IBASE_TEXT will cause this function to return BLOB
    contents instead of BLOB ids. Passing IBASE_UNIXTIME will cause this
    function to return date/time values as Unix timestamps instead of as
    formatted strings.

返回值

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset
0.

If you have a query

"select ... from table1 where ..."

and would like to know the cardinality of the result set by issuing a separate
query

"select count(*) from table1 where ..."

then you might end up with an incorrect value since an insert or delete can
occur between the running of these queries (unlikely, but possible).
The only way i can think of getting the correct value would be something along
the lines of

<?php

$qry = "select ... from table1 where ...";
$result = ibase_query($tr, $qry) // assume $tr is a transaction

$count = 0;
while ($row[$count] = ibase_fetch_assoc($result))
    $count++;

?>

then $count is the cardinality, and $row the result set.
Then you can work with the result set:

<?php

for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++)
{
  // do something with $row[$i]
}

?>

I had some troubles with moving php application from one dbase to another. From
SyBase to Interbase.
Especially with missing function "ibase_num_rows($result)".

These are functions that helped me.
<?php
...
$dbh = ibase_connect ($host, $username, $password);
...
$ar_count_queries = array();

function ibasequery($query) {
  $cquery = preg_replace("/SELECT(.*?)FROM(.*?)/","SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \\2",
$query);
  if ($cquery != $query) {
   $crow=get_object_vars( ibase_fetch_object( ibase_query( $GLOBALS["dbh"], 
$cquery ) ) );
   }
  @$res = ibase_query($GLOBALS["dbh"],$query);
  if (isset($res)) {
    if (isset($crow)) {
     $GLOBALS["ar_count_queries"][$res] = $radcountselect["COUNT"];
    }
    return $res;
  }
   return false;
}

function ibasenumrows($result) {
  return $GLOBALS["ar_count_queries"][$res];
}

function ibasefetchrow($result) {
  return get_object_vars(ibase_fetch_object($result));
}

// example
$result = ibasequery("SELECT * FROM TABLE");
$numrows = ibasenumrows($result);
echo "Number of rows: $numrows.\nContent: \n";
while ($onerow = ibasefetchrow($res)) {
  foreach($onerow as $key => $value) {
    echo $key.": ".$value.", ";
  }
  echo "\n";
}
?>

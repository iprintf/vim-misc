posix_getgrgid

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

posix_getgrgid — Return info about a group by group id

说明

array posix_getgrgid ( int $gid )

Gets information about a group provided its id.

参数

gid

    The group id.

返回值

The array elements returned are:

                          The group information array
Element                               Description
        The name element contains the name of the group. This is a short,
name    usually less than 16 character "handle" of the group, not the real,
        full name.
        The passwd element contains the group's password in an encrypted
passwd  format. Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords, an
        asterisk is returned instead.
gid     Group ID, should be the same as the gid parameter used when calling the
        function, and hence redundant.
members This consists of an array of string's for all the members in the group.

范例

Example #1 Example use of posix_getgrgid()

<?php

$groupid   = posix_getegid();
$groupinfo = posix_getgrgid($groupid);

print_r($groupinfo);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [name]    => toons
    [passwd]  => x
    [members] => Array
        (
            [0] => tom
            [1] => jerry
        )
    [gid]     => 42
)

===============================================================================

When posix_getgrgid() fails (e.g. an invalid/unknown group id), it returns
false.
This is except for Mac OSX on which you get an array with name "nogroup" and
gid of "-1".
===============================================================================

in php-4.3 the array returned seems to have changed.

it now returns:

["name"] group name
["passwd"] group password
["members"] group members (array of usernames)
["gid"] numeric group id
===============================================================================

okies...

This code should be considered as an OPTION only, it works under MY set of
circumstances, and that is all I intended. The below funtion will return the
NAME of the GROUP if provided with the Group ID#

  function RC_posix_getgrgid($gid)
    {
    $LocationGroup = "/etc/group"; //EDIT THIS IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OS. mine
= debian
    $fp = fopen ("/etc/group","r");
    while ($groupinfo = fscanf ($fp, "%[a-zA-Z0-9]:x:%[0-9]:%[a-zA-Z0-9]\n"))
        {
        list ($name, $groupID, $nfi) = $groupinfo;
        if ($groupID == $gid)
            {
            $returnval = $name;
            }
        }
    fclose($fp);
    if($returnval) { return $returnval; } else { return 0; }
    }
===============================================================================

Returns an array containing the elements of the group structure. The array has
both numeric indices, each of which is a string naming one member of the group,
and named string indices. The array elements are:

$_["name"]  string groupname (users)
$_["gid"] integer gidnumber (e.g. 0 for wheel/root)
$_["members"] int number of users in group
$_[0]..$_[n] string usernames in the group

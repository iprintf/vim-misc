If you want to disable an account in an Active Directory of Windows,
you may try this (it works for me in a Win2k environment):

(foo.bar should be replaced in "$ldapBase" to the correct
domain, e.g. "DC=phpfreackx,DC=com" if your domain is phpfreackx.com)

domctrl = domain controller
domadlogin = domain admin login
domadpw = domain admin password
username = loginname of useraccount (e.g. "john.doe")
enable =1 (if you want to enable it, 0 if it should be disabled)

<?php
function userchange($username,$enable=1,$domadlogin,$domadpw,$domctrl)
{
$ldapServer = $domctrl;
$ldapBase = 'DC=foo,DC=bar';
$ds = ldap_connect($ldapServer);
if (!$ds) {die('Cannot Connect to LDAP server');}
$ldapBind = ldap_bind($ds,$domadlogin,$domadpw);
if (!$ldapBind) {die('Cannot Bind to LDAP server');}
ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
$sr = ldap_search($ds, $ldapBase, "(samaccountname=$username)");
$ent= ldap_get_entries($ds,$sr);
$dn=$ent[0]["dn"];
// Deactivate
$ac = $ent[0]["useraccountcontrol"][0];
$disable=($ac |  2); // set all bits plus bit 1 (=dec2)
$enable =($ac & ~2); // set all bits minus bit 1 (=dec2)
$userdata=array();
if ($enable==1) $new=$enable; else $new=$disable; //enable or disable?
$userdata["useraccountcontrol"][0]=$new;
ldap_modify($ds, $dn, $userdata); //change state
$sr = ldap_search($ds, $ldapBase, "(samaccountname=$username)");
$ent= ldap_get_entries($ds,$sr);
$ac = $ent[0]["useraccountcontrol"][0];
if (($ac & 2)==2) $status=0; else $status=1;
ldap_close($ds);
return $status; //return current status (1=enabled, 0=disabled)
}  

// use this to disable an account:
// userchange('john.doe@foo.bar',0,'admin@foo.bar',
'secret','domctrl.foo.bar');
// ..but this to enable it:
// userchange('john.doe@foo.bar',1,'admin@foo.bar',
'secret','domctrl.foo.bar');

If you are trying to change the userPassword attribute when using md5 hashes,
try the following lines:

$new["userPassword"] = '{md5}' . base64_encode(pack('H*', md5
($newpass_in_plaintext)));
ldap_modify($ds, $dn, $new);

Some comments on ldap_modify, and especially the user comment from tengel at
fluid dot com

OpenLDAP 2.1.22
If an attribute is tagged as MUST in the schema, the attribute must be there.
Wheter it may contain and empty value depends on the SYNTAX for that attribute.

DirectoryString MAY NOT be empty; OctetString MAY be empty. As far as I can
see, IA5String MAY NOT be empty.

If an attribute is defined as MAY in the schema, the attribute may or may not
be there. If it is there, it MAY or MAY NOT be empty, depending on its SYNTAX.

PHP 4.3.1

It seems that ldap_modify() will take an array of attributes to modify.

For multivalued attributes, passing an empty array, wil DELETE the attribute,
regardless of it's previous value(s), and regardless if the attribute was there
before the modify.

If the multivalued attribute is defined as MAY, this will work. If the
attribute is defined as MUST, OpenLDAP will generate the error: 'LDAP error 65:
Object class violation'

If an attribute's SYNTAX defines that it MAY NOT be empty, trying to add or
modify the attribute with an empty value will genereate the error: 'LDAP error
21: Invalid syntax'.
Also, in the logfile, if set with sufficient debuglevel, the string

    value #0 invalid per syntax

will be present.

Trying to pass an empty array to ldap_add() for a any attribute (multi or
single valued) will result in the error 'LDAP error 2: Protocol error',
regardless if the attribute is defined as MUST or MAY.

Note that this differs form passing an array with elements that have no value.
In the latter case, it depends on the SYNTAX for that attribute if that is
allowed.

If the attribute is single-valued, passing an array with one element, WILL
change the value of the attribute. In the user comments on php.net it is
suggested that if you want to modify a single valued attribute, you must pass a
string, not an array with one element. My experience is that an array with a
single element will work just as well.

Nick T.'s comment above is out of date.
The PHP LDAP interface currently supports direct modification of the DN using
the ldap_rename() function.
===============================================================================

If You can`t add attribute objectclass to existing object  using ldap_modify -
use ldap_mod_add - it works.
===============================================================================

Following goetz at rvs dot uni-hannover dot de's comment, it is not exactly
true that ldap_modify can't change objectclass.

In fact, it's impossible to add an objectclass which is set as STRUCTURAL in
the schema description. But you can add an objectclass set as AUXILIARY. See
OpenLDAP FAQ below for explanation why :

http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1341.html

For example, if you have an ldap entry of type "device", which is a structural
objectclass, named "cn=myNetCard,ou=Networks,dc=example,dc=com", you can do
this :

<?php

$entry["objectclass"][0] = "device";
$entry["objectclass"][1] = "ieee802Device"; // add an auxiliary objectclass
$entry["macAddress"][0] = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff";

ldap_modify ($cnx, "cn=myNetCard,ou=Networks,dc=example,dc=com", $entry);
?>

But this will not work :

<?php

$entry["objectclass"][0] = "device";
$entry["objectclass"][1] = "ipNetwork"; // add a structural objectclass
$entry["ipNetworkNumber"][0] = "1.2.3.4";

ldap_modify ($cnx, "cn=myNetCard,ou=Networks,dc=example,dc=com", $entry);
?>

You will get the following error : "Cannot modify object class"
===============================================================================

If you're seeing confusing "Type or value exists" errors from ldap_modify, the
reason could be that you're attempting to add two identical values for a
multi-valued attribute.  ie, something like:

<?php
$le = array("mail" => array("foo@bar.com", "foo@bar.com"));
$result = ldap_modify($ldap_link, $dn, $le);
?>
===============================================================================

If you're writing a multiple values for an attribute with ldap_modify (), the
function will attempt to write all entries in the value array even if those
entries are blank.  Setting blank entries to a blank array in the manner used
for attribute deletion, ie:

$attributes[$attr_name][3] = array ();

results in the string "Array" being written to the directory for that value. 
The only way I was able to find to do what I wanted - only write the values for
the attribute that were submitted on the form - was to check if each attribute
had multiple values and unset () blank values, eg:

                foreach ($attributes as $key => $cur_val) {
                        if ($cur_val== '') {
                                $attributes[$key] = array ();
                        }
                        if (is_array ($cur_val)) {
                                foreach ($cur_val as $mv_key => $mv_cur_val) {
                                       
                                        if ($mv_cur_val == '') {
                                                unset ($attributes[$key]
[$mv_key]);
                                        }
                                        else {
                                                $attributes[$key][$mv_key] =
$mv_cur_val;                     
                                        }
                                }
                        }
                }
===============================================================================

To pinpoint the delete issue:

with newer OpenLdap versions this will fail:

$values["mail"] = "";
ldap_modify($conn_id, $dn, $values);

or
$values["mail"][0] = "";
ldap_modify($conn_id, $dn, $values);

BUT this works:

$values["mail"] = array();
ldap_modify($conn_id, $dn, $values);

or
$values["mail"][0] = array();
ldap_modify($conn_id, $dn, $values);
===============================================================================

The $entry parameter can be an array of values for an attribute. Just be
careful that your array's indices are numerically contiguous. For example, when
using this $entry array, ldap_modify will fail with little explanation:

   $entry = array( 0 => 'foo', 2 => 'bar' );

While this one will work just fine:

   $entry = array( 0 => 'foo', 1 => 'bar' );

Hope this helps someone out.
===============================================================================

Remember that you can NOT modify the attribute 'objectclass' with ldap_modify!

If you use a search result as basis for your changes, be sure to 'unset()' all
numbered indices, 'count' indicies AND index 'objectclass' !
===============================================================================

To delete entries:

$data["description"] = array();
ldap_modify($conn, $dn,$data);
===============================================================================

The behaviour of OpenLDAP from 1.x to 2.x changed; in 1.x, when you passed
ldap_modify the array, if the value was empty that attribute would be deleted. 
In 2.x, you get an "Invalid Syntax" error and the modify fails.

This requires the ldap_mod_del function; unfortunately, that operation requires
the attribute to be deleted have it's *old* value specified -- as you can
imagine, if you're taking input from a CGI form, the attribute to be deleted's
value is now missing (i.e., the user blanked out that textbox in the form and
clicked Submit).

So, you're in a bit of a conundrum -- you want to delete "empty" form values,
but you need their old value to delete them.  There are many ways to handle
this, but I chose this approach:

<?php
// The first is what to add, the second to remove
$entry=array();
$delval=array();

// Imagine if you will, $o and $title are
// form fields with text boxes for data
if($o!="") { $entry["o"]="$o"; } else { $delval[]="o"; }
if($title!="") { $entry["title"]="$title"; } else { $delval[]="title"; }

// First try the normal modify with $entry
// $ldap, $dn, $BASEDN are all set up earlier
if (@ldap_modify($ldap, $dn, $entry)) {
  // then do the dirty work
  $filter = sprintf("(&(uid=%s)(sn=%s))",$uid,$sn);
  $sres = ldap_search($ldap, $BASEDN, $filter, $delval);
  $delent = ldap_first_entry($ldap, $sres);
  $delarr = ldap_get_attributes($ldap, $delent);
  $findel=array();
  for($i=0; $i<$delarr["count"]; $i++) {
    $attr = $delarr[$i];
    $totl = $delarr[$attr]["count"];
    for($z=0; $z<$totl; $z++) {
      if ($totl = 1) {
        $findel[$attr]=$delarr[$attr][$z];
      } else {
        $findel[$attr][$z]=$delarr[$attr][$z];
      }
    }
  }
  if(@ldap_mod_del($ldap, $dn, $findel)) {
    print("<H3>Modified Entry!</H3>\n");
    print("<BR>\n");
  } else {
    $error=ldap_error($ldap);
    print("<H3>Attribute Delete Failed!</H3>\n");
    print("<BR>\n($error)\n");
  }
} else {
  $error=ldap_error($ldap);
  print("<H3>Modify Failed!</H3>\n");
  print("<BR>\n($error)\n");
}
?>

Modifying existing LDAP information using ldap_modify()

The link_identifier must result from a call to connect to the server with
authority to update entries, usually requiring an authenticated bind - ie you
provide a suitable dn and password in the ldap_bind() call.

The  dn  must be a single specific dn that exists on the LDAP server.   There
is no wildcard mechanism in LDAP to globally change multiple dn entries.  

The entry array must be in one of two different forms, according to whether
just one entry is to be stored in the directory for a particular attribute, or
whether multiple entries are to be stored for the attribute.

Where a single entry is to be stored for an attribute - say just a single email
address - then you use the general form

             <?php $newinfo[ <attribute_name> ]="whatever" ; ?>

for example ...

             <?php $newinfo["mail"]="john@myorg.com" ; ?>

Where multiple entries are to be stored for an attribute  -  say a number of
email addresses for one person  -  then you use the general form

             <?php
             $newinfo[ <attribute_name> ][0] = "whatever" ;
             $newinfo[ <attribute_name> ][1] = "another" ;
             ?>

for example ...

             <?php
             $newinfo["mail"][0]="johnw@myorg.com" ;
             $newinfo["mail"][1]="jwaterson@somewhere.org" ;
             ?>

Further notes on ldap_modify()

The modify call leaves entries for all other attributes unaltered.   So if you
just want to update the entry for the "mail" attribute, then all that is
required is:

     <?php
     $newinfo[mail]="nick@county.gov.uk";
     ldap_modify($valid_ldaplink, $valid_dn, $newinfo);
     ?>

However, if there were multiple entries for the mail attribute present on the
LDAP database when you run the above code, then all the existing mail entries
would be deleted and be replaced by the single "mail" entry.

If you have reason to expect multiple values for a particular attribute (more
that one email entry, for example) you should make sure you read all the
entries from the ldap server first, and then save a modified array.

The PHP LDAP interface does not currently support direct modification of the
dn.  If the dn needs changing, the only option is to read all entries for the
dn and save these to a new, modified, dn before deleting the complete entry for
the original dn.

I ran into a rather annoying issue when trying to add a user to a usergroup in
Active Directory.

Active Directory tends to not be particularly happy when you try modifying the
"memberOf" attribute (through ldap_mod_add/ldap_mod_replace), and will output a
warning/error somewhere along the lines of:

Warning: ldap_mod_add(): Modify: Server is unwilling to perform in ...

If you want to add a user to a usergroup, you need to add the user as a member
of the group, rather than adding to the memberOf attribute of the group:

<?php
    function ldap_addToGroup($username, $group) {
        $dn = "CN=$group,OU=Accounts,DC=DC1,DC=DC2"; // distinguished name/DN
of the group you want to add to
        $info["member"] = "CN=$username,OU=Accounts,DC=DC1,DC=DC2"; // DN of
the user you want to add
        return ldap_modify($ldapconn, $dn, $info);
    }
?>

Hope this helps someone.

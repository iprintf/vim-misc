streamWrapper::stream_seek

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.2, PHP 5, PHP 7)

streamWrapper::stream_seek — Seeks to specific location in a stream

说明

public bool streamWrapper::stream_seek ( int $offset , int $whence = SEEK_SET )

This method is called in response to fseek().

The read/write position of the stream should be updated according to the offset
and whence.

参数

offset

    The stream offset to seek to.

whence

    Possible values:
      □ SEEK_SET - Set position equal to offset bytes.
      □ SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus offset.
      □ SEEK_END - Set position to end-of-file plus offset.

返回值

Return TRUE if the position was updated, FALSE otherwise.

注释

    Note:

    If not implemented, FALSE is assumed as the return value.

    Note:

    Upon success, streamWrapper::stream_tell() is called directly after calling
    streamWrapper::stream_seek(). If streamWrapper::stream_tell() fails, the
    return value to the caller function will be set to FALSE

    Note:

    Not all seeks operations on the stream will result in this function being
    called. PHP streams have read buffering enabled by default (see also 
    stream_set_read_buffer()) and seeking may be done by merely moving the
    buffer pointer.

===============================================================================

Please notice that the return value of this function is a boolean but the
return value of fseek is 0 for ok and -1 for failure.

Please use this implementation when working with files:

function stream_seek($offset, $whence) {
        if(0 === fseek($this->_handler, $offset, $whence)){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
}

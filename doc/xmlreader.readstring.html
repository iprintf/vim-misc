===============================================================================

For those who, like me, are having trouble figuring out the difference between
getString() an getInnerXML(), the difference is that getString() does NOT
include markup.  So, for:

<foo>bar<baz>Hello, world!</baz></foo>

getString() on the <foo> node would return

bar Hello, world!

whereas getInnerXML() would return

bar<baz>Hello, world!</baz>
===============================================================================

I would like to reiterate that this does not work when compiled with versions
of libxml lower than 20620. I found that it just presents a blank page.

<?php $string = $reader->readString(); ?>

I worked around this issue by adding the following helper function:

<?php
function read_string($reader) {
    $node = $reader->expand();
    return $node->textContent;
}
?>

And then using:

<?php $string = read_string($reader); ?>

KTaglib_ID3v2_AttachedPictureFrame::getMimeType — Returns the mime type of the
picture

说明

public string KTaglib_ID3v2_AttachedPictureFrame::getMimeType ( void )

Returns the mime type of the image represented by the attached picture frame.

Please notice that this method might return different types. While ID3v2.2 have
a mime type that doesn't start with "image/", ID3v2.3 and v2.4 usually start
with "image/". Therefore the method might return "image/png" for IDv2.3 frames
and just "PNG" for ID3v2.2 frames.

Notice that even the frame is an attached picture, the mime type might not be
set and therefore an empty string might be returned.

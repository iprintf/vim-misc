===============================================================================

There is an issue that may be meant or not, but in my case is annoying. If you
have have a schema like the following:

[code]
pragma foreign_key = on;
create table parent (
  id integer,
  a varchar,
  primary key (id asc)
);
create table child (
  id integer,
  b varchar,
  a integer,
  primary key (id asc),
  foreign key (a) references a (id) on delete cascade on update cascade
);
[/code]

When you try to delete a parent row (delete from parent where parent.id=?) it
deletes all the childs referenced to this parent, but the method
SQLite3::changes() is still returning 1, as if it only have deleted the parent.
===============================================================================

It seems, that this method doesn't report the affected rows properly, when
using with savepoints or a transaction.

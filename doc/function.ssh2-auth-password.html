===============================================================================

Please note that the function ssh2_auth_password raises PHP warning(!) on bad
authentication. To avoid the warning, use the "silence" ("@") operator.

<?php
$ssh = ssh2_connect($host);
if (false === $ssh) {
    die('connection failed');
}

$auth = @ssh2_auth_password($ssh, $user, $password);
if (false === $auth) {
    die('authentication failed');
}
?>
===============================================================================

This function is useful for authenticating website clients against local (or
remote) Unix users.

I'd played around with Apache+PAM, various mod_auths and homebrewed shell
programs and even NIS, but to authenticate a user against a Unix shadow file
fundamentally requires root priviledges, so either your PHP script needs root
or an external program needs it's sticky bit set.  Both of these have *serious*
security implications.

Using SSH, the overhead is obviously going to be greater but you're trusting a
root service that's been (and continues to be) really well tested.  Just try
authing with SSH against localhost (or another host if you want).
===============================================================================

Do not try to authenticate or log in more than once on a ssh2 connection. It
won't work. You'll need a new connection via ssh2_connect() which will result
in a poor performance if you're doing several connects to the same server.

I had the most trouble with figureing out what the message list was supposed to
be.  There was one comment by jan@showstar.com but i was still terribly
confused.  So I searched and searched and searched.  I read rfc2060 over 10
times.  Then BAM!  My brother found it here:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2060.html#sec-6.4.7

Here is the importand stuff.

Another important field is the SEQUENCE, which identifies a set of messages by
consecutive numbers from 1 to n where n is the number of messages in the
mailbox.  A sequence may consist of a single number, a pair of numbers
delimited by colon (equivalent to all numbers between those two numbers), or a
list of single numbers or number pairs.  For example, the sequence
2,4:7,9,12:15 is equivalent to
   2,4,5,6,7,9,12,13,14,15 and identifies all those messages.

There is what I know about it.  BAM!
===============================================================================

After using imap_mail_move, imap_mail_copy or imap_delete it is necesary to
call imap_expunge() function.
===============================================================================

To copy/move a mail in Gmail to a particular Folder like Starred/Spam/Drafts/
Trash

use the following statement and don't forget to call CL_EXPUNGE or imap_expunge
($mbox) after it.

<?php
imap_mail_copy($mbox,'16','[Gmail]/Starred'); // 16 is the message number,
which can also be a range.(ex: '1:15')

imap_close($mbox,CL_EXPUNGE);
?>

Incase u want to send it to a personally created Label/folder(ex: Test) use..

<?php
imap_mail_copy($mbox,'16','Test');
imap_expunge($mbox);
imap_close($mbox);
?>
===============================================================================

to complete the previous example, if the mbox/folders names are
{imap.free.fr}INBOX
{imap.free.fr}INBOX/draft
{imap.free.fr}INBOX/test

and you want to copy/move from INBOX to INBOX/test this is the syntax:

$mbox = imap_open("{imap.free.fr}INBOX",$mailuser,$mailpass)
      or die("can't connect: ".imap_last_error());
...
imap_mail_move($mbox,$messageset,"INBOX/test");

Hope this could help !
===============================================================================

I've used a dot in
imap_mail_move($mbox,$movmsgid,'INBOX.send');
instead of
INBOX/test
and it work's fine.
===============================================================================

I offer the following example because it took me HOURS to figure this out

<?php
$this->mailInBox = imap_open($this->mailConnectString."INBOX", $this->
accountLogin, $this->accountPassword);

            $this->messageCount = imap_num_msg($this->mailInBox);
            echo "Processing " . $this->messageCount . " messages:<Br>";
            for ($i = 1; $i <= $this->messageCount; ++$i) {
                $header = imap_header($this->mailInBox, $i);
                               
                $prettydate = date("jS F Y", $header->udate);
                $fromHost = $header->from[0]->host;
               
                if (isset($header->from[0]->personal)) {
                    $personal = $header->from[0]->personal;
                } else {
                    $personal = $header->from[0]->mailbox;
                }
               
                $body = imap_fetchbody($this->mailInBox, $i, "1.1");
                if ($body == "") {
                   $body = imap_fetchbody($this->mailInBox, $i, "1");
                }

                    $move = "INBOX.processed" . date("Ymd");
                    echo "trying to move:" . $i . "<br>";
                    @imap_mail_move($this->mailInBox, $i, $move);
                                       
                }

?>
===============================================================================

This function works, just not like everything else IMAP in PHP3... rather than
feeding the server {server.ext/type:port}folder just feed it the folder's name.
===============================================================================

This function copies the mail and then marks the source as deleted.  In order
to see the changes, you must imap_expunge the source box.
===============================================================================

To move mails via IMAP on an Exchange Server into "Gel schte Objekte" use:

imap_mail_move($mbox, $delmsg, "Gel&APY-schte Objekte");

It took me some tcpdumping to get this out, since both
imap_utf7_encode and
imap_utf8

did not translate it right.

===============================================================================

This keeps biting me time after time. A lot of IMAP servers with quotas don't
implement 'move' right - they do a 'copy&delete' instead and don't recognize
that this conflicts with their quota implementetions. So, if you try to move a
large message, you'll exceed your quota even though moving it does not increase
the total size of your mailbox. This is not PHP-specific, but I bet it'll bite
someone else besides me, so here you go.
===============================================================================

The syntax for the message list is defined in RFC2060
It is a string, containing a list of message numbers and ranges, separated by
commas (no spaces anywhere.) For example, "1,2,5,11:15,19" would be accepted by
imap_mail_copy or imap_mail_move.
A range of messages is defined as two message numbers separated by a colon (Ex.
"1:10".) Also, a "*" may be used to refer to the last message in a mailbox.
(Ex. "1:*" refers to all messages)
Be careful not to use the same mailbox for source and destination, especially
if you expunge the mailbox immediately afterwards; the message will be copied
(back over itself), flagged as deleted (by the imap_mail_move function), and
then expunged.

The following code will move the messages in the $msg_no[] array from the
folder in $mbox_name to the folder in $newmbox_name: ($mbox is an
already-opened imap stream)

<?php
if ($mbox_name != $newmbox_name) {
  reset($msg_no);
  $messageset = implode (",",$msg_no);
  imap_mail_move($mbox,$messageset,$newmbox_name);
  imap_expunge($mbox);
}
?>

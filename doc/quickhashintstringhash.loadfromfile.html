QuickHashIntStringHash::loadFromFile — This factory method creates a hash from
a file

说明

public static QuickHashIntStringHash QuickHashIntStringHash::loadFromFile ( 
string $filename [, int $size = 0 [, int $options = 0 ]] )

This factory method creates a new hash from a definition file on disk. The file
format consists of a signature 'QH\0x12\0', the number of elements as a 32 bit
signed integer in system Endianness, an unsigned 32 bit integer containing the
number of element data to follow in characters. This element data contains all
the strings. After the header and the strings, the elements follow in pairs of
two unsigned 32 bit integers where the first one is the key, and the second one
the index in the element data string. An example could be:

Example #1 QuickHash IntString file format

00000000  51 48 12 00 02 00 00 00  09 00 00 00 4f 4e 45 00  |QH..........ONE.|
00000010  4e 49 4e 45 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 03 00 00  |NINE............|
00000020  00 04 00 00 00                                    |.....|
00000025

Example #2 QuickHash IntString file format

header signature ('QH'; key type: 1; value type: 2; filler: \0x00)
00000000  51 48 12 00

number of elements:
00000004  02 00 00 00

length of string values (9 characters):
00000008  09 00 00 00

string values:
0000000C  4f 4e 45 00 4e 49 4e 45  00

data string:
00000015  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  03 00 00 00 04 00 00 00

key/value 1 (key = 1, string index = 0 ("ONE")):
01 00 00 00  00 00 00 00

key/value 2 (key = 3, string index = 4 ("NINE")):
03 00 00 00  04 00 00 00

参数

filename

    The filename of the file to read the hash from.

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 4 to 4194304.

options

    The same options that the class' constructor takes; except that the size
    option is ignored. It is automatically calculated to be the same as the
    number of entries in the hash, rounded up to the nearest power of two with
    a maximum limit of 4194304.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntStringHash.

范例

Example #3 QuickHashIntStringHash::loadFromFile() example

<?php
$file = dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.string.hash";
$hash = QuickHashIntStringHash::loadFromFile(
    $file,
    QuickHashIntStringHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC
);
foreach( range( 0, 0x0f ) as $key )
{
    printf( "Key %3d (%2x) is %s\n",
        $key, $key, 
        $hash->exists( $key ) ? 'set' : 'unset'
    );
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Key   0 ( 0) is unset
Key   1 ( 1) is set
Key   2 ( 2) is set
Key   3 ( 3) is set
Key   4 ( 4) is unset
Key   5 ( 5) is set
Key   6 ( 6) is unset
Key   7 ( 7) is set
Key   8 ( 8) is unset
Key   9 ( 9) is unset
Key  10 ( a) is unset
Key  11 ( b) is set
Key  12 ( c) is unset
Key  13 ( d) is set
Key  14 ( e) is unset
Key  15 ( f) is unset

sybase_select_db — Selects a Sybase database

说明

bool sybase_select_db ( string $database_name [, resource $link_identifier ] )

sybase_select_db() sets the current active database on the server that's
associated with the specified link identifier.

Every subsequent call to sybase_query() will be made on the active database.

database_name

link_identifier

    If no link identifier is specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no

===============================================================================

Using this function is not required under Sybase, because Sybase SQL Server
users can be configured with a default database to use at connection time. You
only need this function if your SQL Server has multiple database names, and you
want to switch your queries from one database to another one on the same
SQLServer, for example if the connection user name has "master" as its default
database name and you want to process queries in your application database, or
if the username (in fact the loginname in Sybase terminology) has an
application database configured for its default database, and you want to
process some queries in the "master", "tempdb", or "sybsystemprocs" database.
When you call this function, and it returns successfully, the "username"
parameter in the sybase_connect or sybase_pconnect function calls is NOT the
user name that holds the access rights in that database. In fact, the
"username" is used by Sybase only as a loginname for the SQL Server, and it is
mapped to a database-specific username according to the contents of the
database sysusers system table that maps logins to database users. Many
databases only have a "dbo" username, whatever the loginname you configured on
the server's "master" database; in that case to the database is specified by
the default servername for the specified loginname, and the access rights are
determined by the database's map in sysusers system table which specifies with
login is associated with the "dbo" user. You may elect to configure another
user in your application database, with limited granted rights, and then add a
new server login with a specific password and this database as its default
database to use. Such a configuration will add an extra level of security for
your database, avoiding full privileges (thus forbidding alteration of the
database schema by PHP3 scripts). You may also give strict grants with
select-only access rights to the new user, so that PHP3 will only be able to
select data from the database, but won't be granted to modify the database
contents.

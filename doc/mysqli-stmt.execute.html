mysqli_stmt::execute

mysqli_stmt_execute

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

mysqli_stmt::execute -- mysqli_stmt_execute — Executes a prepared Query

说明

面向对象风格

bool mysqli_stmt::execute ( void )

过程化风格

bool mysqli_stmt_execute ( mysqli_stmt $stmt )

Executes a query that has been previously prepared using the mysqli_prepare()
function. When executed any parameter markers which exist will automatically be
replaced with the appropriate data.

If the statement is UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT, the total number of affected
rows can be determined by using the mysqli_stmt_affected_rows() function.
Likewise, if the query yields a result set the mysqli_stmt_fetch() function is
used.

    Note:

    When using mysqli_stmt_execute(), the mysqli_stmt_fetch() function must be
    used to fetch the data prior to performing any additional queries.

参数

stmt

    仅以过程化样式：由 mysqli_stmt_init() 返回的 statement 标识。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 面向对象风格

<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

$mysqli->query("CREATE TABLE myCity LIKE City");

/* Prepare an insert statement */
$query = "INSERT INTO myCity (Name, CountryCode, District) VALUES (?,?,?)";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($query);

$stmt->bind_param("sss", $val1, $val2, $val3);

$val1 = 'Stuttgart';
$val2 = 'DEU';
$val3 = 'Baden-Wuerttemberg';

/* Execute the statement */
$stmt->execute();

$val1 = 'Bordeaux';
$val2 = 'FRA';
$val3 = 'Aquitaine';

/* Execute the statement */
$stmt->execute();

/* close statement */
$stmt->close();

/* retrieve all rows from myCity */
$query = "SELECT Name, CountryCode, District FROM myCity";
if ($result = $mysqli->query($query)) {
    while ($row = $result->fetch_row()) {
        printf("%s (%s,%s)\n", $row[0], $row[1], $row[2]);
    }
    /* free result set */
    $result->close();
}

/* remove table */
$mysqli->query("DROP TABLE myCity");

/* close connection */
$mysqli->close();
?>

Example #2 过程化风格

<?php
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

mysqli_query($link, "CREATE TABLE myCity LIKE City");

/* Prepare an insert statement */
$query = "INSERT INTO myCity (Name, CountryCode, District) VALUES (?,?,?)";
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, $query);

mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "sss", $val1, $val2, $val3);

$val1 = 'Stuttgart';
$val2 = 'DEU';
$val3 = 'Baden-Wuerttemberg';

/* Execute the statement */
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

$val1 = 'Bordeaux';
$val2 = 'FRA';
$val3 = 'Aquitaine';

/* Execute the statement */
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

/* close statement */
mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);

/* retrieve all rows from myCity */
$query = "SELECT Name, CountryCode, District FROM myCity";
if ($result = mysqli_query($link, $query)) {
    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
        printf("%s (%s,%s)\n", $row[0], $row[1], $row[2]);
    }
    /* free result set */
    mysqli_free_result($result);
}

/* remove table */
mysqli_query($link, "DROP TABLE myCity");

/* close connection */
mysqli_close($link);
?>

以上例程会输出：

Stuttgart (DEU,Baden-Wuerttemberg)
Bordeaux (FRA,Aquitaine)

===============================================================================

After the stmt->execute() function is called the variable "$X" that was storing
the bind param e.g.

$stmt->bind_param("i", $X);

gets set to 0.

So don't try to use it for something else later... like me ...for $_session key
coz you'll get crazy..... like me...

p.s. $_session keys starting with nums get discarded.
===============================================================================

Just to clarify this note in the Manual regarding this function:

"Note:  When using mysqli_stmt_execute(), the mysqli_stmt_fetch()  function
must be used to fetch the data prior to performing any additional queries."

This is because this function DOES NOT store the result set on the client side
so you have to fetch everything in the result set or else you risk major
errors.

If you however use the function mysqli_stmt_store_result immediately after you
use this function, you are forcing the result set to be stored on the client
side and thus it is safe to issue extra queries before fetching all the data.

This is where you really have to make a choice regarding on your application's
priorities. If you know your result set is memory hefty, then its a good idea
not to store it on the client side so you don't run in any errors regarding
unavailable memory on the server. But this also means your not going to do a
lot of calculations on the result set or else you will prevent any other usage
of the table to which the result set came from until you fetched it all.

If your going to do a lot of calculations or your result set is not memory
hefty, its probably a good idea to store it on the client side.

Most of these problems can easily be solved if you have a lot of memory
available on your server but thats usually not the case for those on shared
hosting.

An intelligent way to counter this problem if your on a shared host is to be
smart in the way you design your queries. Try to limit the result set if you
know you will be fetching memory hefty result sets.

Test different alternatives for your application and see what works best for
you under different conditions.

Good Luck,
===============================================================================

If you select LOBs use the following order of execution or you risk mysqli
allocating more memory that actually used

1)prepare()
2)execute()
3)store_result()
4)bind_result()

If you skip 3) or exchange 3) and 4) then mysqli will allocate memory for the
maximal length of the column which is 255 for tinyblob, 64k for blob(still ok),
16MByte for MEDIUMBLOB - quite a lot and 4G for LONGBLOB (good if you have so
much memory). Queries which use this order a bit slower when there is a LOB but
this is the price of not having memory exhaustion in seconds.

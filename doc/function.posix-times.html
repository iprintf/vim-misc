posix_times — Get process times

说明

array posix_times ( void )

Gets information about the current CPU usage.

返回值

Returns a hash of strings with information about the current process CPU usage.
The indices of the hash are:

  • ticks - the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since reboot.
  • utime - user time used by the current process.
  • stime - system time used by the current process.
  • cutime - user time used by current process and children.
  • cstime - system time used by current process and children.

注释

Warning

This function isn't reliable to use, it may return negative values for high
times.

范例

Example #1 Example use of posix_times()

<?php

$times = posix_times();

print_r($times);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [ticks] => 25814410
    [utime] => 1
    [stime] => 1
    [cutime] => 0
    [cstime] => 0
)

doesnt work with freebsd. as stated above the clock ticks at different
intervals on different platforms.

for system uptime consider piping the uptime command or similar, depending on
if performance is an issue or not.
===============================================================================

If you want the output to be 'grammatically correct' then try the following
code.  It will eg print '1 minute' as opposed to '1 minutes', the same goes for
days and hours:

Put the following code somewhere in the head of the page code:

<?php
function uptime() {
if (!$times = posix_times() ) {
return ("unknown");
} else {
$now = $times['ticks'];
$days = intval($now / (60*60*24*100));
$remainder = $now % (60*60*24*100);
$hours = intval($remainder / (60*60*100));
$remainder = $remainder % (60*60*100);
$minutes = intval($remainder / (60*100));
if ($days == 1) {$writeDays = "day";} else {$writeDays = "days";}
if ($hours == 1) {$writeHours = "hour"; } else {$writeHours = "hours";}
if ($minutes == 1) {$writeMins = "minute";} else {$writeMins = "minutes";}
return ("$days $writeDays, $hours $writeHours, $minutes $writeMins");
}
}
?>

Then put this bit where you want the info displayed:

<?php
print uptime();
?>

I am not sure why, and it could just be me but on my FreeBSD system using
$time = posix_times();
$time['ticks'] is an enormous value that bears no relation to the system uptime
(I tested by rebooting the system,  the number does not change).
I checked my timecounters, they tick every 10.000msec and I did the maths on
the returned value and it suggested the machine had been up for over 200 days -
it was reformatted about a week ago.
This could be to do with FreeBSD, or *BSD, or just *idiots like me but just
check before you use the function.

This function will return the system uptime as a human readable string such as
"172 days, 18 hours, 15 minutes".  I didn't bother to handle singular so the
grammar could be a bit off, e.g. 1 hours.

function uptime() {
  if (!$times = posix_times()) {
    return ("unknown");
  } else {
    $now = $times['ticks'];
    $days = intval($now / (60*60*24*100));
    $remainder = $now % (60*60*24*100);
    $hours = intval($remainder / (60*60*100));
    $remainder = $remainder % (60*60*100);
    $minutes = intval($remainder / (60*100));
    return ("$days days, $hours hours, $minutes minutes");
  }
}

Event::add

(PECL libevent >= 0.0.1)

Event::add — Makes event pending

说明

public bool Event::add ([ double $timeout ] )

Marks event pending. Non-pending event will never occur, and the event callback
will never be called. In conjuction with Event::del() an event could be
re-scheduled by user at any time.

If Event::add() is called on an already pending event, libevent will leave it
pending and re-schedule it with the given timeout(if specified). If in this
case timeout is not specified, Event::add() has no effect.

参数

timeout

    Timeout in seconds.

返回值

Returns TRUE on success. Otherwise FALSE

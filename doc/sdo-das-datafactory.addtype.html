说明

void SDO_DAS_DataFactory::addType ( string $type_namespace_uri , string
$type_name [, array $options ] )
Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Add a new type to the SDO_DAS_DataFactory, defined by its namespace and type
name. The type becomes part of the model of data objects that the data factory
can create.

参数

type_namespace_uri

    The namespace of the type.

type_name

    The name of the type.

options

    This array holds one or more key=>value pairs to set attribute values for
    the type. The optional keywords are:

    open

        A flag to say whether the type is open. An SDO_DataObject whose type is
        open can have properties added to them which are not described by the
        type. This capability is used to support working with XML documents
        whose schema support open content such as that described by an
        <xsd:any> element. The default value is 'false'.

    sequenced

        A flag to say whether the type is sequenced. Sequenced types can have
        the ordering across properties preserved and can contain unstructured
        text. The default value is 'false'. For more information on sequenced
        types see the section on Working with Sequenced Data Objects.

    basetype

        If specified, an array of namespace URI and type name strings for the
        type from which this type is derived. An example of the use of base
        types is when a type derived in an XML schema inherits from another
        type by using <extension base="...">.

返回值

None.

范例

===============================================================================

Apparently, it doesn't really close *all* connections; just those used by the
current script.

If you are using persistent connections, every time a script does an
odbc_pconnect() and all open connections are in use you'll get a new connection
with the same credentials. You won't close them all with odbc_close_all().

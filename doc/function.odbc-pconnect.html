odbc_pconnect — Open a persistent database connection

说明

resource odbc_pconnect ( string $dsn , string $user , string $password [, int
$cursor_type ] )

Opens a persistent database connection.

This function is much like odbc_connect(), except that the connection is not
really closed when the script has finished. Future requests for a connection
with the same dsn, user, password combination (via odbc_connect() and 
odbc_pconnect()) can reuse the persistent connection.

参数

See odbc_connect() for details.

返回值

Returns an ODBC connection id or 0 (FALSE) on error.

注释

    Note: Persistent connections have no effect if PHP is used as a CGI
    program.

The following constants are defined for cursortype:
- SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED
- SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC
- SQL_CUR_USE_DRIVER
- SQL_CUR_DEFAULT

With some ODBC drivers, executing a complex stored procedure may fail with an
error similar to: "Cannot open a cursor on a stored procedure that has anything
other than a single select statement in it". Using SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC may avoid
that error. Also, some drivers don't support the optional row_number parameter
in odbc_fetch_row(). SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC might help in that case, too.

Ok, learning time.  As I was told by the PHP-DevTeam...


Multiple connections are supported, but when you try to connect with exactly
the same parameters, an existing
connection will be reused, leading to the behaviour you see.

You can simply omit the calls to odbc_close() since
connections get closed on script termination anyway or better:
Consider making your connection id a global variable or pass
it to your functions.

I saw that closing an ODBC persistent connection opened with odbc_pconnect()
with odbc_close() doesnt work. Someone here have proposed using odbc_close_all
() but wouldnt that close all persistent connections (also others ones !!!) ?
What about catching a persistent handle with odbc_connect() and then closing
the connection with odbc_close() ? If there are no available handles (for some
reason the last pconn has been closed) this approach opens and close a normal
single-script connection. Waiting comments...
===============================================================================

I found that using  odbc_close($odbchandle)  on a connection opened by
odbc_pconnect() causes a warning "not a valid ODBC-Link resource".  So you
can't just change odbc_connect() to odbc_pconnect() and expect things to work
without warning messages.  However, you can use odbc_close_all() and not get a
warning.

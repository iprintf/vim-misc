说明

bool mssql_free_statement ( resource $stmt )

mssql_free_statement() only needs to be called if you are worried about using
too much memory while your script is running. All statement memory will
automatically be freed when the script ends. You may call mssql_free_statement
() with the statement identifier as an argument and the associated statement
memory will be freed.

参数

stmt

    Statement resource, obtained with mssql_init().

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 mssql_free_statement() example

<?php
// Create a new statement
$stmt = mssql_init('test');

// Bind values here and execute the statement

// once we're done, we clear it from the memory
// using mssql_free_statement like so:
mssql_free_statement($stmt);
?>

===============================================================================

Maybe it's unique to my FreeTDS configuration, but if I don't call
mssql_free_statement() after every stored procedure (i.e. mssql_init,
mssql_bind, mssql_execute, mssql_fetch_array), all subsequent stored procedures
on the same database connection will fail.

I only mention it because this man-page deprecates the use of
mssql_free_statement(), saying it's only there for run-time memory concerns. 
At least in my case, it's also a crucial step in the process of running a
stored procedure.  If anyone else has problems running multiple stored
procedures on the same connection, I hope this helps them out.

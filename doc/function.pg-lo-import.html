(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_lo_import — 将文件导入为大型对象

说明

int pg_lo_import ([ resource $connection ], string $pathname [, mixed
$object_id ] )

pg_lo_import() creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

要使用大型对象（lo）接口，需要将其放置在事务块中。

    Note: 当启用安全模式时， PHP 会检查被操作的文件或目录是否与被执行的脚本有相
    同的 UID（所有者）。

    Note:

    本函数以前的名字为 pg_loimport()。

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When connection is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by pg_connect() or pg_pconnect().

pathname

    变量指明了要导入为大型对象的文件名。

object_id

    If an object_id is given the function will try to create a large object
    with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The
    parameter was added in PHP 5.3 and relies on functionality that first
    appeared in PostgreSQL 8.1.

返回值

导入成功则返回新建的大型对象的 OID，如果出错则返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                               说明
5.3.0 The optional object_id was added.

4.2.0 在 PHP 4.2.0 版本之前，本函数语法不一样，见如下定义：
      int pg_lo_import ( string $pathname [, resource $connection ] )

范例

Example #1 pg_lo_import() 例子

   $database = pg_connect("dbname=jacarta");
   pg_query($database, "begin");
   $oid = pg_lo_import($database, '/tmp/lob.dat');
   pg_query($database, "commit");
?>

===============================================================================

its not very clear if pg_lo_import needs to have pg_lo_open called first.
Because pg_lo_import handles the process of writign to the file, it seems
logical that pg_lo_open does not need to be called. However due to the ugly
nature of how postgres handles oid objects, it would be nice to have this
documented.
===============================================================================

Due to a bug, OLD API does not available with PHP 4.2.0 and 4.2.1.

PHP 4.2.2 will support OLD API again and will be kept long enough.

New API will be available PHP 4.2.0 to later versions.
===============================================================================

Due to a bug, PHP 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 does not support pg_lo_import() old API. It's
fixed in PHP 4.2.2.

BTW, new API will be always available from PHP 4.2.0 to later versions. Older
API will be kept long enough, also.
===============================================================================

it works for me (php-4.2.1)

not like this

int pg_lo_import ( string pathname [, resource connection])

but
int pg_lo_import ( resource connection, string pathname )

don't know the reason

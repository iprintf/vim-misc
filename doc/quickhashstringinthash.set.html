QuickHashStringIntHash::set — This method updates an entry in the hash with a
new value, or adds a new one if the entry doesn't exist

说明

public int QuickHashStringIntHash::set ( string $key , int $value )

This method tries to update an entry with a new value. In case the entry did
not yet exist, it will instead add a new entry. It returns whether the entry
was added or update. If there are duplicate keys, only the first found element
will get an updated value. Use QuickHashStringIntHash::CHECK_FOR_DUPES during
hash creation to prevent duplicate keys from being part of the hash.

参数

key

    The key of the entry to add or update.

value

    The value of the entry to add. If a non-string is passed, it will be
    converted to a string automatically if possible.

返回值

2 if the entry was found and updated, 1 if the entry was newly added or 0 if
there was an error.

范例

Example #1 QuickHashStringIntHash::set() example

<?php
$hash = new QuickHashStringIntHash( 1024 );

echo "Set->Add\n";
var_dump( $hash->get( "fourty six thousand six hundred ninety two" ) );
var_dump( $hash->set( "fourty six thousand six hundred ninety two", 16091 ) );
var_dump( $hash->get( "fourty six thousand six hundred ninety two" ) );

echo "Set->Update\n";
var_dump( $hash->set( "fourty six thousand six hundred ninety two", 29906 ) );
var_dump( $hash->get( "fourty six thousand six hundred ninety two" ) );
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Set->Add
bool(false)
int(2)
int(16091)
Set->Update
int(1)
int(29906)

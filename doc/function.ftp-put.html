ftp_put() overwrites existing files.
Again: trivial but not mentioned here.
===============================================================================

If when using ftp_put you get the one of the following errors:

Warning: ftp_put() [function.ftp-put]: Opening ASCII mode data connection

Warning: ftp_put() [function.ftp-put]: Opening BINARY mode data connection

and it creates the file in the correct location but is a 0kb file and all FTP
commands thereafter fail. It is likely that the client is behind a firewall. To
rectify this use:

<?php
ftp_pasv($resource, true);
?>

Before executing any put commands. Took me so long to figure this out I
actually cheered when I did :D
===============================================================================

If you want to copy a whole directory tree (with subdiretories),
this function (ftp_copy) might be usefull. Tested with
php 4.2.2 and a Linux OS.

Example:
----------------------------------------------------------------
$conn_id = ftp_connect("server_adress");
...

$src_dir = "/from";
$dst_dir = "/to";

ftp_copy($src_dir, $dst_dir);
...
ftp_close($conn_id)

Function: ftp_copy()
----------------------------------------------------------------
function ftp_copy($src_dir, $dst_dir) {

global $conn_id;

$d = dir($src_dir);

    while($file = $d->read()) {

        if ($file != "." && $file != "..") {

            if (is_dir($src_dir."/".$file)) {

                if (!@ftp_chdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file)) {

                ftp_mkdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file);
                }

            ftp_copy($src_dir."/".$file, $dst_dir."/".$file);
            }
            else {

            $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file, $src_dir."/".$file,
FTP_BINARY);
            }
        }
    }

$d->close();
}

Hi !

If you get this error when trying to send data to server :
Warning: ftp_put() [function.ftp-put]: Unable to build data connection:
Connection timed out...

Two solutions :
- Add the program httpd.exe in your exception list for external connexions of
your firewall. Indeed, the FTP protocol open a new socket for data transfer.
And this socket is opened from the server to the client (your computer). This
program is located (for WAMP) in C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache[version]\bin\
- Use the ftp_pasv() function to activate the passive mode. In this mode, it is
the client who open the new socket to the server.
===============================================================================

I had a little trouble getting the ftp_put to work, because of that particular
server.  All variables and data parsed from the previous web form had to be
retreived using $_POST, $_GET or $_FILES.

If you don't know what you sent use phpinfo(); to display what the server
thinks about your data.

so...when sending files using a form and PHP, make sure that all the data (text
files etc...) are retreived with $_POST, and files (smiley.png,
compression.zip, etc...) are retreived with $_FILES.

here's what your start of a results.php file might look like:
<?PHP
   $myName = $_POST['name']; //This will copy the text into a variable
   $myFile = $_FILES['file_name']; // This will make an array out of the file
information that was stored.
?>

Now when it comes to transmitting that information...

<?PHP
        $destination_path = "src/bin/";

//where you want to throw the file on the webserver (relative to your login
dir)

    $destination_file = $destination_path."img.jpg";

//This will create a full path with the file on the end for you to  use, I like
splitting the variables like this in case I need to use on on their own or if
I'm dynamically creating new folders.

        $file = $myFile['tmp_name'];

//Converts the array into a new string containing the path name on the server
where your file is.

    $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $destination_file, $file, FTP_BINARY);// upload
the file
    if (!$upload) {// check upload status
        echo "FTP upload of $destination_file has failed!";
    } else {
        echo "Uploaded $file to $conn_id as $destination_file";
    }
?>

hope this is usefull ^_^
===============================================================================

If you are having timeouts uploading a file, even very small files, you might
have a look at ftp_pasv()

And don't forget to do it after your ftp_login();

Got this cryptic error

Warning:  ftp_put() [function.ftp-put]: 'STOR' not understood in
C:\wamp\www\kevtest\ftp_todays.php on line 48

Found the prob, you can't put a path to the destination file
(even though I can do that in the dos ftp client...?)

e.g. - this doesn't work
ftp_put($conn, '/www/site/file.html','c:/wamp/www/site/file.html',FTP_BINARY);

you have to put

<?php
ftp_chdir($conn, '/www/site/');
ftp_put($conn,'file.html', 'c:/wamp/www/site/file.html', FTP_BINARY );
?>
===============================================================================

The following is a fully tested function (based on a previous note) that
recursively puts files from a source directory to a destination directory. See
http://rufy.com/tech/archives/000026.html for more information.

NOTE: use full path name for the destination directory and the destination
directory must already exist

function ftp_putAll($conn_id, $src_dir, $dst_dir) {
    $d = dir($src_dir);
    while($file = $d->read()) { // do this for each file in the directory
        if ($file != "." && $file != "..") { // to prevent an infinite loop
            if (is_dir($src_dir."/".$file)) { // do the following if it is a
directory
                if (!@ftp_chdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file)) {
                    ftp_mkdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file); // create
directories that do not yet exist
                }
                ftp_putAll($conn_id, $src_dir."/".$file, $dst_dir."/".$file); /
/ recursive part
            } else {
                $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file, $src_dir."/
".$file, FTP_BINARY); // put the files
            }
        }
    }
    $d->close();
}

I was trying to upload WAV files using FTP_ASCII and the file was full of noise
after uploading.

So for WAV files use FTP_BINARY.

Hope it helps.
===============================================================================

Here is the Code I am using for the same function with more flexibility in
static code:
<?
$name = "FILE NAME";
$filename = "FILE NAME WITH FULL PATH";

//-- Code to Transfer File on Server Dt: 06-03-2008 by Aditya Bhatt --//
//-- Connection Settings
$ftp_server = "IP ADDRESS"; // Address of FTP server.
$ftp_user_name = " SERVER USERNAME"; // Username
$ftp_user_pass = " SERVER PASSWORD"; // Password
$destination_file = " SERVER FILE PATH TO UPLOAD VIA FTP_PUT"; //where you want
to throw the file on the webserver (relative to your login dir)

$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server) or die("<span style='color:#FF0000'><h2>
Couldn't connect to $ftp_server</h2></span>");        // set up basic
connection

$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass) or die("
<span style='color:#FF0000'><h2>You do not have access to this ftp server!</h2>
</span>");   // login with username and password, or give invalid user message

if ((!$conn_id) || (!$login_result)) {  // check connection
    // wont ever hit this, b/c of the die call on ftp_login
    echo "<span style='color:#FF0000'><h2>FTP connection has failed! <br />";
    echo "Attempted to connect to $ftp_server for user $ftp_user_name</h2></
span>";
    exit;
} else {
    //echo "Connected to $ftp_server, for user $ftp_user_name <br />";
}

$upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $destination_file.$name, $filename, FTP_BINARY);  /
/ upload the file
if (!$upload) {  // check upload status
    echo "<span style='color:#FF0000'><h2>FTP upload of $filename has failed!</
h2></span> <br />";
} else {
    echo "<span style='color:#339900'><h2>Uploading $name Completed
Successfully!</h2></span><br /><br />";
}
ftp_close($conn_id); // close the FTP stream   
?>

I [had an error for which] ftp_pasv didnt solve the problem. Here's why:

FTP uses 2 connections on different ports, one for connection/handshake and
another for data transfer.
The problem was that the ftp-server (that php was connecting to) also used
different IP-addresses for the different connections (say what!?).
Normally the firewall (csf) detects ftp-connections and allows them through but
because of the different IP-adresses this didn't work.

Solution:
1 angry mail to the ftp server owner.
Allowing the second IP in the firewall.

Hi,

I try to upload one text file represente CSV with tab separator thru FTP
connection.

i'm using :
ftp_put($connect_id, $fileFullName, $localFile, FTP_ASCII);

everything goes fine, but txt file in destination server get white line between
dataline...

i try :
ftp_put($connect_id, $fileFullName, $localFile, FTP_BINARY);
and everything goes fine.

so, lets do it in binary mode.
===============================================================================

This is an extremely trivial thing but one that had me stumped forever (well,
until I decided to check the error logs and see the error). I had a large file
(mysql backup of a huge forum) that was only partially being uploaded to a
remote backup server. Couldn't figure out why, until I realized that the max
execution time was being hit since it was taking longer than 30 seconds to
upload this file.

<?php
set_time_limit(0);
rest of the code here....
?>

That did the trick. It's one of those dumb, trivial things, and if you're
having trouble like I, it may be something you overlooked.
===============================================================================

When using versions of PHP below 4.04b4, the ftp_put command doesn't work on NT
/IIS4. Most of the other functions will work, but there was a bug while trying
to send upstream data to an IIS webserver.
===============================================================================

In case you aren't aware...  Some web hosting services do NOT allow outbound
ftp unless you have a dedicated server account.  A "shared" hosting account
often doesn't have this capability.   

So if you can't get your ftp, curl, or ssh remote file transfer functions to
work, check with the host service and ask.  You may have to upgrade your
account.
===============================================================================

I've seen two notes about a "ftp_copy" function but i think   there's a
misinterpretation about what an "ftp_copy" function should do. For me , it
should be something like an ftp_rename that would keep the orginal file and
clone it somewhere else on the same ftp server, as for them they consider its
purpose is to copy a local file to a distant ftp ..well .. as in FTP protocol
there's no such thing as an FTP COPY  command anyway, i think you're free to
interpret it as you want.
So here's my solution using ftp_put and ftp_get ..

<?php
// bool ftp_copy  ( resource $ftp_stream  , string $initialpath, string
$newpath, string $imagename )
function ftp_copy($conn_distant , $pathftp , $pathftpimg ,$img){
        // on recupere l'image puis on la repose dans le nouveau folder
        if(ftp_get($conn_distant, TEMPFOLDER.$img, $pathftp.'/'.$img ,
FTP_BINARY)){
                if(ftp_put($conn_distant, $pathftpimg.'/'.$img ,TEMPFOLDER.$img
, FTP_BINARY)){
                        unlink(TEMPFOLDER.$img) ;                             
               
                } else{                               
                        return false;
                }
                 
        }else{
                return false ;
        }
        return true ;
}
?>
===============================================================================

ftp_put() can display confusing warning messages as it returns one line of the
remote server's response which may be multi lined.

If you're transferring large amounts of files note that some file systems only
support up to 2000 files per directory. This had me stumped for a while.
===============================================================================

Currently, there is no function that lets you specifiy the file's contents as a
string. However, there is ftp_fput(), which operates on an open file. Using
this function in conjunction with tmpfile() lets you emulate this kind of
function. (You could also use php://memory, but this breaks BC).

<?php
function ftp_fputs($ftp_stream, $remote_file, $contents, $mode, $startpos = 0)
{
    $tmp = tmpfile();
    fwrite($tmp, $contents);
    rewind($tmp);
    $result = ftp_fput($ftp_stream, $remote_file, $tmp, $mode, $startpos);
    fclose($tmp);
    return $result;
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you are moving files from one folder to another inside the same server, the
"local file" field has to be indicated in a relative path according to the
location of the script running the ftp_put() function.

For example, your function is running on: /public_html/do_ftp.php and you want
to move /public_html/products.php to /public_html/backup/products.php

The correct way to build the function would be:

ftp_put($ftp_id, '/public_html/backup/products.php', 'products.php',
FTP_ASCII);

After having headaches for 2 days trying to make this function work using
absolute paths in both fields, I finally found the right way to use it. I hope
it helps someone. Excuse my english, it isn't my native language.
===============================================================================

I'm copying fairly large backup files from server to server. ftp_put was
running fine for awhile until it occasionally began reporting errors.
When I set TRUE as the value for the ftp_pasv () (after login), ftp_put started
working again.
===============================================================================

if you examine the first user submitted function, ftp_putAll, it will work only
if you extract this line and its matching bracket.

if (!@ftp_chdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file))

The function will have changed into that directory before having uploaded files
to it.  This alters your upload path and the system will try to upload into an
essentially non-existent directory (duped at the end).

Hope this helps some of you.
Cheers.

Here is a fix for the function from lucas at rufy dot com below that will
recursively put files from a source directory to a destination directory.  As
written below, it won't put a file in a directory that already exists, because
the the destination is altered.  So here is the corrected function that will
allow it to work:

function ftp_putAll($conn_id, $src_dir, $dst_dir) {
   $d = dir($src_dir);
   while($file = $d->read()) { // do this for each file in the directory
       if ($file != "." && $file != "..") { // to prevent an infinite loop
           if (is_dir($src_dir."/".$file)) { // do the following if it is a
directory
               if (!@ftp_nlist($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file)) {
                   ftp_mkdir($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file); // create
directories that do not yet exist
               }
               ftp_putAll($conn_id, $src_dir."/".$file, $dst_dir."/".$file); //
recursive part
           } else {
               $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $dst_dir."/".$file, $src_dir."/
".$file, FTP_BINARY); // put the files
           }
       }
   }
   $d->close();
}

victor at nobel dot com dot br wrote that
the correct dirpath format excluded "/home/USER/" from the public path, but for
my server, i had to use it in order to get my scripts to work.

it may be obvious to most but I'm positing that you cannot use the $_SERVER
['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] path since FTP starts at your top-level and therefore
bypasses (or just plain doesn't recognize) most of the virtual server pathing.
===============================================================================

I spent some time debugging a silly problem:

In php >= 5, ftp_put() will apparently rewind to the start of the file
regardless of the state you left it in before sending it to the $host.

I found this out because I wasn't closing the file handle before using ftp_put
(). Since I had just written to the file, the file pointer must have been
located at the *bottom*.

I was sending a 0-byte file on php 4.2.2., but worked fine on php 5.

So, just a heads up, don't forget to close those filehandles. Even though I was
using the filename as the argument for ftp_put, it still needs to be closed.

I did not call rewind on the file handle, just fclose($file_h).
===============================================================================

This solution to a common problem is implied elsewhere, but I thought it might
be useful to put it all in one place (since I spent hours piecing it together!)

Sometimes a web host will open PHP sessions with a user of 'nobody'. Files
created by this user may not have the correct permissions to allow  management
of those files by the actual owner of the site.  The following script allows
the actual owner to open access to a directory so that 'nobody' can create a
file using fopen(). Then using the handle created by 'nobody', the ftp_fput()
command saves the file with the correct owner.  The file 'nobody' created is
discarded.
<?
    $connection = ftp_connect($ftpServer);
    ftp_login($connection, $ftpUser, $ftpPass);
    ftp_chdir($connection, $ftpDir);
    // open the directory so that 'nobody' can create a temporary file   
    ftp_site($cn, "CHMOD 777 $ftpDir");
    $new="tempFile";
    @unlink($new); // just in case
    $handle=fopen($new,"x");
    chmod($new,0777);
    fputs($handle,"a bunch of stuff...");
    fclose($handle); // have to rewind
    $handle=fopen("tempFile","r");
    ftp_fput($connection, "finalFile", $handle, FTP_ASCII);
    fclose($handle);
    unlink($new);
    // remove open access to the directory
    ftp_site($connection, "CHMOD 755 $ftpDir")
    ftp_close($connection);
?>
===============================================================================

Took me forever to work out but this will work if you get the paths right!

<?php
function ftp_copy($file) {
global $conn_id;
$ftp_root = '/public_html/';
$site_root = '/home/usr/public_html/';
return ftp_put($conn_id, $ftp_root . $file, $site_root . $file, FTP_BINARY);
}
?>

Login to your site using an FTP client to retrieve the $ftp_root

Use something like getcwd() to get the $site root
===============================================================================

If you are getting the very helpful warnings...
"Opening BINARY mode data connection" or
"Opening ASCII mode data connection"

... and have tried ftp_pasv, ftp_alloc, switching between FTP_ASCII or
FTP_BINARY and blaming the FTP provider (like I did), try using ftp_close then
ftp_connect to reset your FTP connection. Worked for me!
===============================================================================

Hi,

I try to upload one text file represente CSV with tab separator thru FTP
connection.

i'm using :
ftp_put($connect_id, $fileFullName, $localFile, FTP_ASCII);

everything goes fine, but txt file in destination server get white line between
dataline...

i try :
ftp_put($connect_id, $fileFullName, $localFile, FTP_BINARY);
and everything goes fine.

so, lets do it in binary mode.

Friends,
If you wanna upload files from your harddisk by a form to a specified ftp this
sample can help you...
First of all create the form:
<html>

<body marginwidth=4 marginheight=4 topmargin=4 leftmargin=4 bgcolor=white vlink
="#0000ff" link="#0000ff">

<form name="Attachments"  method=POST action="sendimage.php" enctype="multipart
/form-data">

<input type=hidden name=box value="">

<tr>
<td nowrap width="1%">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Image:</b></td>
<td colspan=2>
<input type=file name=source_file size=20> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</td>
</tr>
<input type=submit name=btnSubmit value=Submit size=20 style="border: 1px solid
#0000FF"></form>
</body>
</html>

The critical point in this form is the usage of  enctype="multipart/form-data"
If you don't use this part your upload operations won't work.
Then u must create sendimage.php as follows:

<?php
       
    $ftp_server='190.148.20.201';//serverip
    $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);
   
  
    // login with username and password
    $user="username";
    $passwd="*****";
    $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $user, $passwd);

// check connection
   if ((!$conn_id) || (!$login_result)) {
        echo "FTP connection has failed!";
        echo "Attempted to connect to $ftp_server for user $ftp_user_name";
        die;
    } else {
        echo "<br>Connected to $ftp_server, for user $user<br>";
    }
//directorylike /www.velibaba.com/images
  ftp_chdir($conn_id, "www.velibab.com");
  ftp_chdir($conn_id, "compimages");

//$destination_file=ftp_pwd($conn_id);

$destination_file="x.jpg";
echo ("<br>");
print $destination_file;

echo ("<br>");

// upload the file
$upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $destination_file, $source_file, FTP_BINARY);

// check upload status
if (!$upload) {
        echo "FTP upload has failed!";
    } else {
        echo "Uploaded $source_file to $ftp_server as $destination_file";

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_lo_write — 向大型对象写入数据

说明

int pg_lo_write ( resource $large_object , string $data )

pg_lo_write() 把 data 参数中的数据尽可能多地写入大型对象并返回实际写入的字节数
。如果出错则返回 FALSE。large_object 参数是 pg_lo_open() 函数所返回的大型对象资
源号。

要使用大型对象（lo）接口，需要将其放置在事务块中。

    Note:

    本函数以前的名字为 pg_lo_write()。

参见 pg_lo_create() 和 pg_lo_open()。

===============================================================================

Be aware when you modify a lo with pg_lowrite() to remove first the old one :
if the new lo is smaller than the one before, it only overwrite the begining
and you keep the end of the old lo (open with "w" parameter, PHP 4.04 Linux
RH).
===============================================================================

Using php 4.3.0 and PostgreSQL 7.3.1

I can write a simple script in which pg_lo_write seems to always return 1 and
not the number of bytes written, as evidenced by extracting the data through
another means.

Further more, I can make this pg_lo_write fail, or at least fail to write all
the data it's pretty difficult to tell without the number of bytes written
being returned, and not return the false value. In addition to this, the lo
resource has been adjusted so that the oid it contains is 0.

Unfortunately, I do not know what exactly the failure mode is, it does seem to
be in the ip network communication side of PostgreSQL, which is odd since the
unix domain comms works fine for this. However, it would have been useful to
have the pg_lo_write() function return as advertised, it would have saved some
of the 2 man hours me and the dev. team put into diagnosing this problem.

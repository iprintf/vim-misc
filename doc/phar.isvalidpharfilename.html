(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 1.2.0)

Phar::isValidPharFilename — Returns whether the given filename is a valid phar
filename

说明

final public static bool Phar::isValidPharFilename ( string $filename [, bool
$executable = true ] )

Returns whether the given filename is a valid phar filename that will be
recognized as a phar archive by the phar extension. This can be used to test a
name without having to instantiate a phar archive and catch the inevitable
Exception that will be thrown if an invalid name is specified.

参数

filename

    The name or full path to a phar archive not yet created

executable

    This parameter determines whether the filename should be treated as a phar
    executable archive, or a data non-executable archive

返回值

Returns TRUE if the filename is valid, FALSE if not.


User Contributed Notes 1 note

===============================================================================

Note, that this method accepts _everything_ (=> returns 'true'), when
$executable is 'false' as long as the filename contains at least a dot

var_dump(\PharData::isValidPharFilename('randomstring.y', false));
bool(true)

This is not wrong at all, because I can name an archive like I want, but it
makes the method completely useless (when $executable == false).

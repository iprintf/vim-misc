(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

msql_pconnect — Open persistent mSQL connection

说明

resource msql_pconnect ([ string $hostname ] )

msql_pconnect() acts very much like msql_connect() with two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host. If one is found, an identifier for
it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (
msql_close() will not close links established by this function).

参数

hostname

    The hostname can also include a port number. e.g. hostname,port.

    If not specified, the connection is established by the means of a Unix
    domain socket, being more efficient than a localhost TCP socket connection.

        Note: While this function will accept a colon (:) as a host/port
        separator, a comma (,) is the preferred method.

返回值

Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

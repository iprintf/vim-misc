===============================================================================

If you have multiple displays set up, this function will only grab the primary
display; not all of them like you would with the 'Print Screen' key.

Also, this should be pretty obvious but I'll mention it anyway, if you're
running GPU-intensive applications (not CPU), calling this function will cause
quite some significant lag to your machine and server response until the
request is complete.
===============================================================================

For this to work your Apache service must be set to 'Allow service to interact
with desktop' otherwise you will just get a blank image. To fix this
right-click My Computer, select Manage/Services and Applications/Services -
find the apache service (like Apache2) and right-click, select Properties -
choose the Log on tab and check the 'Allow service to interact with desktop'
checkbox. Restart Apache.

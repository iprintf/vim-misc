fann_create_shortcut — Creates a standard backpropagation neural network which
is not fully connectected and has shortcut connections

说明

reference fann_create_shortcut ( int $num_layers , int $num_neurons1 , int
$num_neurons2 [, int $... ] )

Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which is not fully connected
and which also has shortcut connections.

Shortcut connections are connections that skip layers. A fully connected
network with shortcut connections, is a network where all neurons are connected
to all neurons in later layers. Including direct connections from the input
layer to the output layer.

参数

num_layers

    The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

num_neurons1

    Number of neurons in the first layer.

num_neurons2

    Number of neurons in the second layer.

...

    Number of neurons in other layers.

返回值

Returns a neural network resource on success, or FALSE on error.

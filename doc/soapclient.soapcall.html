SoapClient::__soapCall

(PHP 5 >= 5.0.1, PHP 7)

SoapClient::__soapCall — Calls a SOAP function

说明

public mixed SoapClient::__soapCall ( string $function_name , array $arguments
[, array $options [, mixed $input_headers [, array &$output_headers ]]] )

This is a low level API function that is used to make a SOAP call. Usually, in
WSDL mode, SOAP functions can be called as methods of the SoapClient object.
This method is useful in non-WSDL mode when soapaction is unknown, uri differs
from the default or when sending and/or receiving SOAP Headers.

On error, a call to a SOAP function can cause PHP to throw exceptions or return
a SoapFault object if exceptions are disabled. To check if the function call
failed to catch the SoapFault exceptions, check the result with is_soap_fault()
.

参数

function_name

    The name of the SOAP function to call.

arguments

    An array of the arguments to pass to the function. This can be either an
    ordered or an associative array. Note that most SOAP servers require
    parameter names to be provided, in which case this must be an associative
    array.

options

    An associative array of options to pass to the client.

    The location option is the URL of the remote Web service.

    The uri option is the target namespace of the SOAP service.

    The soapaction option is the action to call.

input_headers

    An array of headers to be sent along with the SOAP request.

output_headers

    If supplied, this array will be filled with the headers from the SOAP
    response.

返回值

SOAP functions may return one, or multiple values. If only one value is
returned by the SOAP function, the return value of __soapCall will be a simple
value (e.g. an integer, a string, etc). If multiple values are returned,
__soapCall will return an associative array of named output parameters.

On error, if the SoapClient object was constructed with the exceptions option
set to FALSE, a SoapFault object will be returned.

===============================================================================

Note that calling __soapCall and calling the generated method from WSDL
requires specifying parameters in two different ways.

For example, if you have a web service with method login that takes username
and password, you can call it the following way:
<?php
$params = array('username'=>'name', 'password'=>'secret');
$client->login($params);
?>

If you want to call __soapCall, you must wrap the arguments in another array as
follows:
<?php
$client->__soapCall('login', array($params));
?>
===============================================================================

Following OrionI's example:

<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://server/sumservice.asmx?WSDL");
$params->a = 2;
$params->b = 3;
$objectresult = $client->Sum($params);
$simpleresult = $objectresult->SumResult;
print($simpleresult); //produces "-1"
?>

Please note that the lines:

"$client->Sum($params);"

and

"$simpleresult = $objectresult->SumResult;"

are based off of each other. If your web service function is called "Sum", then
add "Result" to the end of it to get the results of the call.

EG:

<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://server/mathservice.asmx?WSDL");
$params->a = 2;
$params->b = 3;
$objectresult = $client->Minus($params); // note the name of the function is
"Minus"
$simpleresult = $objectresult->MinusResult; // note the name of the result is
referenced as "MinusResult"
print($simpleresult); //produces "5"
?>
===============================================================================

One thing to note.

This happened to me and it took a while until I discovered what the problem
was.

I was trying to get .NET objects from a provided web service, however it always
seemed to return empty objects. It did return the backbone, but nothing within
the objects that made up the structure.

Anyhow, it seems that you have to be very precise with the arrays when calling
these functions. Par example, do this:

<?php
$obj = $client->__soapCall($SOAPCall, array('parameters'=>$SoapCallParameters
));
?>

meaning that you must put an array as the second argument with 'parameters' as
the key and the soap call parameters as the value.

Also make sure that the parameter variable, in my case $SoapCallParameters is
in the form of what is requested by the webservice.

So, don't just make an array of the form:
<?php

(
   [0] => 'Mary',
   [1] => 1983
)

?>

but if the webservice requests a 'muid' variable as 'Mary' and a 'birthyear' as
1983, then make your array like this:

<?php

(
   [muid] => 'Mary',
   [birthyear] => 1983
)

?>

The above arrays refer to the $SoapCallParameters variable.

Hope this helps somebody, not having to spend too much time figuring out the
problems.
===============================================================================

I am using SOAP call response headers to sign request results.

After alot of hours, I finally got the best way to get SOAP response headers
(other than parsing __getLastResponse() witch requires trace option enabled) is
using __soapCall() wrapper.

You can extend SoapClient class and wrap some functions to make sure you get
the headers.

<?php

class API extends SoapClient
{

    // ... Constructor, etc.

    // Get SOAP Server response headers
    public function __soapCall($function, $arguments, $options = array(), 
$input_headers = null, &$output_headers = null)
    {
        parent::__soapCall($function, $arguments, $options, $input_headers, 
$output_headers);

        print_r($output_headers); // Array of response headers
    }

    // If you are using WSDL you need this, so you still can call functions
directly without calling __soapCall manualy
    public function __call($func, $args)
    {
        return $this->__soapCall($func, $args);
    }

?>
===============================================================================

The call to __soapCall returned an object to me either. This is the function
which makes my life easier:

function obj2array($obj) {
  $out = array();
  foreach ($obj as $key => $val) {
    switch(true) {
        case is_object($val):
         $out[$key] = obj2array($val);
         break;
      case is_array($val):
         $out[$key] = obj2array($val);
         break;
      default:
        $out[$key] = $val;
    }
  }
  return $out;
}

Usage:
...
$response = $client ->__soapCall("track", array('parameters' => $request));
$response = obj2array($response);

Hope it helps.
===============================================================================

When calling over SOAP to a .NET application, you may end up with an object as
a result instead of a simple type, even if you're just grabbing a simple type
(like a boolean result). Use a property accessor to get the actual result, like
this:
<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://server/myservice.asmx?WSDL");
$objectresult = $client->MyMethod($param1, $param2);
$simpleresult = $objectresult->MyMethodResult;
?>
Note that .NET seems to name the result MethodNameResult for method MethodName.
===============================================================================

One little gotcha when passing the parameters where you need to have attributes
and a simpletype value:

To get the xml

<foo bar="moo">cheese</foo>

You'd pass in:

<?php
array("foo" => array("_" => "cheese", "bar"=>"moo"));
?>

See that "_" bit? It really wasn't obvious from the documentation.
===============================================================================

If your service is a .NET doc/lit, which means the input message has a single
part named 'parameters' that is a structure that wraps the parameters.  Your
call should look like this:

<?php

$params = array('param_name_1'=>$val_1,'param_name_2'=>$val_2);
$client->call('MethodName', array('parameters' => $params));

?>
===============================================================================

To avoid the SOAP client returning sometimes objects and sometimes arrays of
objects, there's a setting:

   $this->soapClient = new \SoapClient($wsdlUrl, array(
    'features' => SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS,
    'trace' => DEBUG_SOAP
   ));
===============================================================================

I was working with SOAP for the first time and I had to create a client that
sent a date range to a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to return some
information I needed.  I didn't know how to pass the params and there really
was no documentation about it.  The main thing you have to make sure to do is
when you pass params to a method that is definied by the WSDL that you are
calling is that you use the same param name for the key of the array or the
object variable as shown below.  Also, if you don't know what the methods/
functions that a WSDL has or the params that you need to pass it you can use
the __getFunctions() and __getTypes() methods after you declare your new
SoapClient.

<?php
// From and to are the two params that the execute function needs
// when called from the WSDL so make you to have them as the
// key to an array like below
$params["From"] = "06/01/2005"; // also can use $params->From = "date";
$params["to"] = "12/31/2005"; // also can use $params->to = "date";

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl");

try {
        print($client->execute($params));
} catch (SoapFault $exception) {
        echo $exception;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Correction on the previously submitted code snippet...the incoming parameter
for .NET also has to be in object or array form for it to be correctly
converted to the XML form that .NET expects (as already mentioned by Llu?s P?
mies). The full example (when using WSDL) should be like this:
<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://server/myservice.asmx?WSDL");
$params->param1 = $value1;
$params->param2 = $value2;
$objectresult = $client->MyMethod($params);
$simpleresult = $objectresult->MyMethodResult;
?>
So if you have a C# function like this:
//sumservice.asmx
...
[WebMethod]
public int Sum(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}
...
The PHP client would be this:
<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://server/sumservice.asmx?WSDL");
$params->a = 2;
$params->b = 3;
$objectresult = $client->Sum($params);
$simpleresult = $objectresult->SumResult;
print($simpleresult); //produces "5"
?>
===============================================================================

The options in the third argument is documented in http://php.net/manual/en/
function.soap-soapclient-construct.php
===============================================================================

If you are using this method, remember that the array of arguments need to be
passed in with the ordering being the same order that the SOAP endpoint
expects.

e.g
<?php
//server expects: Foo(string name, int age)

//won't work
$args = array(32, 'john');
$out = $client->__soapCall('Foo', $args);

//will work
$args = array('john', 32);
$out = $client->__soapCall('Foo', $args);
?>

I get the same problem reported above by ryan:
"ryan at grunt dot tv

If you want to pass an xml document node as a function parameter, your need to
create a SoapVar object with a text represention of the xml node and the
XSD_ANYXML encoding constant. However, this constant is not exported by the
extension and is not documented for some unknown reason."

When defined variable soapVar I assigned the type XSD_STRING rather than as
XSD_ANYXML.
And when calls to the function you must pass the soapVar in an associative
array.

For example if the function (called myFunc) expect a parameter called xmlInput
you should do something like this:
$soapvar = new SoapVar($query, XSD_STRING);
$result = $client->myFunc(array('xmlInput'=>$soapvar));

This XML fragment are wrapped around xmlImput tags.-
===============================================================================

If you want to pass an xml document node as a function parameter, your need to
create a SoapVar object with a text represention of the xml node and the
XSD_ANYXML encoding constant. However, this constant is not exported by the
extension and is not documented for some unknown reason.

Therefore, to get this to work you must either register the XSD_ANYXML #define
as a PHP constant, or use the integer value of the constant when creating the
SoapVar, which is 147.

$soapvar = new SoapVar($xml_text, 147);

$params = array("ItemXml" => $soapvar, "PropertyView" => "blah");
$result = $this->soapclient->__soapCall("SaveItem", array("parameters"=>
$params), null, $this->soapheaders);

However, this still doesnt give the correct result. For some reason, the
ItemXml parameter node is not wrapped around the associated xml parameter in
the soap request, and the following soap is produced (assumming '<item>blah</
item>' is used as the $xml_text):

<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="..." xmlns:ns1="...">
<SOAP-ENV:Header>...</SOAP-ENV:Header>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<ns1:SaveItem>
<item>blah</item>
<ns1:PropertyView>blah</ns1:PropertyView>
</ns1:SaveItem>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
===============================================================================

The most annoying thing is that you'll get no warning trying to pass object not
matching wsdl e.g. if server expects smth like $Object->expName->... and you
would pass $Object->otherName the client will send empty request without
notifying you.
Also pay attention that names are key sensitive.

In my case I spent hours trying to pass $Post->Lead->... object instead of
$Post->lead-> ...
===============================================================================

Note, when trying to overload the __soapCall function, you should not use type
hints or STRICT_STANDARDS will complain.
The correct signature is as follows:

<?php
class MySoapClient extends \SoapClient
{
    ...
    public function __soapCall($function_name, $arguments, $options = null, 
$input_headers = null, &$output_headers = null)
     {
        ...
    }
    ....
}
?>

I was integrating a local warehouse system with a SOAP to our system and
noticed some things.

1) Service uses "dot-namespacing" (fe. Item.Price) I classmapped this to
Item_Price and used magical __get() and __set() to strip off 'Item.' from
variable names. Works like a charm.

Example:
<Item.Price>1.52</Item.Price>

<?php
class Item_Price {
    public $price;
    public function __get($field) { $field = str_replace('Item.', '', $field);
return $this->$field; }
    public function __set($field, $value) { $field = str_replace('Item.', '', 
$field); $this->$field = $value; }
?>

2) I noticed that classmapping a segment with attributes and value is possible.
Class uses variables as attributes and $_ is the value.

Example:
<?php
class Foo {
    public $item = 'Bar';
    public $_ = 'Value here';
}
?>
Turns to <Foo item="Bar">Value here</Foo>

Example of using classes with soapcalls:
<?php
    $client = ExtendSoapClient::getInstance();
    $foo = new Foo();
    $response = $client->sendFoo($foo);
?>

Posted these since I think the documentation is lacking and very obsolete.
Hopefully someone's burden eases.

If you are calling a weblogic service with a certificate and you are getting
this error on the soap method call statement:

[EJB:010160]Security Violation: User: '<anonymous>' has insufficient permission
to access EJB: type=<ejb>, application=app2_0_52_3, module=appsejb.jar, ejb=
AppMethod, method=AppMethod, methodInterface=Remote, signature=
{java.lang.String}.

then check the wsdl in the soap open call - it must be https.  Supplied with an
http wsdl this took some time to figure out.

<?php
    $client = new SoapClient("https://example.com/AppWs/Service?WSDL",
                array('trace'=>true,
                      'exceptions'=>true,
                      'local_cert' => "/var/www/html/app/newcert.pem",
                      'passphrase' => "thepassphrase"));
    $response = $client->__soapCall("MyMethod", array("param1" => $value1));
?>

Thanks to the authors for their comments on enabling openssl and curl by
uncommenting extension=php_opensll.dll and extension=php_curl.dll in php.ini. 
Also for Olaf's instructions "append the content of the private key file and
the certificate file to a single file". I did this using copy command on the
DOS prompt:

copy mycert.pem+mykey.pem newcert.pem

ZMQDevice::setTimerCallback — Set the timer callback function

说明

public ZMQDevice ZMQDevice::setTimerCallback ( callable $cb_func , integer
$timeout [, mixed $user_data ] )

Sets the timer callback function. The timer callback will be invoked after
timeout has passed. The difference between idle and timer callbacks are that
idle callback is invoked only when the device is idle. The callback function
signature is callback (mixed $user_data). Added in ZMQ extension version 1.1.0.

参数

cb_func

    Callback function to invoke when the device is idle. Returning false or a
    value that evaluates to false from this function will cause the device to
    stop.

timeout

    How often to invoke the idle callback in milliseconds. The idle callback is
    invoked periodically when there is no activity on the device. The timeout
    value guarantees that there is at least this amount of milliseconds between
    invocations of the callback function.

user_data

    Additional data to pass to the callback function.

返回值

On success this method returns the current object.

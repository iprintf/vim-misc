The EvTimer class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

EvTimer watchers are simple relative timers that generate an event after a
given time, and optionally repeating in regular intervals after that.

The timers are based on real time, that is, if one registers an event that
times out after an hour and resets the system clock to January last year , it
will still time out after(roughly) one hour. "Roughly" because detecting time
jumps is hard, and some inaccuracies are unavoidable.

The callback is guaranteed to be invoked only after its timeout has passed (not
at, so on systems with very low-resolution clocks this might introduce a small
delay). If multiple timers become ready during the same loop iteration then the
ones with earlier time-out values are invoked before ones of the same priority
with later time-out values (but this is no longer true when a callback calls 
EvLoop::run() recursively).

The timer itself will do a best-effort at avoiding drift, that is, if a timer
is configured to trigger every 10 seconds, then it will normally trigger at
exactly 10 second intervals. If, however, the script cannot keep up with the
timer because it takes longer than those 10 seconds to do) the timer will not
fire more than once per event loop iteration.

属性

repeat

    If repeat is 0.0 , then it will automatically be stopped once the timeout
    is reached. If it is positive, then the timer will automatically be
    configured to trigger again every repeat seconds later, until stopped
    manually.

remaining

    Returns the remaining time until a timer fires. If the timer is active,
    then this time is relative to the current event loop time, otherwise it's
    the timeout value currently configured.

    That is, after instanciating an EvTimer with an after value of 5.0 and
    repeat value of 7.0 , remaining returns 5.0 . When the timer is started and
    one second passes, remaining will return 4.0 . When the timer expires and
    is restarted, it will return roughly 7.0 (likely slightly less as callback
    invocation takes some time too), and so on.

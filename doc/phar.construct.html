Example #1 A Phar::__construct() example

<?php

    $p = new Phar('/path/to/my.phar', FilesystemIterator::CURRENT_AS_FILEINFO |
 FilesystemIterator::KEY_AS_FILENAME,
                  'my.phar');
} catch (UnexpectedValueException $e) {

// and works as if we had typed
echo file_get_contents('phar:///path/to/my.phar/example.txt');
?>

===============================================================================

Zip support seems to be shaky, in that just attempting to open a Zip file
(created by 7-Zip) with both the 'zlib' and 'zip' extensions enabled renders
the following error:

Error: Cannot convert phar archive "C:/Development/webdir/public_html/
TestPhar.zip", unable to open entry "TestPhar/" contents: phar error: internal
corruption of zip-based phar "C:/Development/webdir/public_html/TestPhar.zip"
(local header of file "TestPhar/" does not match central directory)

Stick to GZ's and BZ2's (but don't forget to enable the BZ2 extension if
necessary).

Phar can ONLY open executable Phar's and PharData can ONLY open non-executable
Phar's. Both have the ability to convert between the two formats.

However, you can reference a file within a Phar regardless of whether it's
executable using the Phar stream wrapper (file_get_contents('phar://<Phar file>
/subdirectory/subdirectory/somefile.txt')).

===============================================================================

It's not possible to create a new archive when safe_mode is enabled! You simply
return a 'Phar creation or opening failed' error.
This applies to Phar and PharData in PHP 5.3.2.

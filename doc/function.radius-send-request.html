radius_send_request — Sends the request and waites for a reply

说明

int radius_send_request ( resource $radius_handle )

After the Radius request has been constructed, it is sent by 
radius_send_request().

The radius_send_request() function sends the request and waits for a valid
reply, retrying the defined servers in round-robin fashion as necessary.

返回值

If a valid response is received, radius_send_request() returns the Radius code
which specifies the type of the response. This will typically be
RADIUS_ACCESS_ACCEPT, RADIUS_ACCESS_REJECT, or RADIUS_ACCESS_CHALLENGE. If no
valid response is received, radius_send_request() returns FALSE.

===============================================================================

Don't forget that you can't be connected to the mailbox that you are going to
rename (or delete).

If you have the following mailboxes:
INBOX
INBOX.Foo

...and want to rename "INBOX.Foo" to "INBOX.Bar" you have to be connected to
"INBOX":

<?php
$mbox = imap_open('{imap.example.com}INBOX', 'username', 'password');
imap_renamemailbox($mbox, '{imap.example.com}INBOX.Foo', '{imap.example.com}
INBOX.Bar');
imap_close($mbox);
?>
===============================================================================

Don't let "...string old_mbox, string new_mbox);" fool you. You have to add the
server and port to the mailbox name also. So it would be something like:

imap_renamemailbox($mailbox, "{localhost:143}$oldfolder", "{localhost:143}
$newfolder")

Just thought I would point it out, it took me a while to figure it out.

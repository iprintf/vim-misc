metaphone — Calculate the metaphone key of a string

说明

string metaphone ( string $str [, int $phonemes = 0 ] )

Calculates the metaphone key of str.

Similar to soundex() metaphone creates the same key for similar sounding words.
It's more accurate than soundex() as it knows the basic rules of English
pronunciation. The metaphone generated keys are of variable length.

Metaphone was developed by Lawrence Philips <lphilips at verity dot com>. It is
described in ["Practical Algorithms for Programmers", Binstock & Rex, Addison
Wesley, 1995].

参数

str

    The input string.

phonemes

    This parameter restricts the returned metaphone key to phonemes characters
    in length. The default value of 0 means no restriction.

返回值

Returns the metaphone key as a string, 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 metaphone() basic example

<?php
var_dump(metaphone('programming'));
var_dump(metaphone('programmer'));
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

string(7) "PRKRMNK"
string(6) "PRKRMR"

Example #2 Using the phonemes parameter

<?php
var_dump(metaphone('programming', 5));
var_dump(metaphone('programmer', 5));
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

string(5) "PRKRM"
string(5) "PRKRM"

===============================================================================

you can use the metaphone function quite effectively with phrases by taking the
levenshtein distances between two metaphone codes, and then taking this as a
percentage of the length of the original metaphone code. thus you can define a
percentage error, (say 20%) and accept only matches that are closer than that.
i've found this works quite effectively in a function i am using on my website
where an album name that the user entered is verified against existing album
names that may be similar. this is also an excellent way of people being able
to vaguely remember a phrase and get several suggestions out of the database.
so you could type "i stiched nine times" with an error percentage of, say, 50
and still get 'a stitch in time saves nine' back as a match.

A double metaphone pecl module is available: http://pecl.php.net/package/

Metaphone() apparently ignores non-English characters.  Comparing Plaçe TO
Place yields "PL" and "PLS."  A similar result comes from soundex().

metaphone
=======================
The metaphone() function can be used for spelling applications.This function
returns the metaphone key of the string on success, or FALSE on failure.Its
main use is when you are searching a genealogy database. check to see if a
metaphone search is offered. It is also useful in making/searching family tree.
Given below is a simple code that calculates and compares two strings to find
whether its metaphone codes are equivalent.

html code
==========
<html>
<body>
<form action="test.php" name="test" method="get">
Name1:<input type="text" name="name1" /><br />
Name2:<input type="text" name="name2" /><br />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="compare" />
</form>

<!--php code begins here -->

<?php
if(isset($_GET['submit']))
{
$str1 = $_GET['name1'];
$str2 = $_GET['name2'];
$meta_one=metaphone($str1);
$meta_two=metaphone($str2);
echo "metaphone code for ".$str1." is ". $meta_one;
echo "<br />";
echo "metaphone code for ".$str2." is ". $meta_two."<br>";
if($meta_one==$meta_two)
{
echo "metaphone codes are matching";
}
else
{
echo "metaphone codes are not matching";
}

Metaphone  algorithm was developed by Lawrence Philips.

Lawrence Philips' RULES follow:

The 16 consonant sounds:
                                             |--- ZERO represents "th"
                                             |
      B  X  S  K  J  T  F  H  L  M  N  P  R  0  W  Y

Exceptions:

   Beginning of word: "ae-", "gn", "kn-", "pn-", "wr-"  ----> drop first letter
                      "Aebersold", "Gnagy", "Knuth", "Pniewski", "Wright"

   Beginning of word: "x"                                ----> change to "s"
                                      as in "Deng Xiaopeng"

   Beginning of word: "wh-"                              ----> change to "w"
                                      as in "Whalen"

Transformations:

   B ----> B      unless at the end of word after "m", as in "dumb", "McComb"

   C ----> X      (sh) if "-cia-" or "-ch-"
           S      if "-ci-", "-ce-", or "-cy-"
                  SILENT if "-sci-", "-sce-", or "-scy-"
           K      otherwise, including in "-sch-"

   D ----> J      if in "-dge-", "-dgy-", or "-dgi-"
           T      otherwise

   F ----> F

   G ---->        SILENT if in "-gh-" and not at end or before a vowel
                            in "-gn" or "-gned"
                            in "-dge-" etc., as in above rule
           J      if before "i", or "e", or "y" if not double "gg"
           K      otherwise

   H ---->        SILENT if after vowel and no vowel follows
                         or after "-ch-", "-sh-", "-ph-", "-th-", "-gh-"

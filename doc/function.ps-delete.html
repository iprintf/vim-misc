ps_delete

(PECL ps >= 1.1.0)

ps_delete — Deletes all resources of a PostScript document

说明

bool ps_delete ( resource $psdoc )

Mainly frees memory used by the document. Also closes a file, if it was not
closed before with ps_close(). You should in any case close the file with 
ps_close() before, because ps_close() not just closes the file but also outputs
a trailor containing PostScript comments like the number of pages in the
document and adding the bookmark hierarchy.

参数

psdoc

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by ps_new().

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

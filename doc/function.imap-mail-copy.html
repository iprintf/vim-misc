===============================================================================

When we want to copy more than one mail, we can write '(string)' before
msg_num. Like..

$msg_num = "1,2,3,4,5,6,7";
$copy = imap_mail_copy($imap_stream, (string) $msg_num, '[Gmail]/Important',
CP_UID);
===============================================================================

If you use this function and you get the following notice:

Notice: Unknown: IMAP protocol error: Could not parse command (errflg=2) in
Unknown on line 0

Notice: Unknown: Could not parse command (errflg=2) in Unknown on line 0

you should check the function parameters. This notice appears (according to
what I found on the internet and my problems) when it gets an invalid $msglist.
So be sure to give the right number (as a String!):
"$msg_num", $msg_num or (string) $msg_num.

Dont use '$msg_num' when calling the function, this will literally send the
string $msg_num.
You can give a string like "1,3,5,7,8", which will work perfectly fine to move
the given mails.

I had all my mailnumbers in an array ( $messageSet) and used

<?php
$messageSetImpl = implode ( "," , $messageSet );

imap_mail_copy( $imapStream, $messageSetImpl, $mailBox )
?>

What I hadn't had thougt of was that my $messageSet was sometimes empty, that
was when I got the notice. So you might want to check that by putting first:

<?php
if ( !( empty( $messageSet ) ) ) {

$messageSetImpl = implode ( "," , $messageSet );

imap_mail_copy( $imapStream, $messageSetImpl, $mailBox )

}
?>

That should work.
===============================================================================

If you are having problems getting imap_mail_copy and imap_mail_move to work,
check you have installed imap_devel (the imap development libraries) as well as
imap (the imap daemon). Without it, PHP appears to configure correctly
--with-imap, but some functions do not work.

It took me about 12 hours to figure this out!!
===============================================================================

After much fooling around, imap_mail_copy did work for me. One thing you might
want to check, if you are having problems, is the new mailbox name. Make sure
it is just a folder name, e.g. INBOX.haha without the server part.
===============================================================================

imap_ mail_ move and imap_mail_copy don't work with sequence numbers on MS
Exchange. imap_ uid in combination with CP_UID works fine.

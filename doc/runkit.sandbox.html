(PECL runkit >= 0.7.0)

Runkit_Sandbox — Runkit Sandbox Class -- PHP Virtual Machine

说明

Instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox class creates a new thread with its own scope
and program stack. Using a set of options passed to the constructor, this
environment may be restricted to a subset of what the primary interpreter can
do and provide a safer environment for executing user supplied code.

    Note: 沙箱支持（是 runkit_lint()，runkit_lint_file() 函数，与
    Runkit_Sandbox 类所必需）仅可用于 PHP 5.1.0 或 PHP 5.0 的特别修补版本，并需
    启用线程安全。更多信息可参见 runkit 包中的 README 文件。

Constructor

void Runkit_Sandbox::__construct ([ array $options ] )

options is an associative array containing any combination of the special ini
options listed below.

safe_mode

    If the outer script which is instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox class is
    configured with safe_mode = off, then safe_mode may be turned on for the
    sandbox environment. This setting can not be used to disable safe_mode when
    it's already enabled in the outer script.

safe_mode_gid

    If the outer script which is instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox class is
    configured with safe_mode_gid = on, then safe_mode_gid may be turned off
    for the sandbox environment. This setting can not be used to enable
    safe_mode_gid when it's already disabled in the outer script.

safe_mode_include_dir

    If the outer script which is instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox class is
    configured with a safe_mode_include_dir, then a new safe_mode_include_dir
    may be set for sandbox environments below the currently defined value.
    safe_mode_include_dir may also be cleared to indicate that the bypass
    feature is disabled. If safe_mode_include_dir was blank in the outer
    script, but safe_mode was not enabled, then any arbitrary
    safe_mode_include_dir may be set while turning safe_mode on.

open_basedir

    open_basedir may be set to any path below the current setting of
    open_basedir. If open_basedir is not set within the global scope, then it
    is assumed to be the root directory and may be set to any location.

allow_url_fopen

    Like safe_mode, this setting can only be made more restrictive, in this
    case by setting it to FALSE when it is previously set to TRUE

disable_functions

    Comma separated list of functions to disable within the sandbox
    sub-interpreter. This list need not contain the names of the currently
    disabled functions, they will remain disabled whether listed here or not.

disable_classes

    Comma separated list of classes to disable within the sandbox
    sub-interpreter. This list need not contain the names of the currently
    disabled classes, they will remain disabled whether listed here or not.

runkit.superglobal

    Comma separated list of variables to be treated as superglobals within the
    sandbox sub-interpreter. These variables will be used in addition to any
    variables defined internally or through the global runkit.superglobal
    setting.

runkit.internal_override

    Ini option runkit.internal_override may be disabled (but not re-enabled)
    within sandboxes.

Example #1 Instantiating a restricted sandbox

<?php
$options = array(
  'safe_mode'=>true,
  'open_basedir'=>'/var/www/users/jdoe/',
  'allow_url_fopen'=>'false',
  'disable_functions'=>'exec,shell_exec,passthru,system',
  'disable_classes'=>'myAppClass');
$sandbox = new Runkit_Sandbox($options);
/* Non-protected ini settings may set normally */
$sandbox->ini_set('html_errors',true);
?>

Accessing Variables

All variables in the global scope of the sandbox environment are accessible as
properties of the sandbox object. The first thing to note is that because of
the way memory between these two threads is managed, object and resource
variables can not currently be exchanged between interpreters. Additionally,
all arrays are deep copied and any references will be lost. This also means
that references between interpreters are not possible.

Example #2 Working with variables in a sandbox

<?php
$sandbox = new Runkit_Sandbox();

$sandbox->foo = 'bar';
$sandbox->eval('echo "$foo\n"; $bar = $foo . "baz";');
echo "{$sandbox->bar}\n";
if (isset($sandbox->foo)) unset($sandbox->foo);
$sandbox->eval('var_dump(isset($foo));');
?>

以上例程会输出：

bar
barbaz
bool(false)

Calling PHP Functions

Any function defined within the sandbox may be called as a method on the
sandbox object. This also includes a few pseudo-function language constructs: 
eval(), include, include_once, require, require_once, echo, print, die(), and 
exit().

Example #3 Calling sandbox functions

<?php
$sandbox = new Runkit_Sandbox();

echo $sandbox->str_replace('a','f','abc');
?>

以上例程会输出：

fbc

When passing arguments to a sandbox function, the arguments are taken from the
outer instance of PHP. If you wish to pass arguments from the sandbox's scope,
be sure to access them as properties of the sandbox object as illustrated
above.

Example #4 Passing arguments to sandbox functions

<?php
$sandbox = new Runkit_Sandbox();

$foo = 'bar';
$sandbox->foo = 'baz';
echo $sandbox->str_replace('a',$foo,'a');
echo $sandbox->str_replace('a',$sandbox->foo,'a');
?>

以上例程会输出：

bar
baz

Changing Sandbox Settings

As of runkit version 0.5, certain Sandbox settings may be modified on the fly
using ArrayAccess syntax. Some settings, such as active are read-only and meant
to provide status information. Other settings, such as output_handler may be
set and read much like a normal array offset. Future settings may be
write-only, however no such settings currently exist.

                     Sandbox Settings / Status Indicators
   Setting       Type                      Purpose                     Default
               Boolean  TRUE if the Sandbox is still in a usable
active         (Read    state, FALSE if the request is in bailout due TRUE
               Only)    to a call to die(), exit(), or because of a   (Initial)
                        fatal error condition.
                        When set to a valid callback, all output
                        generated by the Sandbox instance will be
output_handler Callback processed through the named function. Sandbox None
                        output handlers follow the same calling
                        conventions as the system-wide output
                        handler.
                        May the sandbox use instances of the
parent_access  Boolean  Runkit_Sandbox_Parent class? Must be enabled  FALSE
                        for other Runkit_Sandbox_Parent related
                        settings to work.
parent_read    Boolean  May the sandbox read variables in its         FALSE
                        parent's context?
parent_write   Boolean  May the sandbox modify variables in its       FALSE
                        parent's context?
parent_eval    Boolean  May the sandbox evaluate arbitrary code in    FALSE
                        its parent's context? DANGEROUS
parent_include Boolean  May the sandbox include php code files in its FALSE
                        parent's context? DANGEROUS
                        May the sandbox echo data in its parent's
parent_echo    Boolean  context effectively bypassing its own         FALSE
                        output_handler?
parent_call    Boolean  May the sandbox call functions in its         FALSE
                        parent's context?
parent_die     Boolean  May the sandbox kill its own parent? (And     FALSE
                        thus itself)
                        What scope will parental property access look
parent_scope   Integer  at? 0 == Global scope, 1 == Calling scope, 2  0
                        == Scope preceding calling scope, 3 == The    (Global)
                        scope before that, etc..., etc...
                        When parent_scope is set to a string value,
                        it refers to a named array variable in the
                        global scope. If the named variable does not
parent_scope   String   exist at the time of access it will be         
                        created as an empty array. If the variable
                        exists but it not an array, a dummy array
                        will be created containing a reference to the
                        named global variable.

DOMDocument::loadXML

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

DOMDocument::loadXML — Load XML from a string

说明

public mixed DOMDocument::loadXML ( string $source [, int $options = 0 ] )

Loads an XML document from a string.

参数

source

    The string containing the XML.

options

    Bitwise OR of the libxml option constants.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。 If called statically, returns a
DOMDocument 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

错误／异常

If an empty string is passed as the source, a warning will be generated. This
warning is not generated by libxml and cannot be handled using libxml's error
handling functions.

此方法可以被静态调用,但会抛出一个 E_STRICT 错误。

范例

Example #1 Creating a Document

<?php
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc->loadXML('<root><node/></root>');
echo $doc->saveXML();
?>

Example #2 Static invocation of loadXML

<?php
// Issues an E_STRICT error
$doc = DOMDocument::loadXML('<root><node/></root>');
echo $doc->saveXML();
?>

Always remember that with the default parameters this function doesn't handle
well large files, i.e. if a text node is longer than 10Mb it can raise an
exception stating:

DOMDocument::loadXML(): internal error Extra content at the end of the document
in Entity

even though the XML is fine.

The cause is a definition in parserInternals.h of lixml:
#define XML_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH 10000000

To allow the function to process larger files, pass the LIBXML_PARSEHUGE as an
option and it will work just fine:

$domDocument->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_PARSEHUGE);

earth at anonymous dot com,

preserveWhiteSpace property needs to be set to false for formatOutput to work
properly, for some reason.

$dom = new DOMDocument;
$dom->preserveWhiteSpace = false;
$dom->loadXML($xmlStr);
...
$element->appendChild(...);
...
$dom->formatOutput = true;
$xmlStr = $dom->saveXML();
echo $xmlStr;

This would format the output nicely.
===============================================================================

For some reason, when you set DOMDocument's property 'recover' to true, using
'@' to mask errors thrown by loadXml() won't work.

Here's my workaround:

function maskErrors() {}
set_error_handler('maskErrors');
$dom->loadXml($xml);
restore_error_handler();

You could also simply do this: error_reporting(0); and then set back
error_reporting to its original state.
===============================================================================

loadXml reports an error instead of throwing an exception when the xml is not
well formed. This is annoying if you are trying to to loadXml() in a
try...catch statement. Apparently its a feature, not a bug, because this
conforms to a spefication.

If you want to catch an exception instead of generating a report, you could do
something like

<?php
function HandleXmlError($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline)
{
    if ($errno==E_WARNING && (substr_count($errstr,"DOMDocument::loadXML()")>0
))
    {
        throw new DOMException($errstr);
    }
    else
        return false;
}

function XmlLoader($strXml)
{
    set_error_handler('HandleXmlError');
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXml($strXml);   
    restore_error_handler();
    return $dom;
}

?>

Returning false in function HandleXmlError() causes a fallback to the default
error handler.
===============================================================================

When using loadXML() to parse a string that contains entity references (e.g., &
nbsp;), be sure that those entity references are properly declared through the
use of a DOCTYPE declaration; otherwise, loadXML() will not be able to
interpret the string.

Example:
<?php
$str = <<<XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<div>This&nbsp;is a non-breaking space.</div>
XML;

$dd1 = new DOMDocument();
$dd1->loadXML($str);

echo $dd1->saveXML();
?>

Given the above code, PHP will issue a Warning about the entity 'nbsp' not
being properly declared.  Also, the call to saveXML() will return nothing but a
trimmed-down version of the original processing instruction...everything else
is gone, and all because of the undeclared entity.

Instead, explicitly declare the entity first:
<?php
$str = <<<XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
<!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;">
]>
<div>This&nbsp;is a non-breaking space.</div>
XML;

$dd2 = new DOMDocument();
$dd2->loadXML($str);

echo $dd2->saveXML();
?>

Since the 'nbsp' entity is defined in the DOCTYPE, PHP no longer issues that
Warning; the string is now well-formed, and loadXML() understands it perfectly.

You can also use references to external DTDs in the same way (e.g., <!DOCTYPE
HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">), which is particularly important if
you need to do this for many different documents with many different possible
entities.

Also, as a sidenote...entity references created by createEntityReference() do
not need this kind of explicit declaration.
===============================================================================

Possible values for the options parameter can be found here:

===============================================================================

The documentation states that loadXML can be called statically, but this is
misleading. This feature seems to be a special case hack and its use seems to
be discouraged according to http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41398.

Calling the method statically will fail with an error if the code runs with
E_STRICT error reporting enabled.

The documentation should be changed to make it clear that a static call is
against recommended practice and won't work with E_STRICT.
===============================================================================

While loadXML() expects its input to have a leading XML processing instruction
to deduce the encoding used, there's no such concept in (non-XML) HTML
documents. Thus, the libxml library underlying the DOM functions peeks at the
<META> tags to figure out the encoding used.

See http://xmlsoft.org/encoding.html.
===============================================================================

Instead of doing this:

<?php
$str = <<<XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
<!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;">
]>
<div>This&nbsp;is a non-breaking space.</div>
XML;

$dd2 = new DOMDocument();
$dd2->loadXML($str);

echo $dd2->saveXML();
?>

simply use:

loadHTML() rather than loadXML().
===============================================================================

Note that loadXML crops off beginning and trailing whitespace and linebreaks.

When using loadXML and appendChild to add a chunk of XML to an existing
document, you may want to force a linebreak between the end of the XML chunk
and the next line (usually a close tag) in the output file:

$childDocument = new DOMDocument;
$childDocument>preserveWhiteSpace = true;
$childDocument->loadXML(..XML-Chunk..);
$mNewNode = $mainDOcument->importNode($childDocument->documentElement, true);
$ParentNode->appendChild($mNewNode);
$ParentNode->appendChild($mainDocument->createTextNode("\\n  ");

Although it is said that DOM should not be used to make 'pretty' XML output, it
is something I struggled with to get something that was readable for testing. 
Another solution is to use the createDocumentFragment()->appendXML
(..XML-Chunk..) instead, which seems not to trim off linebreaks like
DOMDocument->loadXML() does.
===============================================================================

Loading from a string works fine without the <?xml version="1.0" encoding=
"utf-8"?> header, but in this case the xmlEncoding won't be set, and this makes
the utf-8 characters (international, and special characters) to be encoded as
hexa entities when saved with saveXML()!

shm_attach

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

shm_attach — Creates or open a shared memory segment

说明

resource shm_attach ( int $key [, int $memsize [, int $perm = 0666 ]] )

shm_attach() returns an id that can be used to access the System V shared
memory with the given key, the first call creates the shared memory segment
with memsize and the optional perm-bits perm.

A second call to shm_attach() for the same key will return a different shared
memory identifier, but both identifiers access the same underlying shared
memory. memsize and perm will be ignored.

参数

key

    A numeric shared memory segment ID

memsize

    The memory size. If not provided, default to the sysvshm.init_mem in the
    php.ini, otherwise 10000 bytes.

perm

    The optional permission bits. Default to 0666.

返回值

Returns a shared memory segment identifier.

更新日志

版本                                说明
5.3.0 This function now returns a 资源(resource) instead of an integer.

注释

    Note:

    This function used to return an integer value prior to PHP 5.3.0. To
    achieve the same value in a portable manner, the return value can be cast
    to an integer like:

    <?php
    // Create a temporary file and return its path
    $tmp = tempnam('/tmp', 'PHP');

    // Get the file token key
    $key = ftok($tmp, 'a');

    // Attach the SHM resource, notice the cast afterwards
    $id = shm_attach($key);

    if ($id === false) {
        die('Unable to create the shared memory segment');
    }

    // Cast to integer, since prior to PHP 5.3.0 the resource id 
    // is returned which can be exposed when casting a resource
    // to an integer
    $id = (integer) $id;
    ?>

I was playing around with these functions and made a class in the process. This
will of course be slower than accessing a variable locally, but gives the
ability to store variables in a shared environment and gives many running
scripts the understanding that it should access them from the shared area. This
should also auto destroy the shared memory area once no more scripts have a
link to the data (when all scripts use this class).

<?php
class SharedMemory{
    private $nameToKey = array();
    private $key;
    private $id;
    function __construct($key = null){
        if($key === null){
            $tmp = tempnam('/tmp', 'PHP');
            $this->key = ftok($tmp, 'a');
            $this->id = shm_attach($this->key);
            $this->nameToKey[] = '';
            $this->nameToKey[] = '';
            $this->updateMemoryVarList();
            shm_put_var($this->id, 1, 1);
        }else{
            $this->key = $key;
            $this->id = sem_get($this->key);
            $this->refreshMemoryVarList();
            shm_put_var($this->id, 1, shm_get_var($this->id, 1) + 1);
        }
        if(!$this->id)
            die('Unable to create shared memory segment');
    }
    function __sleep(){
        shm_detach($this->id);
    }
    function __destruct(){
        if(shm_get_var($this->id, 1) == 1){
            // I am the last listener so kill shared memory space

4194304 means 4 MB and NOT 4 GB for shared memory on FreeBSD. You can increase
the shared memory at runtime if you like.
===============================================================================

With Sun Solaris 2.x, the MAXIMUM shared memory value allowed is 1,048,576. 
The maximum allowed value can be determined using the command /usr/sbin/
sysdef.  On Linux, there does not seem to be any system enforced maximum size. 
To change the maximum allowed size on Solaris 2.x, use set
shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=[new value].
===============================================================================

If you get an error like "PHP Warning:  shm_attach(): failed for key
0x61040bb5: Cannot allocate memory" then you might need to tweak your shared
memory configuration.

To see your system values, enter "sysctl kern.sysv."
Important values are kern.sysv.shmmax and kern.sysv.shmall:
* kern.sysv.shmmax is the max number of bytes one shared memory segment may
have
* kern.sysv.shmall is the max number of memory pages all shared memory segments
together can consume
One memory page is 4096 bytes, meaning that if you set kern.sysv.shmmax to
1073741824 (1GB) then kern.sysv.shmall must be at least 262144 to be able to
allocate a one GB memory segment (since 262144 * 4096 = 1073741824).

tl;dr The default values on some systems are very low and then it is not enough
to only increase kern.sysv.shmmax - also kern.sysv.shmall needs to be increased
accordingly!
===============================================================================

<?php

//how to calculate the  minimum $memsize required to store the variable $foo
where $foo='foobar'.

// when shm_attach() is called for the first time, PHP writes a header to the
beginning of the shared memory.
$shmHeaderSize = (PHP_INT_SIZE * 4) + 8;

// when shm_put_var() is called, the variable is serialized and a small header
is placed in front of it before it is written to shared memory.
$shmVarSize = (((strlen(serialize($foo))+ (4 * PHP_INT_SIZE)) /4 ) * 4 ) + 4;

// now add the two together to get the total memory required. Of course, if you
are storing more than one variable then you dont need to add $shmHeaderSize for
each variable, only add it once.
$memsize = $shmHeaderSize + $shmVarSize;

//this will give you just enough memory to store the one variable using
shm_put_var().
$shm_id = shm_attach ( $key, $memsize, 0666 ) ;
shm_put_var  ( $shm_id  , $variable_key  , $foo  );

any attempt to store another variable will result in a 'not enough memory' 
error.
Be aware that if you change the contents of $foo to a larger value and then you
try to write it to shared memory again using shm_put_var(), then you will get a
'not enough memory' error. In this case, you will have to resize your shared
memory segment and then write the new value.

If you are only storing variables that contain a single integer value, then you
can avoid having to resize by always allocating the largest amount of memory
that is required to store an int, which should be:
$shmIntVarSize = (((strlen(serialize(PHP_INT_MAX))+ (4 * PHP_INT_SIZE)) /4 ) * 
4 ) + 4;

Hi :)

I tried all the suggestions above for getting the object size (in bytes) for
$memsize, but they didn't work universally for the two types of objects I tried
(string and array of strings).

After doing some googling and experimenting, I've found the following magic
formula:

$memsize = ( strlen( serialize( $object ) ) + 44 ) * 2;

I found this in someone else's code, so I can't explain it.
===============================================================================

As a follow-up to my last post regarding shm_attach and its limit capability
for knowing how it was created....

for more control, use the shmop_* series of functions, as they have finer
grained control than these.

and by the way:  the SHMOP functions SHOULD BE listed under "see also" for all
the SHM* wrapper functions (I assume they are wrappers to the SHMOP*
functions).
===============================================================================

Since there aren't seperate functions for CREATING and ATTACHING shared memory
(a mistake in my opinion), you might want to do some testing to check whether
you've created it or not, as you may not want the slave of a master/slave pair
to ever create the shared memory.

One way you can test this is by having your slave set the size to something
small, then testing the size by putting a variable too large to fit, e.g.:

function get_shmem() {
     return shm_attach(ftok('somefile.txt', 'T'), 100, 0644);
}

$shm = get_shmem();

while (!@shm_put_var($shm, 1, str_repeat('.....', 20))) {
     shm_remove($shm);
     sleep(1);
     //we created it, so we'll remove it and sleep to wait for the master to
create it, then try again.
     $shm = get_shmem();
}
shm_remove_var($shm, 1);
//here we know the shared memory was already created, because we could put a
variable in bigger than the size requested.

Another way you can handle it is to have all programs initialize the shared
memory with the same parameters... I had a problem with this when my clients
starting too fast and created the shmem without passing a memsize value, so it
was defaulting to 10k which was too small.
===============================================================================

The limit for one SHM block seems to be 32 MB, but you can split your data in
several SHM blocks if you need to. The total SHM limit seems to be about 8 GB.

I'm not sure whether this is true for all configurations.
===============================================================================

If one process make a shm_attach to one inexistent memory area, this area will
be created under the same priviliegies of the script running user. If another
process will try to create or acces the same area, runnig by other user with
different privileges of the first user, an error will occur.
===============================================================================

Cecil, the key of a var is an integer (not the name ). You can put multiples
vars in the same share.

#!/usr/local/bin/php -q
<?PHP

$SHM_KEY = ftok(__FILE__, chr( 4 ) );

$data =  shm_attach($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0666);

$test1 = array("hello","world","1","2","3");
$test2 = array("hello","world","4","5","6");
$test3 = array("hello","world","7","8","9");

shm_put_var($data, 1, $test1);
shm_put_var($data, 2,$test2);
shm_put_var($data, 3,$test3);

print_r(shm_get_var($data, 1));
print_r(shm_get_var($data, 2));
print_r(shm_get_var($data, 3));

shm_detach($data);
?>
===============================================================================

As far as I see from the sources of ext/sysvshm, it's not needed to  do 
arithmetic (bit) OR (|) of "perm" with  IPC_CREAT (and IPC_EXCL). The extension
will do it for you. It tries to attach to the memory segment and if the try did
not succeed it tries to attach but with flags set to user_flag | IPC_CREAT |
IPC_EXCL.
The exact code (shm_flag is the third param to the function) :
if ((shm_id = shmget(shm_key, 0, 0)) < 0) {
      if (shm_size < sizeof(sysvshm_chunk_head)) {
            php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "failed for key 0x%x:
memorysize too small", shm_key);
            efree(shm_list_ptr);
            RETURN_FALSE;
      }
      if ((shm_id = shmget(shm_key, shm_size, shm_flag | IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL))
< 0) {
            php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "failed for key 0x%x:
%s", shm_key, strerror(errno));
             efree(shm_list_ptr);
             RETURN_FALSE;
     }
}
===============================================================================

Here is an example of how to use one shared memory block to store multiple
variables or arrays.. unfortunetly in order to store more than ONE variable,
you have to use sem_get() multiple times.. same goes for shm_attach(),
shm_put_var() and shm_get_var()

#!/usr/local/bin/php -q
<?PHP
// test.php

$SHM_KEY = ftok(__FILE__,'A');

$shmid  = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);
$shmid2 = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);
$shmid3 = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);

$data =  shm_attach($shmid, 1024);
$data2 = shm_attach($shmid2, 1024);
$data3 = shm_attach($shmid3, 1024);

$test = array("hello","world","1","2","3");
$test2 = array("hello","world","4","5","6");
$test3 = array("hello","world","7","8","9");

shm_put_var($data,$inmem,$test);
shm_put_var($data2,$inmem2,$test2);
shm_put_var($data3,$inmem3,$test3);

print_r(shm_get_var($data,$inmem));
print_r(shm_get_var($data2,$inmem2));
print_r(shm_get_var($data3,$inmem3));

shm_detach($data);
shm_detach($data2);
shm_detach($data2);
?>

to REALLY test it.. create a second script like so and run it..

#!/usr/local/bin/php -q
<?PHP
// test2.php

$SHM_KEY = ftok(__FILE__,'A');

$shmid  = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);
$shmid2 = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);
$shmid3 = sem_get($SHM_KEY, 1024, 0644 | IPC_CREAT);

$data =  shm_attach($shmid, 1024);
$data2 = shm_attach($shmid2, 1024);
$data3 = shm_attach($shmid3, 1024);

print_r(shm_get_var($data,$inmem));
print_r(shm_get_var($data2,$inmem2));
print_r(shm_get_var($data3,$inmem3));

shm_detach($data);
shm_detach($data2);
shm_detach($data2);
?>

As you can see, test2.php doesn't insert anything into shared memory.. yet it
pulls out 3 totally different arrays already stored..

Hope that helps.. took me a bit to get it right.. everyone seems to have their
own idea of how shm should be used. lol.

BTW, not sure how the ftok works to be honest, cause I didn't change the
__FILE__ to match the file path of test.php or anything.. I would think that
the file path out have to be the exact same to work correctly.. oh well, it
worked as-is! haha..

Notice that 'int key' for shared-memory is shared with the keys used for
semaphores. So you get in trouble when you use the same key value for
semaphores and shared memory!
===============================================================================

Objects are stored serialized in shm_put_var, so to find a value for memsize,
you can use strlen(serialize($object_to_store_in_shm)).
===============================================================================

You might expect the SHM functions to be significantly faster than building
variables from MySQL operations. Unfortunately this is not the case regarding
large multidimensional arrays. I've tested write, read, update and delete
operations with with a two dimensional associative array directly with SHM and
in comparison with a class using MySQL and a class using SHMOP functions (with
mostly offset-accurate serialization). Both classes generated the same array as
stored with SHM. Unlike SHMOP the performance of SHM decreases considerably
with larger arrays. At 2000 instructions with an $array[$row][$key] of 200 rows
and 5 keys even MySql is faster than SHM.This might be due to the fact, that
SHM deals with any kind of arrays and makes internal use the PHPs powerful
serialize() function.
===============================================================================

In my log I have found string
"shm_attach(): failed for key 0x366f: No space left on device"
But have not found any suggestion for this at php.net and at google.

So question was how to make free memory used by shm_attach .
At first to view (Linux)  how many segments allocated, use
:~# ipcs -mu
then
limits
:~# ipcs -ml

to remove segment use:
:~# ipcrm -m [shmid]

otherwise you can reboot server, or launch sh script based on commands above.

To avoid troubles with "No space left on device" ALWAYS use
shm_remove() & shm_detach() after call shm_attach().
===============================================================================

A simple Sample to introduce SHM.

<?php
if ( sizeof($argv)<2 ) {
        echo "Usage: $argv[0] send|recv|rem|dele ID [msg] \n\n" ;
        echo "   EX: $argv[0] send 1 \"This is no 1\" \n" ;
        echo "       $argv[0] recv 1 \n" ;
        echo "       $argv[0] rem 1 \n" ;
        echo "       $argv[0] dele \n" ;
        exit;
}

// $SHMKey = ftok(__FILE__, "Z");
$SHMKey = "123456" ;

## Create/Open a shm
$seg = shm_attach( $SHMKey, 1024, 0666 ) ;

switch ( $argv[1] ) {
    case "send":

Responding to jpeter1978 at yahoo dot com ... Assuming a character is typically
two bytes, the size of a serialized variable (incl array or obj) is 2 * its
strlen().  The 44 is 4 more than the 24 + 16 = 40 suggested by php at cytrax
dot de plus 4 bytes for worst case 4-byte alignment.  So this is probably a
reliable formula if you are too lazy to align it using something similar to
zeppelinux at comcast dot net as in:

($strlen($serialized_array_or_obj) /4 ) * 4 ) + 40;

The zeppelinux formula would use 20 (for 4-byte integer cpu) or 36 (for 64-bit
or 8-byte cpu) for the ending constant so 40 or 44 is probably just achieving
header padding but it certainly can't hurt.

The memsize needed for shared memory (tested on linux system) can be calculated
with:

For each varialbe you want to store: 24 Bytes
+ serialized var-size (see below) alligned by 4 Bytes
+ 16 Bytes

For a update of a var with the same key, the memory for the old var will be
needed extra.

Finding out shared memory kernel settings in FreeBSD:

sys1# sysctl -a | grep -i SHM

kern.ipc.shmmax: 4194304
kern.ipc.shmmin: 1
kern.ipc.shmmni: 96
kern.ipc.shmseg: 64
kern.ipc.shmall: 1024
kern.ipc.shm_use_phys: 0

Shows us that we can allocate a total of 4GB (wow) of shared memory, etc...

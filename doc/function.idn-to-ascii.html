(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0, PHP 7, PECL intl >= 1.0.2, PHP 7, PECL idn >= 0.1)

idn_to_ascii — Convert domain name to IDNA ASCII form.

说明

过程化风格

string idn_to_ascii ( string $domain [, int $options = 0 [, int $variant =
INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 [, array &$idna_info ]]] )

This function converts Unicode domain name to IDNA ASCII-compatible format.

参数

domain

    Domain to convert. In PHP 5 must be UTF-8 encoded.

options

    Conversion options - combination of IDNA_* constants (except IDNA_ERROR_*
    constants).

variant

    Either INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 for IDNA 2003 or INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_UTS46 for
    UTS #46.

idna_info

    This parameter can be used only if INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_UTS46 was used for
    variant. In that case, it will be filled with an array with the keys
    'result', the possibly illegal result of the transformation,
    'isTransitionalDifferent', a boolean indicating whether the usage of the
    transitional mechanisms of UTS #46 either has or would have changed the
    result and 'errors', which is an int representing a bitset of the error
    constants IDNA_ERROR_*.

返回值

Domain name encoded in ASCII-compatible form. 或者在失败时返回 FALSE

===============================================================================

The notes on this function are not very clear and a little misleading.

Firstly, <=5.3, you will need to make use of one of several scripts or classes
available on the internet which might, or might not, require the installation
of of the intl and idn PECL extensions ...and you will need to have !<4.0 in
order to be able to install both.

Secondly, if you have >=5.4 you will not require the PECL extensions.

Third, use of utf8_encode() is not necessary.  In fact, it will potentially
prevent idn_to_ascii() from working at all.

On my setup it was necessary to change the charset in the script meta tags to
UTF-8:

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />

...and to change charset_default in the php.ini file (/usr/local/lib/php.ini,
whereis php.ini, find / -name php.ini):

default_charset = "UTF-8"

The above changes mean that idn_to_ascii() can now be used with that syntax (no
need for utf8_encode()).  Previously, the function worked to convert some IDNs,
but failed to convert Japanese and Cyrillic IDNs.  Further, no additional
locales were enabled or added, and Apache's charset file was left unmodified.

It is also important to remember only to apply the function where required, eg:

idn_to_ascii(cåsino.com) // is wrong

...whereas...

iden_to_ascii(cåsino) // is right

...and also be aware of text editors that don't support UTF-8 encoding, or the
$domain = 'cåsino' value will end up as $domain = '??????' ...and the function
will fail.

I have found that Notepad++ easily and reliably handles UTF-8 encoding that
works for this function using UTF-8 as the encoding option, not UTF-8 without
BOM.
===============================================================================

With PHP 5.3 I started to recieve

Fatal error: Only variables can be passed by reference

when trying to call idn_to_ascii with second optional parameter (IDNA_DEFAULT).
Moreover these IDNA_* constants are seem to be undefined in PHP 5.3. + PECL idn
0.0.2

When I tried to uninstall PECL idn and install PECL intl (1.1.1) i recieved
this:

/tmp/pear/temp/intl/collator/collator_class.c:92: error: duplicate ‘static’
/tmp/pear/temp/intl/collator/collator_class.c:96: error: duplicate ‘static’
/tmp/pear/temp/intl/collator/collator_class.c:101: error: duplicate ‘static’
/tmp/pear/temp/intl/collator/collator_class.c:107: error: duplicate ‘static’
make: *** [collator/collator_class.lo] Error 1

So probably compiling PHP 5.3. from sources with --enable-intl will help, but
it only means that PHP 5.3. intl version differs from the one available at
PECL, which isn't good, I think.

I've made my code working again by giving second idn_to_ascii parameter as
simple integer variable (with value 0), but something bad is going on here and
i will not be surprised if it'll break again after another PHP update...

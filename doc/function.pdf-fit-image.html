Hello php cracks

First of all, the reference point of the image is its left, bottom corner.
Furthermore, I just thought it would be nice to know some of the most used
options that can be passed using the fifth parameter "string optlist".

Scaling the image (e.g. by a factor of 0.5)
<?php PDF_fit_image ( $pdf, $img, $x, $y, "scale 0.5" ) ?>

Rotating the image (e.g. by an angle of 45 degrees)
<?php PDF_fit_image ( $pdf, $img, $x, $y, "rotate 45" ) ?>
Note: The reference point rotates with the image!

Fitting the image into a virtual box
<?php PDF_fit_image ( $pdf, $img, $x, $y, "boxsize {200 100} fitmethod meet" ) 
?>
Note: The box width and height (in Adobe points) would be given in the curly
braces. Using the fitmethod "meet", the image would be ratio-scaled to be
completely visible. Other methods are "clip" and "slice".

Multiple options can be used at the same time by simply concatenating them
using a space. By the way, most pdf functions work exactly the same as the
PDFlib functions. So just risk a look into the PFLlib documentations (use a
search engine).

Hope this helped! Best regards - Adrian

===============================================================================

By using imap_fetchbody() you may run in trouble by using too much memory.
Using imap_savebody() may prevent this.

But the content will be encoded, in other words it is useless. Adding a filter
can help here.

<?php
$whandle = fopen('./incomming/tmp.tif','w');

stream_filter_append($whandle,
   'convert.base64-decode',STREAM_FILTER_WRITE);

imap_savebody ($mbox, $whandle, $i, $partcounter++);

fclose($whandle);
?>

NOTE: To find the proper filter you need to check the encoding given by the
structure of the body.
===============================================================================

This function will save ALL information from the email if the part number is
left out. Pretty handy for archiving.

It seems that imap_savebody saves attachments with special characters above
ascii 127 as quoted printable.
But if you need it in utf8, you may use the imap_qprint function after the
attachment is saved:

<?php
$tFile = "/path/to/attachment";
$tFileOutput="";
$tFileHandle = fopen($tFile, "r");

//get the content of the file into a string
while(!feof($tFileHandle))
  $tFileOutput = $tFileOutput . fgets($tFileHandle, 4096);

fclose ($tFileHandle);
           
$tFileHandle = fopen($tFile, "w");
//write the new 8Bit string to the file
fwrite($tFileHandle, imap_qprint($tFileOutput));
fclose ($tFileHandle);
?>

I tried to use this function. But it seems it requires php_zip.dll to be
load..  i got the php errror like below.

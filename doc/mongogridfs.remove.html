MongoGridFS::remove — Remove files and their chunks from the database

说明

public bool|array MongoGridFS::remove ([ array $criteria = array() [, array
$options = array() ]] )

参数

criteria

    The filename or criteria for which to search.

options

    An array of options for the remove operations executed against the chunks
    and files collections. See MongoCollection::remove() for documentation on
    these options.

返回值

Returns an array containing the status of the removal (with respect to the
files collection) if the "w" option is set. Otherwise, returns TRUE.

Fields in the status array are described in the documentation for 
MongoCollection::insert().

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if the "w" option is set and the write fails.

Throws MongoCursorTimeoutException if the "w" option is set to a value greater
than one and the operation takes longer than MongoCursor::$timeout milliseconds
to complete. This does not kill the operation on the server, it is a
client-side timeout. The operation in MongoCollection::$wtimeout is
milliseconds.

===============================================================================

To ensure that a remove occurred successfully use MongoDB::lastError().
Currently MongoGridFS::remove will return even if the remove failed.

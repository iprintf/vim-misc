getcwd

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

getcwd — 取得当前工作目录

说明

string getcwd ( void )

取得当前工作目录。

返回值

成功则返回当前工作目录，失败返回 FALSE。

在某些 Unix 的变种下，如果任何父目录没有设定可读或搜索模式，即使当前目录设定了
，getcwd() 还是会返回 FALSE。有关模式与权限的更多信息见 chmod()。

范例

Example #1 getcwd() 例子

<?php

// current directory
echo getcwd() . "\n";

chdir('cvs');

// current directory
echo getcwd() . "\n";

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

/home/didou
/home/didou/cvs

getcwd() returns the path of the "main" script referenced in the URL.

dirname(__FILE__) will return the path of the script currently executing.

I had written a script that required several class definition scripts from the
same directory. It retrieved them based on filename matches and used getcwd to
figure out where they were.

Didn't work so well when I needed to call that first script from a new file in
a different directory.
===============================================================================

It appears there is a change in functionality in PHP5 from PHP4 when using the
CLI tool.  Here is the example: -

cd /tmp

cat > foo.php << END
<?php
    print getcwd() . "\n";
?>
END

cd /

php -q /tmp/foo.php

PHP4 returns /tmp
PHP5 returns /

Something to be aware of.
===============================================================================

Take care if you use getcwd() in file that you'll need to include (using
include, require, or *_once) in a script located outside of the same directory
tree.

example:
<?php
//in /var/www/main_document_root/include/MySQL.inc.php
if (strpos(getcwd(),'main_')>0) {
  //code to set up main DB connection
}
?>

<?php
//in home/cron_user/maintenance_scripts/some_maintenance_script.php
require_once ('/var/www/main_document_root/include/MySQL.inc.php');
?>

In the above example, the database connection will not be made because the call
to getcwd() returns the path relative to the calling script ( /home/cron_user/
maintenance_scripts ) NOT relative to the file where the getcwd() function is
called.
===============================================================================

If you try to use getcwd() in a directory that is a symbolic link, getcwd()
gives you the target of that link (similarly when parent etc. is symbolic
link). There might be a better solution, but this worked for me (linux):
<? php
$cwd = exec('pwd');
?>
===============================================================================

if you link your php to /bin/linkedphp  and your php is at for ex /home/
actual.php

when you run linkedphp in somewhere in your filesystem,
getcwd returns /bin instead of working dir,

solution: use dirname(__FILENAME__) instead
===============================================================================

As you could read in
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.differences.php
the CLI SAPI does - contrary to other SAPIs - NOT automatically change the
current working directory to the one the started script resides in.

A very simple workaround to regain the behaviour you're used to from your
"ordinary" webpage scripting is to include something like that at the beginning
of your script:

<?php
  chdir( dirname ( __FILE__ ) );
?>

But because this is about reading or "finding" pathes, you might appreciate it
if I share some more sophisticated tricks I frequently use in CLI scripts ...

<?php
// Note: all pathes stored in subsequent Variables end up with a
DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR

// how to store the working directory "from where" the script was called:
$initial_cwd = preg_replace( '~(\w)$~' , '$1' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , realpath(
getcwd() ) );

// how to switch symlink-free to the folder the current file resides in:
chdir( dirname ( realpath ( __FILE__ ) ) );

// how to store the former folder in a variable:
$my_folder = dirname( realpath( __FILE__ ) ) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;

// how to get a path one folder up if $my_folder ends with \class\ or /class/ :
$my_parent_folder = preg_replace( '~[/\\\\]class[/\\\\]$~' , 
DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , $my_folder );

// how to get a path one folder up in any case :
$my_parent_folder = preg_replace( '~[/\\\\][^/\\\\]*[/\\\\]$~' , 
DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , $my_folder );

// how to make an array of OS-style-pathes from an array of unix-style-pathes
// (handy if you use config-files or so):
foreach( $unix_style_pathes as $unix_style_path )
    $os_independent_path[] = str_replace( '/' , DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , 
$unix_style_path );

?>
===============================================================================

Some server's has security options to block the getcwd()

Alternate option:

str_replace($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'],'', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
===============================================================================

This function is often used in conjuction with basename(), i.e.
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.basename.php
===============================================================================

In response to myself: that function will not work for cases like:
/usr/bin$: /home/johndoe/Work/script.php
So here's a better and simpler way (I think this one works for all cases)
<?php
function get_file_dir() {
    global $argv;
    return realpath($argv[0]);
}
?>
Knock yourself out :)
===============================================================================

When running PHP on the command line, if you want to include another file which
is in the same directory as the main script, doing just
<?php
include './otherfile.php';
?>
might not work, if you run your script like this:
/$ /path/to/script.php
because the current working dir will be set to '/', and the file '/
otherfile.php' does not exist, because it is in '/path/to/otherfile.php'.
So, to get the directory in which the script resides, you can use this
function:
<?php
function get_file_dir() {
    global $argv;
    $dir = dirname(getcwd() . '/' . $argv[0]);
    $curDir = getcwd();
    chdir($dir);
    $dir = getcwd();
    chdir($curDir);
    return $dir;
}
?>
So you can use it like this:
<?php
include get_file_dir() . '/otherfile.php';
// or even..
chdir(get_file_dir());
include './otherfile.php';
?>
Spent some time thinking this one out, maybe it helps someone :)
===============================================================================

This is a function to convert a path which looks something like this:

/home/www/somefolder/../someotherfolder/../

To a proper directory path:

<?php

function simplify_path($path) {

//saves our current working directory to a variable
$oldcwd = getcwd();
//changes the directory to the one to convert
//$path is the directory to convert (clean up), handed over to the //function
as a string

chdir($path);
return gstr_replace('\\', '/', getcwd());

//change the cwd back to the old value to not interfere with the script
chdir($oldcwd);

}

This function is really useful if you want to compare two filepaths which are
not necesarily in a "cleaned up" state. It works in *NIX and WINDOWS alike

?>
===============================================================================

I use this code to replicate the pushd and popd DOS commands in PHP:

<?php
$g_DirStack = array();
function pushd( $dir )
{
    global $g_DirStack;
    array_push( $g_DirStack, getcwd() );
    chdir( $dir );
}
function popd( )
{
    global $g_DirStack;
    $dir = array_pop( $g_DirStack );
    assert( $dir !== null );
    chdir( $dir );
}
?>

This allows you to change the current directory with pushd, then use popd to
"undo" the directory change when you're done.
===============================================================================

"On some Unix variants, getcwd() will return FALSE if any one of the parent
directories does not have the readable or search mode set, even if the current
directory does."

Just so you know, MacOS X is one of these variants (at least 10.4 is for me).
You can make it work by applying 'chmod a+rx' to all folders from your site
folder upwards.
===============================================================================

If getcwd() returns nothing for you under Solaris with an NFS mounted
subdirectory, you are running into an OS bug that is supposedly fixed in recent
versions of Solaris 10.  This same OS bug effects the include() and require()
functions as well.
===============================================================================

watch out:
working directory, and thus:
getcwd ()
is "/" while being into a register'ed shutdown function!!!
===============================================================================

To get the username of the account:

<?php
$dir = getcwd();
$part = explode('/', $dir);
$username = $part[1];
?>

If current directory is '/home/mike/public_html/' it would return mike.
===============================================================================

Be aware when calling getcwd() in directories consisting of symlinks.

getcwd()  is the equivalent of shell command "pwd -P" which resolves symlinks.

The shell command "pwd" is the equivalent of "pwd -L" which uses PWD from the
environment without resolving symlinks. This is also the equivalent of calling
getenv('PWD').
===============================================================================

If your PHP cli binary is built as a cgi binary (check with php_sapi_name), the
cwd functions differently than you might expect.

say you have a script /usr/local/bin/purge
you are in /home/username

php CLI: getcwd() gives you /home/username
php CGI: getcwd() gives you /usr/local/bin

This can trip you up if you're writing command line scripts with php. You can
override the CGI behavior by adding -C to the php call:

#!/usr/local/bin/php -Cq

and then getcwd() behaves as it does in the CLI-compiled version.

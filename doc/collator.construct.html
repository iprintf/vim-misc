Collator::__construct — Create a collator

说明

public Collator::__construct ( string $locale )

Creates a new instance of Collator.

参数

locale

    The locale whose collation rules should be used. Special values for locales
    can be passed in - if null is passed for the locale, the default locale's
    collation rules will be used. If "root" is passed, UCA rules will be used.

    The Locale attribute is typically the most important attribute for correct
    sorting and matching, according to the user expectations in different
    countries and regions. The default » UCA ordering will only sort a few
    languages such as Dutch and Portuguese correctly ("correctly" meaning
    according to the normal expectations for users of the languages).
    Otherwise, you need to supply the locale to UCA in order to properly
    collate text for a given language. Thus a locale needs to be supplied so as
    to choose a collator that is correctly tailored for that locale. The choice
    of a locale will automatically preset the values for all of the attributes
    to something that is reasonable for that locale. Thus most of the time the
    other attributes do not need to be explicitly set. In some cases, the
    choice of locale will make a difference in string comparison performance
    and/or sort key length.

返回值

Returns Collator instance.

错误／异常

Returns an "empty" object on error. You can use intl_get_error_code() and/or 
intl_get_error_message() to know what happened.

The MongoWriteBatch class

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

Introduction

MongoWriteBatch is the base class for the MongoInsertBatch, MongoUpdateBatch
and MongoDeleteBatch classes.

MongoWriteBatch allows you to "batch up" multiple operations (of same type) and
shipping them all to MongoDB at the same time. This can be especially useful
when operating on many documents at the same time to reduce roundtrips.

Prior to version 1.5.0 of the driver it was possible to use 
MongoCollection::batchInsert(), however, as of 1.5.0 that method is now
discouraged.

Note: This class is only available when talking to MongoDB 2.6.0 (and later)
servers. It will throw MongoProtocolException if attempting to use it on older
MongoDB servers.

Class synopsis

MongoWriteBatch {
/* Constants */
const int COMMAND_INSERT = 1 ;
const int COMMAND_UPDATE = 2 ;
const int COMMAND_DELETE = 3 ;
/* Methods */
protected __construct ( MongoCollection $collection [, string $batch_type [, 
array $write_options ]] )
public bool add ( array $item )
final public array execute ( array $write_options )
}

MongoWriteBatch types

MongoWriteBatch::COMMAND_INSERT

    Create an Insert Write Batch

MongoWriteBatch::COMMAND_UPDATE

    Create an Update Write Batch

MongoWriteBatch::COMMAND_DELETE

    Create an Delete Write Batch

Description

When executing a batch, by calling MongoWriteBatch::execute(), MongoWriteBatch
will send over » maxWriteBatchSize (defaults to 1000) documents or up to
» maxBsonObjectSize (defaults to 16777216 bytes), whichever comes first.

    Note:

    Documents will never be partially transferred. When adding documents to the
    batch, that overflows the limit, a new batch will be created and the
    document put into the new batch.

Errors/Exceptions

  • Exception on parameter parsing failures
  • Exception on argument validation errors (e.g. missing keys)
  • MongoProtocolException when talking to MongoDB server older then 2.6.0.
  • MongoProtocolException on socket errors.
  • MongoWriteConcernException when a write fails due to WriteConcerns

Examples

Example #1 MongoWriteBatch example

Adding documents to a Insert batch and then execute it

<?php
$mc = new MongoClient("localhost");

$collection = $mc->selectCollection("test", "test");


$docs = array();
$docs[] = array("my" => "demo");
$docs[] = array("is" => "working");
$docs[] = array("pretty" => "well");

$batch = new MongoInsertBatch($collection);
foreach($docs as $document) {
    $batch->add($document);
}
$retval = $batch->execute(array("w" => 1));
var_dump($retval);
?>

The above example will output:

array(2) {
  ["nInserted"]=>
  int(3)
  ["ok"]=>
  bool(true)
}

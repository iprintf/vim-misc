ps_rect — Draws a rectangle

说明

bool ps_rect ( resource $psdoc , float $x , float $y , float $width , float
$height )

Draws a rectangle with its lower left corner at (x, y). The rectangle starts
and ends in its lower left corner. If this function is called outside a path it
will start a new path. If it is called within a path it will add the rectangle
as a subpath. If the last drawing operation does not end in the lower left
corner then there will be a gap in the path.

x

    x-coordinate of the lower left corner of the rectangle.

y

    y-coordinate of the lower left corner of the rectangle.

width

    The width of the image.

height

    The height of the image.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

(PECL win32service SVN)

win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher — Registers the script with the SCM, so
that it can act as the service with the given name

说明

mixed win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher ( string $name )

When launched via the Service Control Manager, a service process is required to
"check-in" with it to establish service monitoring and communication
facilities. This function performs the check-in by spawning a thread to handle
the lower-level communication with the service control manager.

Once started, the service process should do 2 things. The first is to tell the
Service Control Manager that the service is running. This is achieved by
calling win32_set_service_status() with the WIN32_SERVICE_RUNNING constant. If
you need to perform some lengthy process before the service is actually
running, then you can use the WIN32_SERVICE_START_PENDING constant. The second
is to continue to check-in with the service control manager so that it can
determine if it should terminate. This is achieved by periodically calling 
win32_get_last_control_message() and handling the return code appropriately.

参数

name

    The short-name of the service, as registered by win32_create_service().

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，参数错误时返回 FALSE，或失败时返回一个 Win32 错误码。

范例

Example #1 A win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher() example

Check if the service is runnig under the SCM.

<?php
if (!win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher('dummyphp')) {
  die("I'm probably not running under the service control manager");
}

win32_set_service_status(WIN32_SERVICE_START_PENDING);

// Some lengthy process to get this service up and running.

win32_set_service_status(WIN32_SERVICE_RUNNING);

while (WIN32_SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP != win32_get_last_control_message()) {
  # do some work here, trying not to take more than around 30 seconds
  # before coming back into the loop again
}
?>

Don't try to call "win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher" too late in your code.
You'd trigger a #2186 error : "The service is not responding to the control
function." (from commande line) or a #1053 error : "The service did not respond
to the start or control request in a timely fashion." (from services GUI).

Try not to load a bunch of PEAR classes before to register php script as
Service like I did.

Another good hint, to get a verbose version of the return code, you can call
"NET HELPMSG ###" from command line where ### is your error code.

The MongoDB\Driver\Cursor class

(mongodb >=1.0.0)

简介

The MongoDB\Driver\Cursor class encapsulates the results of a MongoDB command
or query and may be returned by MongoDB\Driver\Manager::executeCommand() or 
MongoDB\Driver\Manager::executeQuery(), respectively.

===============================================================================

As one might notice, this class does not implement a hasNext() or next() method
as opposed to the now deprecated Mongo driver.

If, for any reason, you need to pull data from the cursor procedurally or
otherwise need to override the behavior of foreach while iterating on the
cursor, the SPL \IteratorIterator class can be used. When doing so, it is
important to rewind the iterator before using it, otherwise you won't get any
data back.

<?php
$cursor = $collection->find();
$it = new \IteratorIterator($cursor);
$it->rewind(); // Very important

while($doc = $it->current()) {
    var_dump($doc);
    $it->next();
}
?>

I used this trick to build a backward compatibility wrapper emulating the old
Mongo driver in order to upgrade an older codebase.
===============================================================================

I noticed that  ->sort is missing from the cursor.  Seems like the old driver
has more functionality.

[red.: The way how cursors are created is different between the drivers. In the
old driver, the cursor would not be created until after the first rewind() call
on the iterator.

In the new driver the cursor already exists. Because sort (and limit and skip)
parameters need to be send to the server, they can not be called after the
cursor already has been created.

You can use sort (and limit and skip) with the new driver as well, by
specifying them as options to the Query as shown in this example: http://

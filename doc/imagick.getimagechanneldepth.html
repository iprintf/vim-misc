(PECL imagick 2.0.0)

Imagick::getImageChannelDepth — Gets the depth for a particular image channel

说明

int Imagick::getImageChannelDepth ( int $channel )

Gets the depth for a particular image channel.

参数

    Provide any channel constant that is valid for your channel mode. To apply
    to more than one channel, combine channel constants using bitwise
    operators. 缺省为Imagick::CHANNEL_DEFAULT. 参考此通道常数列表

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE。

For undocumented functions, this is a particular oddity.  For me, this function
has so far returned only two values for any particular image: 1 and 8.  And,
after experimenting with it about forty or fifty times, I think I understand
how it works, based simply on my experience.

The value returned is the number of bits used for the particular color channel
within an image.  That means how variable a particular color is within an
image.  While I received 1 and 8, it could theoretically be as much as 16 or
32, depending on how the technology evolves over, say, the next decade or so.

To best understand this function, you should probably also understand the
ImageMagick function getColorValue.  In terms of the ImageMagick class, a color
can be measured between 0 and 1, in terms in of a particular pixel.  Red,
Green, Blue, or, any particular color of any color scheme, can be something
like 0.501960784314.  But, since each pixel is a combination of the three
colors, you can have 0.845 for red, 0.254 for green, and 0.11 for blue.

How does this all tie in with the getChannelDepth function?  Easy.  If all of
the pixels in an image are either values 1 or values 0 for the particular Red/
Green/Blue values, then this function will return a 1 for 1 bits per pixel for
that color channel.  If, however, any single pixel in the image for the
inputted channel parameter isn't exactly 1 or 0 for the particular color
channel, then this function will return an 8 for 8-bit colors per pixel for
that color channel.

If you receive back a 1 for every single color channel put in the parameter,
that means you're dealing with an image that's 16-bit -- you know, like those
computer games published in 1982, or the Atari console games.  You won't ever
forget a 16-bit color green, trust me.  If you get back an 8 for every single
color channel put in the parameter, that means you're dealing with any
standard, modern image.

You can input any color channel, based on the channel constants available
within the ImageMagick class.  See them here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/
imagick.constants.php#imagick.constants.channel .  That means a format like
imagick::CHANNEL_UNDEFINED, but with the "_UNDEFINED" value being anything
here: undefined, red, gray, cyan, green, magenta, blue, yellow, alpha, opacity,
matte, black, index, all, and default.

For any image with one pixel color of RGB value 1 / 0.501960784314 /
0.501960784314 (#FF8080), you get this result:

Channel - 'Undefined' :        1
Channel - 'Red' :     1
Channel - 'Gray' :     1
Channel - 'Cyan' :     1
Channel - 'Green' :     8
Channel - 'Magenta' :     8
Channel - 'Blue' :     8
Channel - 'Yellow' :     8
Channel - 'Alpha' :     1
Channel - 'Opacity' :     1
Channel - 'Matte' :     1
Channel - 'Black' :     1
Channel - 'Index' :     1
Channel - 'All' :     8
Channel - 'Default' :     8

If all colors are between 0 and 1 with getColorValue function, each of these
results with be 1.  If you're dealing with an image that has full color
spectrum depth (almost any given photograph), you'll get 8 for red, gray, cyan,
green, magenta, blue, yellow, all, and default, with a 1 for the other
remaining channels.  Perhaps some use for automated image editing, like use
with posterize or oilpaint functions.

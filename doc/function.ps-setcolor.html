ps_setcolor — Sets current color

说明

bool ps_setcolor ( resource $psdoc , string $type , string $colorspace , float
$c1 , float $c2 , float $c3 , float $c4 )

Sets the color for drawing, filling, or both.

参数

psdoc

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by ps_new().

type

    The parameter type can be both, fill, or fillstroke.

colorspace

    The colorspace should be one of gray, rgb, cmyk, spot, pattern. Depending
    on the colorspace either only the first, the first three or all parameters
    will be used.

c1

    Depending on the colorspace this is either the red component (rgb), the
    cyan component (cmyk), the gray value (gray), the identifier of the spot
    color or the identifier of the pattern.

c2

    Depending on the colorspace this is either the green component (rgb), the
    magenta component (cmyk).

c3

    Depending on the colorspace this is either the blue component (rgb), the
    yellow component (cmyk).

c4

    This must only be set in cmyk colorspace and specifies the black component.

Bugs

The second parameter is currently not always evaluated. The color is sometimes
set for filling and drawing just as if fillstroke were passed.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。


User Contributed Notes 1 note

===============================================================================

Note that if you specify colors in RGB, the parameters C1, C2, and C3 should be
specified in decimal form.  To calculate this, divide the value by 255. 
Example: rgb(58,110,165) becomes <?php ps_setcolor($ps, "stroke", "rgb", .23, 
.43, .65, 0.0); ?>

However, since this is PostScript, most if not all files will be destined for
printing and colors should be specified in CMYK anyway.

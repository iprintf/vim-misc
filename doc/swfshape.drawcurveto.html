中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

swfshape::drawcurveto() draws a quadratic curve (using the current line style,
set by swfshape::setline()) from the current pen position to (anchorx,anchory)
using (controlx,controly) as a control point. That is, head towards the control
point, then smoothly turn to the anchor point.

With 6 parameters, it draws a cubic bezier to point (targetx, targety) with
control points (controlx, controly) and (anchorx, anchory).

===============================================================================

for those new this all this, "anchor" is where you want to end up and "control"
is the point you would go to if you were drawing a square.

for example, this would draw a quarter circle
<?php
    $s->movePenTo(100, 100);
    $s->drawLineTo(200, 100);
    $s->drawCurveTo(200, 200, 100, 200);
    $s->drawLineTo(100, 100);
?>

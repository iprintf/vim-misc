EventBufferEvent::free — Free a buffer event

说明

public void EventBufferEvent::free ( void )

Free resources allocated by buffer event.

Usually there is no need to call this method, since normally it is done within
internal object destructors. However, sometimes we have a long-time script
allocating lots of instances, or a script with a heavy memory usage, where we
need to free resources as soon as possible. In such cases 
EventBufferEvent::free() may be used to protect the script against running up
to the memory_limit .

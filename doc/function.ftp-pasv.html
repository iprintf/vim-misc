ftp_pasv

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ftp_pasv — 返回当前 FTP 被动模式是否打开

说明

bool ftp_pasv ( resource $ftp_stream , bool $pasv )

在被动模式打开的情况下，数据的传送由客户机启动，而不是由服务器开始。

请注意 ftp_pasv() 只能在 FTP 登录成功后方可调用，否则会失败。

参数

ftp_stream

    FTP 连接资源。

pasv

    如果参数 pasv 为 TRUE，打开被动模式传输 (PASV MODE) ，否则则关闭被动传输模
    式。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 ftp_pasv() 实例

<?php
$file = 'somefile.txt';
$remote_file = 'readme.txt';

// set up basic connection
$conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server);

// login with username and password
$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);

// turn passive mode on
ftp_pasv($conn_id, true);

// upload a file
if (ftp_put($conn_id, $remote_file, $file, FTP_ASCII)) {
 echo "successfully uploaded $file\n";
} else {
 echo "There was a problem while uploading $file\n";
}

// close the connection
ftp_close($conn_id);
?>

===============================================================================

If you are still having problems after choosing ftp_pasv() you should refresh
the connection through ftp_close() / ftp_connect() after x files and/or y GB
have been transfered.

It solved several (random) occurring problems like:

ftp_get(): Opening BINARY mode data connection

ftp_get(): Entering Passive Mode

Hint: fopen() created a file so don't forget to delete it if an error occurred
;)
===============================================================================

It should be noted that ftp_pasv has to be called AFTER ftp_login (not after
ftp_connect). May seem obvious to many but it took me three hours to find
out...
===============================================================================

I found one place that required passive mode to function properly, but the
initial error manifested itself in an odd way:

PHP Warning:  ftp_put(): TYPE is now ASCII in <file.php> on line <#>

or

PHP Warning:  ftp_put(): TYPE is now 8 BIT BINARY in <file.php> on line <#>

The other symptom is that it was taking a long time, perhaps the 90 seconds
that the timeout was set to. No errors occurred upon connect, just when I tried
ftp_put().

Once I turned on ftp_pasv() it worked, both in the place where active mode
worked, and on the server where active mode wouldn't work.
===============================================================================

If you are running filezilla in passive mode, on windows, and try to connect
using PHP, you might encounter an error that reads "425 Can't open data
connection for transfer of ..."
This error is not indicative of a passive mode issue, but can be resolved by
using
<?php
ftp_pasv($conn, true);
?>
===============================================================================

If you find that you are receiving "Illegal PORT command" errors you may want
to try enabling passive mode.
===============================================================================

Directly from bsd FTP manual pages:

The PASV command requests that the remote server open a port for the data
connection and return the address of that port.  The remote server listens on
that port and the client connects to it.

                 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client
listens on a port and sends that address to the remote server, who connects
back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using ftp through a gateway router or
host that controls the directionality of traffic.  (Note that though ftp
servers are required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)
===============================================================================

PASV: For ftp users behind firewall, the server LISTEN for a connection.

Non-PASV: The client LISTEN for a connection from server.

The Normalizer class

(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0, PHP 7, PECL intl >= 1.0.0)

简介

Normalization is a process that involves transforming characters and sequences
of characters into a formally-defined underlying representation. This process
is most important when text needs to be compared for sorting and searching, but
it is also used when storing text to ensure that the text is stored in a
consistent representation.

The Unicode Consortium has defined a number of normalization forms reflecting
the various needs of applications:

  • Normalization Form D (NFD) - Canonical Decomposition
  • Normalization Form C (NFC) - Canonical Decomposition followed by Canonical
    Composition
  • Normalization Form KD (NFKD) - Compatibility Decomposition
  • Normalization Form KC (NFKC) - Compatibility Decomposition followed by
    Canonical Composition

The different forms are defined in terms of a set of transformations on the
text, transformations that are expressed by both an algorithm and a set of data
files.

类摘要

Normalizer {
/* 方法 */
public static bool isNormalized ( string $input [, int $form =
Normalizer::FORM_C ] )
public static string normalize ( string $input [, int $form =
Normalizer::FORM_C ] )
}

预定义常量

The following constants define the normalization form used by the normalizer:

Normalizer::FORM_C (integer)
    Normalization Form C (NFC) - Canonical Decomposition followed by Canonical
    Composition
Normalizer::FORM_D (integer)
    Normalization Form D (NFD) - Canonical Decomposition
Normalizer::FORM_KC (integer)
    Normalization Form KC (NFKC) - Compatibility Decomposition, followed by
    Canonical Composition
Normalizer::FORM_KD (integer)
    Normalization Form KD (NFKD) - Compatibility Decomposition
Normalizer::NONE (integer)
    No decomposition/composition
Normalizer::OPTION_DEFAULT (integer)
    Default normalization options

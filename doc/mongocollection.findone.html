MongoCollection::findOne

(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

MongoCollection::findOne — Queries this collection, returning a single element

说明

public array MongoCollection::findOne ([ array $query = array() [, array
$fields = array() [, array $options = array() ]]] )

As opposed to MongoCollection::find(), this method will return only the first
result from the result set, and not a MongoCursor that can be iterated over.

参数

query

    The fields for which to search. MongoDB's query language is quite
    extensive. The PHP driver will in almost all cases pass the query straight
    through to the server, so reading the MongoDB core docs on » find is a good
    idea.

    Warning

    Please make sure that for all special query operaters (starting with $) you
    use single quotes so that PHP doesn't try to replace "$exists" with the
    value of the variable $exists.

fields

    Fields of the results to return. The array is in the format array
    ('fieldname' => true, 'fieldname2' => true). The _id field is always
    returned.

options

    This parameter is an associative array of the form array("name" => <value>,
    ...). Currently supported options are:

      □ "maxTimeMS"

        Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing the
        operation on the server (does not include idle time). If the operation
        is not completed by the server within the timeout period, a
        MongoExecutionTimeoutException will be thrown.

返回值

Returns record matching the search or NULL.

错误／异常

Throws MongoConnectionException if it cannot reach the database.

更新日志

版本                说明
1.5.0 Added optional options argument.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::findOne() document by its id.

This example demonstrates how to find a single document in a collection by its
id.

<?php

$articles = $mongo->my_db->articles;

$article = $articles->findOne(array('_id' => new MongoId(
'47cc67093475061e3d9536d2')));

?>

Example #2 MongoCollection::findOne() document by some condition.

This example demonstrates how to find a single document in a collection by some
condition and limiting the returned fields.

<?php

$users = $mongo->my_db->users;
$user = $users->findOne(array('username' => 'jwage'), array('password'));
print_r($user);

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [_id] => MongoId Object
        (
        )

    [password] => test
)

Notice how even though the document does have a username field, we limited the
results to only contain the password field.

===============================================================================

There is also a notation to retrieve all fields, but the specified ones

<?php

$users = $mongo->my_db->users;
$user = $users->findOne(array('username' => 'jwage'), array('password' => 0));
print_r($user);

?>

Will return all fields of the user, but the password field.

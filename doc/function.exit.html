exit

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

exit — 输出一个消息并且退出当前脚本

说明

void exit ([ string $status ] )
void exit ( int $status )

中止脚本的执行。尽管调用了 exit()， Shutdown函数以及 object destructors 总是会
被执行。

参数

status

    如果 status 是一个字符串，在退出之前该函数会打印 status 。

    如果 status 是一个 integer，该值会作为退出状态码，并且不会被打印输出。退出
    状态码应该在范围0至254，不应使用被PHP保留的退出状态码255。状态码0用于成功中
    止程序。

        Note: PHP >= 4.2.0 当 status 是一个 integer，不会打印输出。

返回值

没有返回值。

范例

Example #1 exit() 例子

<?php

$filename = '/path/to/data-file';
$file = fopen($filename, 'r')
    or exit("unable to open file ($filename)");

?>

Example #2 exit() 状态码例子

<?php

//exit program normally
exit;
exit();
exit(0);

//exit with an error code
exit(1);
exit(0376); //octal

?>

Example #3 无论如何，Shutdown函数与析构函数都会被执行

<?php
class Foo
{
    public function __destruct()
    {
        echo 'Destruct: ' . __METHOD__ . '()' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}

function shutdown()
{
    echo 'Shutdown: ' . __FUNCTION__ . '()' . PHP_EOL;
}

$foo = new Foo();
register_shutdown_function('shutdown');

exit();
echo 'This will not be output.';
?>

以上例程会输出：

 Shutdown: shutdown()
 Destruct: Foo::__destruct()


注释

    Note: 因为是一个语言构造器而不是一个函数，不能被可变函数调用。

    Note:

    该语法结构等同于 die()。

Don't use the  exit() function in the auto prepend file with fastcgi (linux/bsd
os).
It has the effect of leaving opened files with for result at least a nice  "Too
many open files  ..." error.
===============================================================================

If you want to avoid calling exit() in FastCGI as per the comments below, but
really, positively want to exit cleanly from nested function call or include,
consider doing it the Python way:

define an exception named `SystemExit', throw it instead of calling exit() and
catch it in index.php with an empty handler to finish script execution cleanly.

<?php

// file: index.php
class SystemExit extends Exception {}
try {
   /* code code */
}
catch (SystemExit $e) { /* do nothing */ }
// end of file: index.php

// some deeply nested function or .php file   

if (SOME_EXIT_CONDITION)
   throw new SystemExit(); // instead of exit()

?>

To rich dot lovely at klikzltd dot co dot uk:

Using a "@" before header() to suppress its error, and relying on the "headers
already sent" error seems to me a very bad idea while building any serious
website.

This is *not* a clean way to prevent a file from being called directly. At
least this is not a secure method, as you rely on the presence of an exception
sent by the parser at runtime.

I recommend using a more common way as defining a constant or assigning a
variable with any value, and checking for its presence in the included script,
like:

in index.php:
<?php
define ('INDEX', true);
?>

in your included file:
<?php
if (!defined('INDEX')) {
   die('You cannot call this script directly !');
}
?>

BR.

===============================================================================

jbezorg at gmail proposed the following:

<?php

if($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] == __FILE__ )
  header('Location: /');

?>

After sending the `Location:' header PHP _will_ continue parsing, and all code
below the header() call will still be executed.  So instead use:

<?php

if($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] == __FILE__)
{
  header('Location: /');
  exit;
}

?>
===============================================================================

Calling to exit() will flush all buffers started by ob_start() to default
output.
===============================================================================

When using php-fpm, fastcgi_finish_request() should be used instead of
register_shutdown_function() and exit()

For example, under nginx and php-fpm 5.3+, this will make browsers wait 10
seconds to show output:

<?php
    echo "You have to wait 10 seconds to see this.<br>";
    register_shutdown_function('shutdown');
    exit;
    function shutdown(){
        sleep(10);
        echo "Because exit() doesn't terminate php-fpm calls immediately.<br>";
    }
?>

This doesn't:

<?php
    echo "You can see this from the browser immediately.<br>";
    fastcgi_finish_request();
    sleep(10);
    echo "You can't see this form the browser.";
?>
===============================================================================

If you are using templates with numerous includes then exit() will end you
script and your template will not complete (no </table>, </body>, </html>
etc...).  Rather than having complex nested conditional logic within your
content, just create a "footer.php" file that closes all of your HTML and if
you want to exit out of a script just include() the footer before you exit().

for example:

include ('header.php');
blah blah blah
if (!$mysql_connect) {
echo "unable to connect";
include ('footer.php');
exit;
}
blah blah blah
include ('footer.php');
===============================================================================

In addition to "void a t informance d o t info", here's a one-liner that
requires no constant:

<?php basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) == basename(__FILE__) && die('Thou shall
not pass!'); ?>

Placing it at the beginning of a PHP file will prevent direct access to the
script.

To redirect to / instead of dying:

<?php
if (basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) == basename(__FILE__)) {
    if (ob_get_contents()) ob_clean(); // ob_get_contents() even works without
active output buffering
    header('Location: /');
    die;
}
?>

Doing the same in a one-liner:

<?php basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) == basename(__FILE__) && (!ob_get_contents
() || ob_clean()) && header('Location: /') && die; ?>

A note to security: Even though $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] comes from the user, it's
safe to assume its validity, as the "manipulation" takes place _before_ the
actual file execution, meaning that the string _must_ have been valid enough to
execute the file. Also, basename() is binary safe, so you can safely rely on
this function.

Note, that using exit() will explicitly cause Roxen webserver to die, if PHP is
used as Roxen SAPI module. There is no known workaround for that, except not to
use exit(). CGI versions of PHP are not affected.
===============================================================================

return may be preferable to exit in certain situations, especially when dealing
with the PHP binary and the shell.

I have a script which is the recipient of a mail alias, i.e. mail sent to that
alias is piped to the script instead of being delivered to a mailbox. Using
exit in this script resulted in the sender of the email getting a delivery
failure notice. This was not the desired behavior, I wanted to silently discard
messages which did not satisfy the script's requirements.

After several hours of trying to figure out what integer value I should pass to
exit() to satisfy sendmail, I tried using return instead of exit. Worked like a
charm. Sendmail didn't like exit but it was perfectly happy with return. So, if
you're running into trouble with exit and other system binaries, try using
return instead.
===============================================================================

In PHP 4.3.1 (and possibly 4.3.0), running scripts from the command line works
a lot better.  This is probably because 4.3.x has a whole new CLI mode.

Specifically, exit status is now returned (to the shell) as you would expect. 
This is a godsend for writing embedded email processing scripts, as much email
infrastructure (fetchmail, qmail, mutt, etc.) is dependant upon correctly
returned status codes, and the inability to return a status code (as in PHP
4.2.x) is an insurmountable obstacle.

$_SERVER["argv"] is also always available in 4.3.x, I think, whereas in 4.2.x
php.ini could prevent it from being available.

(On the downside, I had to ./configure --without-mysql in order to get 4.3.1 to
compile on RedHat 8.0.  Otherwise there was what looked like a fatal compile
warning (that I might also have been able to ignore somehow).

The "fatal warning" FYI:
ext/mysql/libmysql/my_tempnam.o: In function `my_tempnam':
ext/mysql/libmysql/my_tempnam.c:103: the use of `tempnam' is dangerous, better
use `mkstemp'

Changing the code from tempnam to mkstemp would probably not be overly
complicated, but it is non-trivial.)

<?php

class Foo
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        register_shutdown_function([$this, 'shutdown']);
    }

    public function __destruct()
    {
        echo 'Destruct: ' . __METHOD__ . '()' . PHP_EOL;
    }

    function shutdown()
    {
        echo 'Shutdown: ' . __FUNCTION__ . '()' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();
exit();

// output is
//Shutdown: shutdown()
//Destruct: Foo::__destruct()
===============================================================================

A side-note for the use of exit with finally: if you exit somewhere in a try
block, the finally won't be executed. Could not sound obvious: for instance in
Java you never issue an exit, at least a return in your controller; in PHP
instead you could find yourself exiting from a controller method (e.g. in case
you issue a redirect).

Here follows the POC:

<?php
echo "testing finally wit exit\n";

try {
    echo "In try, exiting\n";

    exit;
} catch(Exception $e) {
    echo "catched\n";
} finally {
    echo "in finally\n";
}

echo "In the end\n";
?>

This will print:

testing finally wit exit
In try, exiting
===============================================================================

It should be noted that if building a site that runs on FastCGI, calling exit
will generate an error in the server's log file. This can quickly fill up.

Also, using exit will diminish the performance benefit gained on FastCGI
setups. Instead, consider using code like this:

<?php

if( /* error case */ )
    echo "Invalid request";
else {
    /* The rest of your application */
}
?>

I've also seen developers get around this issue with FastCGI by wrapping their
code in a switch statement and using breaks:

index.php:
<?php

switch(true) {
    case true:
        require('application.php');
}

?>

application.php:
<?php

if($x > $y) {
    echo "Sorry, that didn't work.";
    break;
}

// ...

?>

It does carry some overhead, but compared to the alternative, it does the job
well.
===============================================================================

If you are retroactively going through included files to prevent them from
being accessed, you can use the following.

<?php
if($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] == __FILE__ )
    header('location: /'); // or exit();

// rest of code

?>

IntlChar::charFromName — Find Unicode character by name and return its code
point value

说明

public static int IntlChar::charFromName ( string $characterName [, int
$nameChoice = IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME ] )

Finds a Unicode character by its name and returns its code point value.

The name is matched exactly and completely. If the name does not correspond to
a code point, FALSE is returned.

A Unicode 1.0 name is matched only if it differs from the modern name. Unicode
names are all uppercase. Extended names are lowercase followed by an uppercase
hexadecimal number, and within angle brackets.

参数

characterName

    Full name of the Unicode character.

nameChoice

    Which set of names to use for the lookup. Can be any of these constants:
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME (default)
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_10_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::EXTENDED_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_ALIAS
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_CHOICE_COUNT

返回值

The Unicode value of the code point with the given name (as an integer), or
FALSE if there is no such code point.

范例

Example #1 Testing different code points

<?php
var_dump(IntlChar::charFromName("LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charFromName("SNOWMAN"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charFromName("RECYCLING SYMBOL FOR TYPE-1 PLASTICS"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charFromName(
"A RANDOM STRING WHICH DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO ANY UNICODE CHARACTER"));
?>

以上例程会输出：

int(65)
int(9731)
int(9843)
bool(false)

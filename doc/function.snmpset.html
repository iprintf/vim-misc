snmpset — 设置一个 SNMP 对象

说明

bool snmpset ( string $hostname , string $community , string $object_id , 
string $type , mixed $value [, int $timeout [, int $retries ]] )

设置指定的 SNMP 对象的值，成功返回 TRUE，错误则返回 FALSE。

函数 snmpset() 用于设置由 object_id 指定的 SNMP 对象的值。hostname 指定 SNMP 代
理，而 community 参数指定具有读权限的域。

===============================================================================

The "type" parameter must be one of the following, depending on the type of
variable to set on the SNMP host:

i    INTEGER
u    unsigned INTEGER
t    TIMETICKS
a    IPADDRESS
o    OBJID
s    STRING
x    HEX STRING
d    DECIMAL STRING
n    NULLOBJ
b    BITS

If OPAQUE_SPECIAL_TYPES was defined while compiling the SNMP library, the
following are also valid:

U    unsigned int64
I    signed int64
F    float
D    double

As an example, using "i" would set an integer, and "s" would set a string.  If
the SNMP host rejects the data type, you might get the following message:
"Warning: Error in packet. Reason: (badValue) The value given has the wrong
type or length."

If you specify an unknown or invalid OID, you might get a "Could not add
variable" message.  When specifying an absolute OID (one that is already
resolved) that is completely numeric, prepend it with a period.  For example,
an OID that could enable/disable Ethernet ports on an Asante hub might be
"1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.3.6.4.0", but you would need to use
".1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.3.6.4.0" in the OID parameter so that the SNMP library
won't try to resolve an already resolved OID.  Friendly, unresolved OIDs do not
need the period prepended, such as "system.SysContact.0"
===============================================================================

If you setting hex values correct format is:
snmpset($source_ip,$community,"$oid","x","10 10 10 10");
===============================================================================

Note that there are two ways to set a variable of the type BITS like e.g.:
  SYNTAX        BITS {telnet(0), ftp(1), http(2), icmp(3), snmp(4), ssh(5),
https(6)}

1. Using type "b" and a list of bit numbers like:
  snmpset('FOO-MIB::bar.42', 'b', '0 1 2 3 4');
with the disadvantage that the success is not easily verifyable as an snmpget()
for the same OID would return e.g. 0xF8.

2. Using type "x" and a hex number but without(!) the usual "0x" prefix:
  snmpset('FOO-MIB::bar.42', 'x', 'F0');
===============================================================================

If you have importet the MIB-Files into the MIB Tree with "snmp_read_mib" you
may use '=' as the "type" parameter.
In this case the type will also be taken from the loaded mib file. (Octest
strings will be interpreted like strings though)
Comes in handy for a more dynamic use of snmpset.

===============================================================================

Encrypt using public key, decrypt using private key.

Use this to store stuff in your database: Unless someone
has your private key, the database contents are useless.

Also, use this for sending to a specific individual:  Get
their public key, encrypt the message, only they can use
their private key to decode it.

<?php
echo "Source: $source";
$fp=fopen("/path/to/certificate.crt","r");
$pub_key=fread($fp,8192);
fclose($fp);
openssl_get_publickey($pub_key);
/*
* NOTE:  Here you use the $pub_key value (converted, I guess)
*/
openssl_public_encrypt($source,$crypttext,$pub_key);
echo "String crypted: $crypttext";

$fp=fopen("/path/to/private.key","r");
$priv_key=fread($fp,8192);
fclose($fp);
// $passphrase is required if your key is encoded (suggested)
$res = openssl_get_privatekey($priv_key,$passphrase);
/*
* NOTE:  Here you use the returned resource value
*/
openssl_private_decrypt($crypttext,$newsource,$res);
echo "String decrypt : $newsource";
?>

of course you have to add the openssl extension to you php environment.

IntlChar::charAge

(PHP 7)

IntlChar::charAge — Get the "age" of the code point

说明

public static array IntlChar::charAge ( mixed $codepoint )

Gets the "age" of the code point.

The "age" is the Unicode version when the code point was first designated (as a
non-character or for Private Use) or assigned a character. This can be useful
to avoid emitting code points to receiving processes that do not accept newer
characters.

参数

codepoint

    The integer codepoint value (e.g. 0x2603 for U+2603 SNOWMAN), or the
    character encoded as a UTF-8 string (e.g. "\u{2603}")

返回值

The Unicode version number, as an array. For example, version 1.3.31.2 would be
represented as [1, 3, 31, 2].

范例

Example #1 Testing different code points

<?php
var_dump(IntlChar::charage("\u{2603}"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charage("\u{1F576}"));
?>

以上例程会输出：

array(4) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
  [1]=>
  int(1)
  [2]=>
  int(0)
  [3]=>
  int(0)
}
array(4) {
  [0]=>
  int(7)
  [1]=>
  int(0)
  [2]=>
  int(0)
  [3]=>
  int(0)
}

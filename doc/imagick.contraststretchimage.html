Imagick::contrastStretchImage — Enhances the contrast of a color image

说明

bool Imagick::contrastStretchImage ( float $black_point , float $white_point [,
int $channel = Imagick::CHANNEL_ALL ] )

Enhances the contrast of a color image by adjusting the pixels color to span
the entire range of colors available. 此方法在Imagick基于ImageMagick 6.2.9以上
版本编译时可用。

参数

black_point

    The black point.

white_point

    The white point.

channel

    Provide any channel constant that is valid for your channel mode. To apply
    to more than one channel, combine channeltype constants using bitwise
    operators. Imagick::CHANNEL_ALL. Refer to this list of channel constants.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE。

The black and white points refer to the absolute number of pixels. In the
following example a coloured image is first desaturated (turned into a grey
scale image) and then the darkest 90% of pixels are turned black, the brightest
5% are made white, and those between 90% and 95% are grey-scaled:

<?php
$im = new Imagick ("some_image.jpg");
list ($width, $height) = array_values ($im->getImageGeometry ());
$im->modulateImage (100, 0, 100);
$im->contrastStretchImage ($width * $height * 0.90, $width * $height * 0.95);
$im->writeImage ("temp.jpg");
echo "<img src=\"temp.jpg\">";
?>

Trying to figure out what values the black and white points can have and what
their effects are nearly drove me around the bend. However, this works:

<?php
$width = 480;
$height = 360;
$mask = new Imagick ();
$mask->newImage ($width, $height, "black");
$draw = new ImagickDraw ();
$draw->setFillColor ("white");
$draw->ellipse ($width / 2, $height / 2, $width * 5 / 12, $height * 5 / 12, 0, 
360);
$mask->drawImage ($draw);
$mask->blurImage (0, 50);
$mask->contrastStretchImage (10, 125000);
$mask->writeImage ("mask.png");
?>

The result will be a vignette mask with the pixels in the corner being pure
black, and the ones in the middle pure white (which is not the case if the line
is commented out). Reducing the white value to, say, 100, turns most of the
grey pixels white.

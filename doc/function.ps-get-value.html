===============================================================================

Note that the modifier parameter is REQUIRED in some (perhaps all) cases where
you would not believe it to be required but optional:

<?php
$texty=ps_get_value($ps,'texty'); // does NOT work!

// but this works, however:

$foo=NULL;
$texty=ps_get_value($ps,'texty',$foo); // DOES work!

// this works too:
$texty=ps_get_value($ps,'texty',NULL);
?>

if your script just fails and sends a file with zero length to your browser
just try the workaround above. saves time and you will not get upset ;)

would be nice if somebody would be able to tell why pslib behaves this way ...

PHP version 4.4.4-8, pslib verision 0.2.7-1 (Debian etch)

Bye and a happy new year!

mysql_num_rows

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

mysql_num_rows — 取得结果集中行的数目

说明

int mysql_num_rows ( resource $result )

mysql_num_rows() 返回结果集中行的数目。此命令仅对 SELECT 语句有效。要取得被
INSERT，UPDATE 或者 DELETE 查询所影响到的行的数目，用 mysql_affected_rows()。

Example #1 mysql_num_rows() 例子

<?php

$link = mysql_connect("localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password");
mysql_select_db("database", $link);

$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM table1", $link);
$num_rows = mysql_num_rows($result);

echo "$num_rows Rows\n";

?>

    Note:

    如果使用 mysql_unbuffered_query()，则直到结果集中的所有行都被提取后 
    mysql_num_rows() 才能返回正确的值。

参见 mysql_affected_rows()，mysql_connect()，mysql_data_seek()，mysql_select_db
() 和 mysql_query()。

为向下兼容仍然可以使用 mysql_numrows()，但反对这样做。

I may indeed be the only one ever to encounter this - however if you have a
myisam table with one row, and you search with valid table and column name for
a result where you might expect 0 rows, you will not get 0, you will get 1,
which is the myisam optimised response when a table has 0 or one rows.  Under
"5.2.4 How MySQL Optimises WHERE Clauses" it reads:

*Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly detects that
some SELECT statements are impossible and returns no rows.

and

*All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the query. A
constant table is:
1) An empty table or a table with 1 row.
2) A table that is used with a WHERE clause on a UNIQUE index, or a PRIMARY
KEY, where all index parts are used with constant expressions and the index
parts are defined as NOT NULL.

Hopefully this will keep someone from staying up all night with 1146 errors,
unless I am completely mistaken in thinking I have this figured out.

Some user comments on this page, and some resources including the FAQ at :

http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/114/fid/12 suggest using
count(*) to count the number of rows

This is not a particularly universal solution, and those who read these
comments on this page should also be aware that

select count(*) may not give correct results if you are using "group by" or
"having" in your query, as count(*) is an agregate function and resets eachtime
a group-by column changes.

select sum(..) ... left join .. group by ... having ...

can be an alternative to sub-selects in mysql 3, and such queries cannot have
the select fields replaced by count(*) to give good results, it just doesn't
work.

Re my last entry:

This seems the best workaround to get an 'ordinary' loop going, with
possibility of altering output according to row number
(eg laying out a schedule)

$rowno=mysql_num_rows($result);

for ($i=0; $i<mysql_num_rows($result); $i++) {
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

print "<div class=\"showing\">";
print "<b>".$row['timeon']."-".$row['timeoff']."</b> ".$row['event']."<br />;
if ($i!=$rowno-1) {
    print "other-html-within-sched-here</div>";
    } 
else print "end-last-entry-html-here</div>";
}  //close loop

In response to oran at trifeed dot com:

You are only experiencing this behaviour because you have not given your
FOUND_ROWS() result an alias:

$qry = mysql_query ( 'SELECT FOUND_ROWS() AS total' );
$rst = mysql_fetch_array ( $qry, MYSQL_ASSOC );
echo $rst['total'];

Sean :)
===============================================================================

For me

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS together with
SELECT FOUND_ROWS()

Only worked with the following syntax:
$result = @mysql_query($query);
$resultTotal = @mysql_query("SELECT FOUND_ROWS()");
$res=    mysql_fetch_array($resultTotal);
echo $res['FOUND_ROWS()'];

hope it helped

Regarding SQL count(), see this faq :
* http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/114/fid/12
Note: If you already have a $result, use mysql_num_rows() on it otherwise use
SQL count().  Don't SELECT data just for a count.
===============================================================================

In Reply to the last post: This may not always work correctly, as $object->
doesExist would contain a result, not a boolean value. A better way (using the
same method) would be using a cast:

<?php
class Object {
  var $doesExist = false;

  [...]
  function load() {
    $result = mysql_query('...');
    $this->doesExist = (bool) ($res = mysql_fetch_array($result))
    [...]
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

In preventing the race condition for the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and FOUND_ROWS()
operations, it can become complicated and somewhat kludgy to include the
FOUND_ROWS() result in the actual result set, especially for complex queries
and/or result ordering. The query gets more complex, you may have trouble
isolating/excluding the FOUND_ROWS() result, and mysql_num_rows() will return
the number of actual results + 1, all of which makes your code messier and
harder to read. However, the race condition is real and must be dealt with.

A alternative and cleaner method is to explicitly lock the table using a WRITE
lock (preventing other processes from reading/writing to the table). The
downsides I can see are a performance hit, and your mysql user must have lock
permissions.

<?php
    // excuse the use of mysqli instead of mysql

    $mysqli->query("LOCK TABLE t WRITE");
    $results = $mysqli->query("SELECT id FROM t LIMIT 0,10");
    $totalNumResults = array_pop($mysqli->query("SELECT FOUND_ROWS()")->
fetch_row());
    $mysqli->query("UNLOCK TABLES");
?>

Now you may iterate through the results just like any other result set.
===============================================================================

MySQL 4.0 supports a fabulous new feature that allows you to get the number of
rows that would have been returned if the query did not have a LIMIT clause. 
To use it, you need to add SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS to the query, e.g.

$sql = "Select SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * from table where state='CA' limit 50";
$result = mysql_query($sql);

$sql = "Select FOUND_ROWS()";
$count_result = mysql_query($sql);

You now have the total number of rows in table that match the criteria.  This
is great for knowing the total number of records when browsing through a list.
===============================================================================

A pity there seems no way of getting the CURRENT  row number that's under
iteration in a typical loop,
such as:
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { }

After all there is an array of row arrays, as signified by
mysql_num_rows($result):

Say this gives "40 rows" : it would be useful to know when the iteration is on
row 39.

The nearest seems to be "data seek":but it connects directly to a
row number eg (from mysql_data_seek page)

for ($i = mysql_num_rows($result) - 1; $i >= 0; $i--) {
   if (!mysql_data_seek($result, $i)) {
       echo "Cannot seek to row $i: " . mysql_error() . "\n";
       continue;
   }

= it still wouldn't solve knowing what row number you're on in an ordinary
loop.

One reason for this situation is the php fetch (fetch-a-single-row)
construction, without any reasonable FOR loop possibility with row numbers.

Suggestion:
$Rows[$i] possibility where
$i would be the row number

$Rows[$row[], $row[], $row[].....]
             0            1            2     etc

-- the excellent retrieval WITHIN a row ( $row[$i] ),
while certainly more important,  is not matched by
similar possibilities for rows themselves.

and Count($result) doesnt work of course, $result being a
mere ticket-identifier...

It is faster to run second query "select count(...) from ... ", than adding
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS to your first query, and then using select FOUND_ROWS() +
mysql_num_rows().
===============================================================================

Object oriented version of wil1488 at gmail dot com's comment for counting
table rows:
<?php
$result = $mysqli->query("SELECT COUNT(*) as TOTALFOUND from table");
$row_array=$result->fetch_array(MYSQLI_ASSOC);
print($row_array['TOTALFOUND']);
?>
===============================================================================

Actually I am a little ashamed to be saying this, but I stand corrected about a
rather old note I posted on 17-Jul-2007 06:44.

Using SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and FOUND_ROWS( ) will NOT trigger a race condition
on MySQL, as that would pretty much defy their entire purpose.

The results for their usage is actually unique per connection session as it is
impossible for processes to share anything in PHP. As far as PHP is concerned,
each request represents a new connection to MySQL as each request is isolated
to its own process.

To simulate this, create the following script:

<?php

$Handle = mysql_connect( "localhost" , "root" , "" );
mysql_select_db( "lls" );

if( isset( $_GET[ 'Sleep' ] ) ) {
    mysql_query( "SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS `bid` From `blocks` Limit 1" );
} else {
    mysql_query( "SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS `aid` From `access` Limit 1" );
}

if( isset( $_GET[ 'Sleep' ] ) ) {
    sleep( 10 ); // Simulate another HTTP request coming in.
    $Result = mysql_query( "SELECT FOUND_ROWS( )" );
    print_r( mysql_fetch_array( $Result ) );
}

mysql_close( );

?>

Set the connection and query information for something that matches your
environment.

Run the script once with the Sleep query string and once again without it. Its
important to run them both at the same time. Use Apache ab or something
similar, or even easier, just open two browser tabs. For example:

http://localhost/Script.php?Sleep=10
http://localhost/Script.php

If a race condition existed, the results of the first instance of the script
would equal the results of the second instance of the script.

For example, the second instance of the script will execute the following SQL
query:

<?php

mysql_query( "SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS `aid` From `access` Limit 1" );

?>

This happens while the first instance of the script is sleeping. If a race
condition existed, when the first instance of the script wakes up, the result
of the FOUND_ROWS( ) it executes should be the number of rows in the SQL query
the second instance of the script executed.

But when you run them, this is not the case. The first instance of the script
returns the number of rows of its OWN query, which is:

<?php

mysql_query( "SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS `bid` From `blocks` Limit 1" );

?>

So it turns out NO race condition exists, and every solution presented to
combat this "issue" are pretty much not needed.

Good Luck,
===============================================================================

When mysql.trace_mode = On, SELECT FOUND_ROWS() allway returns 0.  It looks
like a bug.

In detail:

If you have a table with 5 rows and issue:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM table LIMIT 1;

mysql_num_rows() returns 1 as expected.

If you issue "SELECT FOUND_ROWS()" just in sequence, in the same connection
resource, it allways returns 0 rather than expected 5.

Just switch mysql.trace_mode to Off and things will work.
===============================================================================

A note on the following usage; that suggest to use several MySQL Functions to
get the number of Table Records.

You may be familiar with following:

<?php

$sqlQuery = 'Select SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS `MyField` From `MyTable` Limit 1;';

$sqlQuery_1 = 'Select FOUND_ROWS( );';

?>

I omitted the actual connection to MySQL and the execution of the query, but
you get the idea.

I did some tests and on a fairly high traffic web site, one that executes
several queries quite often and found that using this combination of MySQL
Functions can actually result in wrong results.

For example, assume I have two queries to get the number of Table Records in
two different Tables. So in essence, we are executing 4 queries ( 2 queries for
each Table ).

If two different requests come in through PHP, your going to run into problems.
Note than when I mean request, I mean two different clients requesting your PHP
page.

---------------
Request 1:
---------------

Execute: SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS On Table 1

---------------
Request 2:
---------------

Execute: SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS On Table 2

---------------
Request 1:
---------------

Execute: Select FOUND_ROWS( )

At this point, you see the race condition that occurred. While Request 1 was
being executed, Request 2 came in.

At this point Request 1 will return the number of Table Records in Table 2 and
not Table 1 as expected!

Why? Because MySQL does not differ between requests. Each query is in a queue
waiting its turn. As soon as its turn comes in it will be executed my MySQL.

The MySQL Function Select FOUND_ROWS( ) will return the result of the last
SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS!

Keep in mind.

<?
$strQuery="SELECT * FROM `tabel`";
$strResult = mysql_query($strQuery);
$Aantalvelden = mysql_num_fields($strResult);
$Aantalrijen=mysql_num_rows($strResult);

echo "<table border='1'><tr>";
for($ikolom=0;$ikolom<$Aantalvelden;$ikolom++){
$strVeldnaam = mysql_field_name($strResult,$ikolom);
echo "<td>$strVeldnaam</td>" ;
}
echo "</tr>";

for($ir=0;$irij<$Aantalrijen;$irij++){
echo "<tr>";
for($ikolom=0;$ikolom<$Aantalvelden;$ikolom++){
$strKolomwaarde = mysql_result($strResult,$irij,$ikolom);
echo "<td>$strKolomwaarde</td>";
}

echo "</table>";

Improvement to chrisdberry82 at gmail dot com's code:

<?php
$sql = "
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS
  '0', z.id
FROM
  zoom AS z
LIMIT
  0,6
UNION
  SELECT
    '1', FOUND_ROWS()
ORDER BY `0` DESC , RAND()";
?>

You can see, that you can even ORDER the final result anyway you like ;)
Then you can fetch the result like this:
<?php
$res = mysql_query($sql);
$count = mysql_fetch_assoc($res);
while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res)){
unset($row["0"]); //get rid of the "sorting col"
print_r($row); //or whatever ;)
}
echo $count["id"]; // the total number of rows
?>

And you got rid of the lousy IFs ;)

To use SQL COUNT function, without select the source...

see an example:

<?
//MAKE THE CONNECTION WITH DATABASE

$my_table = mysql_query("SELECT COUNT(*) as TOTALFOUND from table", $link); //
EXECUTE SQL CODE
Note: will return the total on TOTALFOUND

print (mysql_result($my_table,0,"TOTALFOUND")); //use the field camp to get the
total from your SQL query!
?>

Thanks, good luck.
===============================================================================

In one of my applications, I had to let an object know wether it exists in the
database or not. I found a cheap solution w/o the usage of mysql_num_rows():

<?php
class Object {
  var $doesExist = false;

  [...]
  function load() {
    $result = mysql_query('...');
    $this->doesExist = ($res = mysql_fetch_array($result))
    [...]
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

The following code can wrap it all up in a single query so you don't have to
worry about multiple client requests:

$stmtMain = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS jobid,title FROM
tbljobs
    LIMIT ?, ? UNION SELECT FOUND_ROWS(),'!!IgnoreCount!!';")

Then iterate through the results with something like:

while ($stmtMain->fetch() && $strResultTitle !="!!IgnoreCount!!") { 
//do stuff
}
($strResultSector == '!!IgnoreCount!!')? $intTotal = $intResultCount : 1;
===============================================================================

A small tip concerning SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and FOUND_ROWS()

Remember that you can us "AS" when working with mysql_fetch_assoc.

$sql="
    SELECT
        FOUND_ROWS() AS `found_rows`;
";
$result = mysql_query($sql);
$myrow = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
$row_count = $myrow['found_rows'];

echo $row_count;

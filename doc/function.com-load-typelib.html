com_load_typelib

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

com_load_typelib — 装载一个 Typelib

说明

bool com_load_typelib ( string $typelib_name [, bool $case_insensitive = true ]
)

Loads a type-library and registers its constants in the engine, as though they
were defined using define().

Note that it is much more efficient to use the  configuration setting to
pre-load and register the constants, although not so flexible.

If you have turned on  , then PHP will attempt to automatically register the
constants associated with a COM object when you instantiate it. This depends on
the interfaces provided by the COM object itself, and may not always be
possible.

参数

typelib_name

    typelib_name can be one of the following:
      □ The filename of a .tlb file or the executable module that contains the
        type library.

      □ The type library GUID, followed by its version number, for example
        {00000200-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4},2,0.

      □ The type library name, e.g. Microsoft OLE DB ActiveX Data Objects 1.0
        Library.

    PHP will attempt to resolve the type library in this order, as the process
    gets more and more expensive as you progress down the list; searching for
    the type library by name is handled by physically enumerating the registry
    until we find a match.

case_insensitive

    The case_insensitive behaves in the same way as the parameter with the same
    name in the define() function.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

Hello PHP community, I want to help in a problem I found in this COM built-in
function: com_load_typelib(), when I executed it in order to open a COM Server
process (for example: Word, Excel, etc.) I was in trouble to release the object
from memory, I figured it out, this is the solution:

Change a configuration in the php.ini:

; autoregister constants of a components typlib on com_load()
com.autoregister_typelib = true

When com.autoregister_typelib directive is true, PHP parser manage the COM
server type library, I hope it helps.
===============================================================================

Some libraries load other libraries as part of their functionality. For example
Crystal Reports Object Factory uses the CreateObject() method to create an
instance of a Crystal Design RunTime Application. If you want to use constants
defined in the newly loaded library, you will need to manually register the
library - even with com.autoregister_typelib set to true.

<?php
echo 'com.autoregister_typelib = ', ini_get('com.autoregister_typelib'), 
PHP_EOL;

$o_CrObjectFactory = New COM('CrystalReports11.ObjectFactory.1');

$o_CrApplication = $o_CrObjectFactory->CreateObject(
"CrystalDesignRunTime.Application");

echo 'Will not be defined : ', crOpenReportByDefault, PHP_EOL;

com_load_typelib('CrystalDesignRunTime.Application');

echo 'Will now be defined : ', crOpenReportByDefault, PHP_EOL;
?>

outputs ...

com.autoregister_typelib = 1
Will not be defined :
Notice: Use of undefined constant crOpenReportByDefault - assumed
'crOpenReportByDefault' in C:\refl.php on line 8
crOpenReportByDefault
Will now be defined : 0

I had some problems with a third-party Word-controlling code that is somewhat
similar to Richard's example. (Word 2007 SP1, XP SP2.) Rewrote some parts
according to that example, no luck. Error messages from Word were crazy:

"Bad parameter" -- it didn't like wdGoToBookmark but was ok with its numeric
equivalent -1;

"Call to undefined method variant::SaveAs()" -- the same with Save() that was
suitable in my case, so no options were remaining.

But then I ran the example via php.exe in the command line, and it worked!
Eventually it turned out that Apache service must be run as some real user
instead of SYSTEM.
===============================================================================

In case any of you were wondering what com_load_typelib actually DOES, I have
found that it loads constants\enums that the COM obeject has defined.  The
example below is using the Nero COM object (from Nero Burning rom, version
6+).  The Nero object defines a bunch of constants, but they can not be used as
PHP constants unless you use the mentioned function.  So the example below will
work just fine:

<?php
$aNero = new COM("Nero.Nero") or die ("Nero didn't load, too bad");
com_load_typelib("Nero.Nero");
$aNero->GetDrives(NERO_MEDIA_CD);
?>

But this one will not, since PHP will return a message saying that the constant
is undefined:

<?php
$aNero = new COM("Nero.Nero") or die ("Nero didn't load, too bad");
$aNero->GetDrives(NERO_MEDIA_CD);
?>

This one took me a while to figure out, hope it helps. 

Also, check out http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.com.php to find out how to get
COM events working in PHP.
===============================================================================

<?php
// Some servers may have an auto timeout, so take as long as you want.
set_time_limit(0);

// Show all errors, warnings and notices whilst developing.
error_reporting(E_ALL);

// Used as a placeholder in certain COM functions where no parameter is
required.
$empty = new VARIANT();

// Load the appropriate type library.
com_load_typelib('Word.Application');

// Create an object to use.
$word = new COM('word.application') or die('Unable to load Word');
print "Loaded Word, version {$word->Version}\n";

// Open a new document with bookmarks of YourName and YourAge.
$word->Documents->Open('C:/Unfilled.DOC');

// Fill in the information from the form.
$word->Selection->GoTo(wdGoToBookmark,$empty,$empty,'YourName'); // Note use of
wdGoToBookmark, from the typelibrary and the use of $empty.
$word->Selection->TypeText($_GET['YourName']);

$word->Selection->GoTo(wdGoToBookmark,$empty,$empty,'YourAge');
$word->Selection->TypeText($_GET['YourAge']);

// Save it, close word and finish.
$word->Documents[1]->SaveAs("C:/{$_GET['YourName']}.doc");
$word->Quit();
$word->Release();
$word = null;
print "Word closed.\n";
?>

The example document is ...

Hello [Bookmark of YourName], you are [Bookmark of YourAge] years old.

and it would be called ...

word.php?YourName=Richard%20Quadling&YourAge=35

Regards,

Richard.

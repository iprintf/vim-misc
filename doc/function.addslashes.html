addslashes

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

addslashes — 使用反斜线引用字符串

说明

string addslashes ( string $str )

返回字符串，该字符串为了数据库查询语句等的需要在某些字符前加上了反斜线。这些字
符是单引号（'）、双引号（"）、反斜线（\）与 NUL（NULL 字符）。

一个使用 addslashes() 的例子是当你要往数据库中输入数据时。例如，将名字 O'reilly
插入到数据库中，这就需要对其进行转义。强烈建议使用 DBMS 指定的转义函数（比如
MySQL 是 mysqli_real_escape_string()，PostgreSQL 是 pg_escape_string()），但是
如果你使用的 DBMS 没有一个转义函数，并且使用 \ 来转义特殊字符，你可以使用这个函
数。仅仅是为了获取插入数据库的数据，额外的 \ 并不会插入。当 PHP 指令
magic_quotes_sybase 被设置成 on 时，意味着插入 ' 时将使用 ' 进行转义。

PHP 5.4 之前 PHP 指令 magic_quotes_gpc 默认是 on，实际上所有的 GET、POST 和
COOKIE 数据都用被 addslashes() 了。不要对已经被 magic_quotes_gpc 转义过的字符串
使用 addslashes()，因为这样会导致双层转义。遇到这种情况时可以使用函数 
get_magic_quotes_gpc() 进行检测。

参数

str

    要转义的字符。

返回值

返回转义后的字符。

范例

Example #1 一个 addslashes() 例子

<?php
$str = "Is your name O'reilly?";

// 输出： Is your name O\'reilly?
echo addslashes($str);
?>

@ mark at hagers dot demon dot nl :

You shouldn't use str_replace() for this. Use a function like htmlentities(),
which will properly encode all user input for fields. That way, it will also
work if the user types &, <, >, etc.
===============================================================================

I was stumped for a long time by the fact that even when using addslashes and
stripslashes explicitly on the field values double quotes (") still didn't seem
to show up in strings read from a database. Until I looked at the source, and
realised that the field value is just truncated at the first occurrence of a
double quote. the remainder of the string is there (in the source), but is
ignored when the form is displayed and submitted.

This can easily be solved by replacing double quotes with "&quot;" when
building the form. like this:
$fld_value =  str_replace ( "\"", "&quot;", $src_string ) ;
The reverse replacement after the form submission is not necessary.
===============================================================================

To output a PHP variable to Javascript, use json_encode().

<?php

$var = "He said \"Hello O'Reilly\" & disappeared.\nNext line...";
echo "alert(".json_encode($var).");\n";

?>

Output:
alert("He said \"Hello O'Reilly\" & disappeared.\nNext line...") ;
===============================================================================

There are other functions "kind of" like this one but this should help adding
slashes to a form post which also contains arrays (and you can't access runtime
quotes), or you need to add slashes to an array which is already stripped:

<?php
    function addslashes_array($a){
        if(is_array($a)){
            foreach($a as $n=>$v){
                $b[$n]=addslashes_array($v);
            }
            return $b;
        }else{
            return addslashes($a);
        }
    }
?>

note this does not add slashes to the keys - you could easily modify to do
this..
===============================================================================

May it is better use the function mysql_real_escape_string instead of
addslashes when inserting data into a MySQL database. Check it at:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php
===============================================================================

What happends when you add addslashes(addslashes($str))? This is not a good
thing and it may be fixed:

function checkaddslashes($str){       
    if(strpos(str_replace("\'",""," $str"),"'")!=false)
        return addslashes($str);
    else
        return $str;
}

checkaddslashes("aa'bb");  => aa\'bb
checkaddslashes("aa\'bb"); => aa\'bb
checkaddslashes("\'"); => \'
checkaddslashes("'");  => \'

Hope this will help you
===============================================================================

For thelogrus, my testing shows the opposite--that a slashed string is stored
correctly by MySQL.  Consider

insert into test (field1) values ('test\'test')

...which is stored as "test'test".  If you were posting "Sir'Weaser" from a
form to your script and have magic_quotes_gpc on, then the string is slashed
already so if you run addslashes() again you will be entering "Sir\\'Weaser"
into MySQL.  In that case "Sir\'Weaser" would be the correct output.

In summary, addslashes() is not necessary if magic_quotes_gpc is on.
===============================================================================

In addition to the post made by Aditya P Bhatt below. This code works fine for
posting a single string but does not work for posting arrays.
===============================================================================

Note that when using addslashes() on a string that includes cyrillic
characters, addslashes() totally mixes up the string, rendering it unusable.
===============================================================================

Beware of using addslashes() on input to the serialize() function.   serialize
() stores strings with their length; the length must match the stored string or
unserialize() will fail. 

Such a mismatch can occur if you serialize the result of addslashes() and store
it in a database; some databases (definitely including PostgreSQL)
automagically strip backslashes from "special" chars in SELECT results, causing
the returned string to be shorter than it was when it was serialized.

In other words, do this...

<?php
$string="O'Reilly";
$ser=serialize($string);    # safe -- won't count the slash
$result=addslashes($ser);
?>

...and not this...

<?php
$string="O'Reilly";
$add=addslashes($string);   # RISKY!  -- will count the slash
$result=serialize($add);
?>

In both cases, a backslash will be added after the apostrophe in "O'Reilly";
only in the second case will the backslash be included in the string length as
recorded by serialize().

[Note to the maintainers: You may, at your option, want to link this note to
serialize() as well as to addslashes().  I'll refrain from doing such
cross-posting myself...]
===============================================================================

Never use addslashes function to escape values you are going to send to mysql.
use mysql_real_escape_string or pg_escape at least if you are not using
prepared queries yet.

keep in mind that single quote is not the only special character that can break
your sql query. and quotes are the only thing which addslashes care.
===============================================================================

If all you want to do is quote a string as you would normally do in PHP (for
example, when returning an Ajax result, inside a json string value, or when
building a URL with args), don't use addslashes (you don't want both " and '
escaped at the same time). Instead, just use this function:

<?php
function Quote($Str) // Double-quoting only
    {
    $Str=str_replace('"','\"',$Str);
    return '"'.$Str.'"';
    } // Quote
?>

Modify this easily to get a single-quoting function.
===============================================================================

Hello,

If you are getting trouble to SGDB write/read HTML data, try to use this:

<?php

//from html_entity_decode() manual page
function unhtmlentities ($string) {
   $trans_tbl =get_html_translation_table (HTML_ENTITIES );
   $trans_tbl =array_flip ($trans_tbl );
   return strtr ($string ,$trans_tbl );
}

//read from db
$content = stripslashes (htmlspecialchars ($field['content']));

//write to db
$content = unhtmlentities (addslashes (trim ($_POST['content'])));

//make sure result of function get_magic_quotes_gpc () == 0, you can get
strange slashes in your content adding slashes twice

//better to do this using addslashes
$content = (! get_magic_quotes_gpc ()) ? addslashes ($content) : $content;

?>
===============================================================================

spamdunk at home dot com, your way is dangerous on PostgreSQL (and presumably
MySQL). You're quite correct that ANSI SQL specifies using ' to escape, but
those databases also support \ for escaping (in violation of the standard, I
think). Which means that if they pass in a string that includes a "\'", you
expand it to "\'''" (an escaped quote followed by a non-escaped quote. WRONG!
Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL to drop your tables, make themselves
administrators, whatever they want.)

The best way to be safe and correct is to:

- don't use magic quotes; this approach is bad. For starters, that's making the
assumption that you will be using your input in a database query, which is
arbitrary. (Why not escape all "<"s with "&lt;"s instead? Cross-site scripting
attacks are quite common as well.) It's better to set up a way that does
whatever escaping is correct for you when you use it, as below:

- when inserting into the database, use prepared statements with placeholders.
For example, when using PEAR DB:

<?php
    $stmt = $dbh->prepare('update mb_users set password = ? where username = ?'
);
    $dbh->execute($stmt, array('12345', 'bob'));
?>

Notice that there are no quotes around the ?s. It handles that for you
automatically. It's guaranteed to be safe for your database. (Just ' on oracle,
\ and ' on PostgreSQL, but you don't even have to think about it.)

Plus, if the database supports prepared statements (the soon-to-be-released
PostgreSQL 7.3, Oracle, etc), several executes on the same prepare can be
faster, since it can reuse the same query plan. If it doesn't (MySQL, etc),
this way falls back to quoting code that's specifically written for your
database, avoiding the problem I mentioned above.

(Pardon my syntax if it's off. I'm not really a PHP programmer; this is
something I know from similar things in Java, Perl, PL/SQL, Python, Visual
Basic, etc.)

If you want to add slashes to special symbols that would interfere with a

In response to Krasimir Slavov and Luiz Miguel Axcar:

There are several encoding schemes for inserting binary data into places it
doesn't typically belong, such as databases and e-mail bodies. Check out the
base64_encode() and convert_uuencode() functions for the details.
===============================================================================

to quote boris-pieper AT t-online DOT de, 15-Jan-2005 06:07,

Note: You should use mysql_real_escape_string() (http://php.net/
mysql_real_escape_string) if possible (PHP => 4.3.0) instead of
mysql_escape_string().

You may also want to us it instead of addslashes.

re: problem with mcrypt, addslashes and mysql

Here is my solution to the problem of characters from mcrypt creating issues
with mysql calls (due to characters which aren't cleaned up by addslashes).

Solution: simply convert your encryption string to hex, then back to binary
when you are ready to decrypt.

<?php
// ie.
$encrypted = addslashes($string);   
$encrypted = bin2hex($encrypted);

// ... then:
$decrypted = hex2bin($encrypted);
$decrypted = stripslashes($decrypted);

// where hex2bin() is:
function hex2bin($hexdata) {
  $bindata="";
 
  for ($i=0;$i<strlen($hexdata);$i+=2) {
    $bindata.=chr(hexdec(substr($hexdata,$i,2)));
  }

  return $bindata;
}
?>

One word of caution: this will increase the length of your initial data string,
so you will need to increase the field length for your mysql database.

Cheers, Phil
PS. I knew that I'd eventually be able to give something back to the site!
===============================================================================

Be careful on whether you use double or single quotes when creating the string
to be escaped:

$test = 'This is one line\r\nand this is another\r\nand this line has\ta tab';

echo $test;
echo "\r\n\r\n";
echo addslashes($test);

$test = "This is one line\r\nand this is another\r\nand this line has\ta tab";

echo $test;
echo "\r\n\r\n";
echo addslashes($test);
===============================================================================

This function is deprecated in PHP 4.0, according to this article:

http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/05/23/2141246

Also, it is worth mentioning that PostgreSQL will soon start to block queries
involving escaped single quotes using \ as the escape character, for some
cases, which depends on the string's encoding.  The standard way to escape
quotes in SQL (not all SQL databases, mind you) is by changing single quotes
into two single quotes (e.g, ' ' ' becomes ' '' ' for queries).

You should look into other ways for escaping strings, such as
"mysql_real_escape_string" (see the comment below), and other such database
specific escape functions.
===============================================================================

addslashes does NOT make your input safe for use in a database query! It only
escapes according to what PHP defines, not what your database driver defines.
Any use of this function to escape strings for use in a database is likely an
error - mysql_real_escape_string, pg_escape_string, etc, should be used
depending on your underlying database as each database has different escaping
requirements. In particular, MySQL wants \n, \r and \x1a escaped which
addslashes does NOT do. Therefore relying on addslashes is not a good idea at
all and may make your code vulnerable to security risks. I really don't see
what this function is supposed to do.
===============================================================================

Remember to slash underscores (_) and percent signs (%), too, if you're going
use the LIKE operator on the variable or you'll get some unexpected results.
===============================================================================

As mentioned, magic_quotes_gpc automatically adds slashes to POST and GET data
and these slashes don't go in the database.  BUT, be careful of this. If you
have a form with an error check, make sure you strip the slashes if your form
remembers the OK fields, so the user doesn't view these automagically added
slashes.
===============================================================================

Here's an example of a function that prevents double-quoting, I'm surprised
noone has put something like this up yet... (also works on arrays)

<?php
function escape_quotes($receive) {
    if (!is_array($receive))
        $thearray = array($receive);
    else
        $thearray = $receive;
   
    foreach (array_keys($thearray) as $string) {
        $thearray[$string] = addslashes($thearray[$string]);
        $thearray[$string] = preg_replace("/[\\/]+/","/",$thearray[$string]);
    }
   
    if (!is_array($receive))
        return $thearray[0];
    else
        return $thearray;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Based on:
Danijel Pticar
05-Aug-2009 05:22
I recommend this extended version, to replace addslashes altogether(works for
both strings and arrays):
<?php
function addslashesextended(&$arr_r)
{
    if(is_array($arr_r))
    {
        foreach ($arr_r as &$val)
            is_array($val) ? addslashesextended($val):$val=addslashes($val);
        unset($val);
    }
    else
        $arr_r=addslashes($arr_r);
}
?>
===============================================================================

this is my version of an addslashes function, useful for processing $_POST
array:

<?php
function add_slashes ($an_array) {
  foreach ($an_array as $key => $value) {
    $new_array[$key] = addslashes($an_array[$key]);
  }
}
?>

then call it:

<?php add_slashes($_POST); ?>
===============================================================================

Automagically add slashes to $_POST variables. It helps to prevent some sql
injection attacks. Also works with $_GET variables.

FILE NAME: input_cl.php
<?php
//create array to temporarily grab variables
$input_arr = array();
//grabs the $_POST variables and adds slashes
foreach ($_POST as $key => $input_arr) {
    $_POST[$key] = addslashes($input_arr);
}
?>

Just put this at the top of your script that gets the variables. Here is an
example.

Usage Example
<?php
include("input_cl.php");
// all $_POST variables have slashes added to them
$f_name = $_POST["f_name"];
$l_name = $_POST["l_name"];
$phone_num = $_POST["phone_num"];
$address1 = $_POST["address1"];
$address2 = $_POST["address2"];
$city = $_POST["city"];
$State = $_POST["State"];
$zip = $_POST["zip"];

//sql insert code goes here.
?>
===============================================================================

If you have problems with adding images or other binady data with addslashes()
for php 4.3 >= use:

<?php
$search = array("\x00", "\x0a", "\x0d", "\x1a", "\x09");
$replace = array('\0', '\n', '\r', '\Z' , '\t');

$chrData .= str_replace($search, $replace, $Data );
?>

and put in your SQL field='$chrData' ! please remark quotes
===============================================================================

re: encryption, addslashes and mysql

Note that mcrypt encryption may add in an apostrophe from the ascii table which
cannot be protected by addslashes. It may not even be on your keyboard.

Because encryption strings are random, you may not discover it unless you test
(or stumble?) on the correct sequence which inserts an apostrophe in the
encrypted string.

This means that testing is even more important where encryption is concerned.
If I create a solution I'll post it here.

Phil
===============================================================================

Actually I prefer to escape the SQL queries completely (then no more challenge
for data security);

<?php
function escape_query($str) {
    return strtr($str, array(
        "\0" => "",
        "'"  => "&#39;",
        "\"" => "&#34;",
        "\\" => "&#92;",
        // more secure
        "<"  => "&lt;",
        ">"  => "&gt;",
    ));
}
?>

// &#39;&#34;&#92;
echo escape_query("'\"\\\0");

// &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;
echo escape_query("<\0script>alert(1)<\0/script>");

// See more: www.asciitable.com

Hi,
I use this recursive function for POST. It handles multidimensional arrays.

<?php
function as_array(&$arr_r)
{
foreach ($arr_r as &$val) is_array($val) ? as_array($val):$val=addslashes($val
);
unset($val);
}

as_array($_POST);
?>
===============================================================================

Even for simple json string backslash encodings, do not use this function. Some
tests may work fine, but in json the single quote (') must not be escaped.
===============================================================================

About Raymond and Aditya's post

Following code can help you to add slashes with posted array.
I just added a recursive function with Aditya's code.

<?php
//create array to temporarily grab variables
$input_arr = array();
//grabs the $_POST variables and adds slashes
foreach ($_POST as $key => $input_arr) {
    if(is_array($input_arr)){       
        $_POST[$key] = addslashes_array($input_arr);
    }else{
        $_POST[$key] = addslashes($input_arr);
    }
   
}

// Recursive Function to add slashes with posted array.
function addslashes_array($input_arr){
    if(is_array($input_arr)){
        $tmp = array();
        foreach ($input_arr as $key1 => $val){
            $tmp[$key1] = addslashes_array($val);
        }
        return $tmp;
    }else{
        return addslashes($input_arr);
    }
}

?>
===============================================================================

If you're trying to escape quotes in a javascript event as such:

<img src="foo.gif" OnMouseOver="alert('<? print $myString ?>')">

It helps to perform this first:

$myString = str_replace("'", "\'", $myString);
$myString = str_replace('"', "'+String.fromCharCode(34)+'", $myString);
===============================================================================

Regarding the previous note using addslashes/stripslahes with regular
expressions and databases it looks as if the purpose of these functions gets
mixed.

addslahes encodes data to be sent to a database or something similar. Here you
need addslashes because you send commands to the database as command strings
that contain data and thus you have to escape characters that are special in
the command language like SQL.

Therefore the use of addslahses on a regex does properly store the regex in the
database.

stripslashes does the opposite: it decodes an addslashes encoded string.
However, retrieving data from a database works differently: it does not go
through some string interpretation because you actually retrieve your binary
data in your variables. In other words: the data stored in your variable is the
unmodified binary data that your database returned. You do not run stripslahes
on data returned from a database. That way, the regexs are retrieved correctly,
too.

This is different from other data exchange like urlencoded strings that you
exchange with your browser. Here the data channel uses the same encodings in
both directions: therefore you have to encode data to be sent and you have to
decode data received.
===============================================================================

so you can use replace single quote and double quote with HTML Entities

for example

<?php
/**
* replcae quotes to HTML entities by names or numbers
*
* @param (string) escaped string value
* @param (string) default ='number' will be return to number entities you can
use ='name' to return name entities
* Note : don't use ='name' coz (&apos;) (does not work in IE)
*/
function quote2entities($string,$entities_type='number')
{
    $search                     = array("\"","'");
    $replace_by_entities_name   = array("&quot;","&apos;");
    $replace_by_entities_number = array("&#34;","&#39;");
    $do = null;
    if ($entities_type == 'number')
    {
        $do = str_replace($search,$replace_by_entities_number,$string);
    }
    else if ($entities_type == 'name')
    {
        $do = str_replace($search,$replace_by_entities_name,$string);
    }
    else
    {
        $do = addslashes($string);
    }
    return $do;
}

echo quote2entities("I love 'PHP' for ever");
// will return I love 'PHP' for ever in browsere
// but in view code and database will be  I love &#34;PHP&#34; for ever in
source
?>

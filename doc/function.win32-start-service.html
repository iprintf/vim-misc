===============================================================================

If you get a 1053 error when trying to launch your service, check your service
script for errors!

E.g. if you have some syntax errors, the service will attempt to run the php
interpreter, but the script won't answer to the service manager with
win32_start_service_ctrl_dispatcher('servicename').

Don't think it is because the call comes to late. It just never came, because
there were errors. Test your services with CLI php and then try to run the
service.
===============================================================================

[This] can solve 1053 issue.
You just need to add " if you have spaces in your path...

<?php
win32_create_service(array(
        'service' => 'COMPLAINTS',                 # the name of your service
        'display' => 'Receive email complaints and direct them to the website',
# description
        'params' => '"' . __FILE__ . '"' . ' run', # path to the script and
parameters
    ));
?>

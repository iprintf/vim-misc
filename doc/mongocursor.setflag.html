MongoCursor::setFlag

(PECL mongo >=1.2.11)

MongoCursor::setFlag — Sets arbitrary flags in case there is no method
available the specific flag

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::setFlag ( int $flag [, bool $set = true ] )

The MongoCursor class has several methods for setting flags on the query
object. This method is available in case the MongoDB wire protocol has acquired
a new flag, and the driver has not been updated with a method for this new
flag. In all other cases, the method should be used. See the "See also" section
for available methods.

参数

flag

    Which flag to set. You can not set flag 6 (EXHAUST) as the driver does not
    know how to handle them. You will get a warning if you try to use this
    flag. For available flags, please refer to the wire protocol
    » documentation.

set

    Whether the flag should be set (TRUE) or unset (FALSE).

返回值

Returns this cursor.

错误／异常

Shows a warning when an unsupport flag is attempted to be set.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
1.4.0 Support for flag 3 (OPLOG_REPLAY) is added. Versions before 1.4.0 would
      throw a warning saying that the flag is unsupported.

$cursor = $c->find( array( 'ns' => 'demo.article', 'op' => 'i' ) );
$cursor->setFlag( 1, true ); // sets the tailable flag
$cursor->setFlag( 5, true ); // sets the await data flag

===============================================================================

If you try to free an XML parser while it is still parsing, strange things will
happen - your script will "hang" and no output will be sent to the browser.
Consider this pseudo-code example:

-------

...
if (!xml_parse($parser)) echo 'XML error';

xml_parser_free($parser);

...

function SomeCallbackWhichWasSetBefore(...)
{
global $parser;

...

if (some_error_happened) xml_parser_free($parser);  //problem!

...

}

------

It would be logical that xml_parse would return false if the parser was freed
while parsing, right? Wrong! Instead, everything hangs and no output will be
sent out (no matter whether output buffering is on or not). It took me more
than an hour to figure out why: you cannot free a parser handle that is
currently parsing. A simple solution:

-------

$xml_error = false;
if (!xml_parse($parser))
echo 'XML error (directly from parser)';
else if ($xml_error)
echo 'XML error (from some callback function);

xml_parser_free($parser);

...

function SomeCallbackWhichWasSetBefore(...)
{
global $parser;
global $xml_error;

if ($xml_error)
return;

...

if (some_error_occured)
{
$xml_error = false;
return;
}

...

}

-------

If you use this solution you will have to check for $xml_error in every
callback function. Essentially what you're doing is that, in case you want to
stop parsing because of an error, you continue until xml_parse() is finished
(without actually doing anything) and then free the parser and act on the
error.

Of course the underlying problem is that you cannot stop a parser while it is
parsing. There should be some function like xml_throw_error() or
xml_parser_stop() or whatever, but unfortunately there isn't.
===============================================================================

I found that with PHP 4.3.4RC1, if you don't call xml_parser_free() before your
script ends, some sort of ugliness occurs with the webserver; i.e. the HTTP
connection is closed.  (The apache error_log says "exit signal Segmentation
fault (11)".)

Usually PHP tends to clean up connections you don't explicitly close (e.g.
database connections), but in this case apparently it doesn't.

Some web browsers (MSIE for one) do not actually show this problem, so you may
not actually notice it.  Opera 7.11 does show it, which is how I discovered it.

So don't forget to call xml_parser_free() ... always!

mysqli::ping

mysqli_ping

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

mysqli::ping -- mysqli_ping — Pings a server connection, or tries to reconnect
if the connection has gone down

说明

面向对象风格

bool mysqli::ping ( void )

过程化风格

bool mysqli_ping ( mysqli $link )

Checks whether the connection to the server is working. If it has gone down,
and global option mysqli.reconnect is enabled an automatic reconnection is
attempted.

This function can be used by clients that remain idle for a long while, to
check whether the server has closed the connection and reconnect if necessary.

参数

link

    仅以过程化样式：由mysqli_connect() 或 mysqli_init() 返回的链接标识。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 mysqli::ping() example

面向对象风格

<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", $mysqli->connect_error);
    exit();
}

/* check if server is alive */
if ($mysqli->ping()) {
    printf ("Our connection is ok!\n");
} else {
    printf ("Error: %s\n", $mysqli->error);
}

/* close connection */
$mysqli->close();
?>

过程化风格

<?php
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

/* check if server is alive */
if (mysqli_ping($link)) {
    printf ("Our connection is ok!\n");
} else {
    printf ("Error: %s\n", mysqli_error($link));
}

/* close connection */
mysqli_close($link);
?>

以上例程会输出：

Our connection is ok!

This does not work with mysqlnd and is marked as wontfix: https://bugs.php.net/

===============================================================================

As jay at grooveshark dot com very helpfully pointed out, the mysqlnd driver
which is becoming pretty standard does not obey reconnect commands. If you have
a DB wrapper class (which hopefully you do) you can implement your own version
of ping() such as:

<?php

class db extends mysqli
{
    private $db_host;
    private $db_user;
    private $db_pass;
    private $db_name;
    private $persistent;

    public function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name, 
$persistent = true)
    {
        $this->db_host = $db_host;
        $this->db_user = $db_user;
        $this->db_pass = $db_pass;
        $this->db_name = $db_name;
        $this->persistent = $persistent;

        parent::init();
        parent::options(MYSQLI_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 1);
        @parent::real_connect(($this->persistent ? 'p:' : '') . $this->db_host,
$this->db_user, $this->db_pass, $this->db_name);

        if ($this->connect_errno)
            die("All DB servers down!\n");
    }

    public function ping()
    {
        @parent::query('SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()');

        if ($this->errno == 2006)
            $this->__construct($this->db_host, $this->db_user, $this->db_pass, 
$this->db_name, $this->persistent);
    }
...
}

$db = new db(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME);
// Some code that potentially takes a really long time to execute goes here
// Ping for safety to try to gracefully reconnect
$db->ping();
// Now we should be able to run queries again
$db->query('SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()');

?>

If you wanted you could even put "$this->ping();" at the top of db::query() to
avoid any explicit reconnection calls but I wouldn't recommend it due to the
(slight) overhead of running the cheap "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()" query every
time prior to running your real intended query. There are probably even cheaper
queries to run in favor of "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()" but it was the first that
came to mind and is cheap enough for most purposes since you shouldn't be
calling ping() a whole bunch anyway.
===============================================================================

The behaviour about the option mysqli.reconnect is default set to Off at Debian
PHP Packages. So i would recommend to update the first line description about
the recommendation at the option mysqli.reconnect. (practice note ;))

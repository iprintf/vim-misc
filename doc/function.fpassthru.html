fpassthru

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fpassthru — 输出文件指针处的所有剩余数据

说明

int fpassthru ( resource $handle )

将给定的文件指针从当前的位置读取到 EOF 并把结果写到输出缓冲区。

如果已经向文件写入数据，就必须调用 rewind() 来将文件指针指向文件头。

如果既不修改文件也不在特定位置检索，只想将文件的内容下载到输出缓冲区，应该使用 
readfile()，这样可以省去 fopen() 调用。

参数

handle

    文件指针必须是有效的，必须指向由 fopen() 或 fsockopen() 成功打开的文件(并还
    未由 fclose() 关闭)。

返回值

如果发生错误， fpassthru() 返回 FALSE。否则 fpassthru() 返回从 handle 读取并传
递到输出的字符数目。

范例

Example #1 对二进制文件使用 fpassthru()

<?php

// 以二进制格式打开文件
$name = './img/ok.png';
$fp = fopen($name, 'rb');

// 发送合适的报头
header("Content-Type: image/png");
header("Content-Length: " . filesize($name));

// 发送图片并终止脚本
fpassthru($fp);
exit;

?>

注释

    Note:

    当在 Windows 系统中将 fpassthru() 用于二进制文件，要确保在用 fopen() 打开文
    件时在 mode 中附加了 b 来将文件以二进制方式打开。

    鼓励在处理二进制文件时使用 b 标志，即使系统并不需要，这样可以使脚本的移植性
    更好。

  • fopen() - 打开文件或者 URL
  • popen() - 打开进程文件指针

also it is possible to make your php script resume downloads, to do this you
need to check $_SERVER['HTTP_RANGE'] which may contain something like this
"bytes=10-" - resume from position 10, and to end of file

when sending response it is also needed to send with headers
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: {filesize}
Content-Range: bytes 10-{filesize-1}/{ffilesize}

hope its usefull
===============================================================================

If your downloaded files are getting corrupted, one of the scripts included/
required in your download script or page may have whitespace around the <?php
?> tags.  A common enough problem, but most often recognized when header()
fails, due to headers already being sent, but one worth mention here.

This one bit me just recently with my download script.  Somewhere along the way
adding functionality to my website, I wound up with a space (not a blank line,
which I usually spot right away, but a single space character) after the
closing ?> tag in one of the require()'d files.  Oddly enough, all the
downloads seemed to work ok, but the files were corrupted: that space character
wound up at the beginning of each file.
===============================================================================

Passthru didn't work for me for files greater than about 5Mb. Just adding
"ob_end_clean()", all works fine now, including > 50Mb files.

$ToProtectedFile=$pathUnder.$filename
$handle = @fopen($ToProtectedFile, "rb");

@header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
@header("Pragma: no-cache"); //keeps ie happy
@header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename= ".$NomFichier);
@header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
@header("Content-Length: ".$SizeOfFile);
@header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');

ob_end_clean();//required here or large files will not work
@fpassthru($handle);//works fine now
===============================================================================

In relation to using sessions and fpassthru together.

Try adding: session_write_close()

somewhere near the top of the download script, before you start sending the
video, and that should take care of it.

I've implemented and tested session_write_close() and it works like a dream.
Other links can now be clicked and loaded whilst a big file is being passed
using fpassthru.

Big thanks to Greg for this tip. What a helpful community we live in :0)

This code works fine with a download manager... maybe not the best solution,
but the only one that works with IE!!!!!

It forces download, but gif file don't want to be downloaded!!! so I need to
simply display them in browser...

NB $file is the result of a query on the file table...

require_once("auth.inc.php");
$attachment = (strstr($HTTP_USER_AGENT, "MSIE")) ? "" : " attachment"; // IE
5.5 fix.
//Content of file
if (!headers_sent()){
   $ficexp=explode('.',$file["orig_name"]);
   $ext=$ficexp[sizeof($ficexp)-1];
   if ($ext!='gif'){
           header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');
           header('Pragma: no-cache');
           header("Content-Type: application/force-download");
           header("Content-Length: ".filesize("files/".$file["save_name"]));
           header("Content-Disposition: ".$attachment."; filename=".$file
["orig_name"]);
   }
   $fn=fopen("files/".$file["save_name"], "rb");
   fpassthru($fn);
}
else {
    MessageBox('Headers already sent, cannot force download!');
}

To throttle download-speed of specific files this works fine in my board hosted
on my local machine:

//#######################################
$big_file=filesize($completeFilePath)/1024; //size of file in kb
header('Content-Type: '.$mime_type);
header('Content-disposition: '.$content_disp.'filename=
"'.$attachment_name.'"');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Expires: 0');
header('Content-Length: '.(string)(filesize($completeFilePath)));
$fp=fopen($completeFilePath,'r');
while(!feof($fp)) {
     $buffer = fread($fp, 1024*6); //speed-limit 6kb/s
     if ($big_file>32 &&
     $extension!="jpg" &&
     $extension!="jpeg" &&
     $extension!="gif" &&
     $extension!="png" &&
     $extension!="txt")
     sleep(1); //if filesize>32kb and no smallfile like jpg,gif or so - wait 1
second
     print $buffer;
}
fclose($fp);
header ("Connection: close");
//#######################################

I think it's the easiest way to slow down downloading files without using a
loop or for-next - this really saves performace of php and is quite exact by
using 1024*number_of_kb in one second...

Thats all

Just a little thing more from the ssharma's script (thx to him for his great
help ...) :

Don't forget to put the fopen with the "rb" argument and not just with the "r"
or you won't be able to make the script work with all pdf file.

My final script (working for Open and Save on a 1.9 Mb complex PDF file) :

<?php
//The filename is stored in the $produitFilename variable in my script (the
only thing you need)

// You need to specify the REAL path for your file and not the URL
$fullPath    = getcwd()."./directory_where_the_file_is/".$produitFilename;

if ($fd = fopen ($fullPath, "rb")) {
    $fsize    =filesize($fullPath);
    $fname     = basename ($fullPath);

    header("Pragma: ");
    header("Cache-Control: ");
    header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$fname."\"");
    header("Content-length: $fsize");

    fpassthru($fd);
}
?>

Have fun and thx u all 4 ur great help ...

A few notes on using fpassthru() to php-driven download links that pop up a
"Save As.." dialog:

1. I found that the download progress dialog was remaining up for several
seconds after the transfer was completed, before telling the user it was
complete.  This was fixed by adding the following header:

header ("Connection: close");

This will cause the connection to be closed as soon as the transfer is
complete, rather than waiting for a timeout.

2. If you have multiple periods in the filename, you might wind up with a
filename with numbers in brackets (such as myfile-[1][0]-windows.zip when you
put myfile-1.0-windows.zip in the headers) with MSIE.  According to Microsoft's
KB, his is a "known" bug having to due with MSIE's cache and there's no
workaround that I was able to find.

3. Through no amount of futzing of headers was I able to get the filename to be
set properly when the actual transfer was initiated via a refresh (META or via
headers).  I don't know if this is also an MSIE only issue or not.  If
'download.php?dl=now' (for example) had a refresh back to 'download.php', such
that it was intended to show some information (e.g. install instructions) as
well as launch the download, then the MSIE insisted that the downloaded file
was supposed to be named 'download.php?dl=now' or 'download.php', ignoring the
filename in the headers.
===============================================================================

Here is a final working copy that won't freak out Microsoft Explorer if you are
using sessions. Thanks to everyone else who came before. This is not as simple
as I thought it would be.

the user would pass a call to the page:
http://mysite/getfile.php?file=products.pdf

include 'base.inc'; // inlcude base code, start session  and manage users

// This loads the file global from the post/get variables
// For security reasons register globals is disabled
LoadPostGet('file');

$filename = '/data/files/' . $file;
if(file_exists($filename)){
  $FILECMD = '/usr/bin/file';
  $contentType = '';
  $fp=popen("$FILECMD -bin $filename", 'r');
  if (!$fp) $contentType='application/octet-stream';
  else {
    while($string=fgets($fp, 1024)) $contentType .= $string;
    pclose($fp);
  }
  if(strpos($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE')){
    // IE cannot download from sessions without a cache
    header('Cache-Control: public');
  }
  header("Content-type: $contentType");
  header("Content-Disposition:inline; filename=\"".$file."\"");
  header("Content-length:".(string)(filesize($filename)));
  $fd=fopen($filename,'rb');
  while(!feof($fd)) {
    print fread($fd, 4096);
  }
  fclose($fd);
}else{
  print "File Not Found";
}
===============================================================================

The above method worked for me after trying everything else imaginable to get
Explorer to download a file via PHP. However, I had to change the
content-length line. No need to "stringify" the $size variable as in the above
post. The method below works for both small and very large file (tested on
files larger than 30MB with no probs)...

<?php
$distribution="/path/to/a/file.exe"
if ($fd = fopen ($distribution, "r")){

          $size=filesize($distribution);
          $fname = basename ($distribution);

//This is some really weak code I used just to redirect to the file before I
fixed
//this problem...it makes the browser handle the download via Apache instead of
PHP
//but it would be really easy to then find out the true location of the file

               //header("Location: $distribution");
             //fclose ($fd);
             //exit;

//below is a much better way to do it...

     header("Pragma: ");
      header("Cache-Control: ");
     header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
      header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$fname."\"");
      header("Content-length: $size");

          while(!feof($fd)) {
               $buffer = fread($fd, 2048);
               print $buffer;
          }
          fclose ($fd);
          exit;
}
?>

Good luck.

===============================================================================

Update to the above. This also sets the correct mime type for the file you're
sending. It's a small hack since it relies on the "file" system command but it
should work well.

<?
// full path to the file command
$FILECMD='/usr/bin/file';
// directory where the file resides
$fileDir='/home/mcaserta';
// full file name
$fileName='test.sh';

// END CONFIG

$completeFilePath=$fileDir.'/'.$fileName;
$fp=popen("$FILECMD -bin $completeFilePath", 'r');

if (! $fp) $contentType='application/octet-stream';
else {
  while($string=fgets($fp, 1024)) $contentType .= $string;
  pclose($fp);
}

header('Content-type: '.($contentType));
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="'.($fileName).'"');
header('Content-length: '.(string)(filesize($completeFilePath)));
$fd=fopen($completeFilePath,'r');
fpassthru($fd);
?>
===============================================================================

In case of multiple buffering possibility try running ob_end_clean() from the
example below in a loop:

while (@ob_end_clean());

It will help for example in case of automatic gz compression of output.
===============================================================================

here is my code, i tried several combinations, but most of them didnt work, and
had all kinds of unnecessary headers in them, etc. this has additional good
features, such as it stops sending the file if the connection stops (hopefully
it does anyways), and it fixes IE filename problems when sending files that
contain more than one dot in them by using a simple  preg_replace (IE likes to
terminate the filename and messes everything up):

<?
function send_file($path) {
    session_write_close();
    ob_end_clean();
    if (!is_file($path) || connection_status()!=0)
        return(FALSE);

    //to prevent long file from getting cut off from     //max_execution_time

    set_time_limit(0);

    $name=basename($path);

    //filenames in IE containing dots will screw up the
    //filename unless we add this

    if (strstr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], "MSIE"))
        $name = preg_replace('/\./', '%2e', $name, substr_count($name, '.') -
1);

    //required, or it might try to send the serving     //document instead of
the file

    header("Cache-Control: ");
    header("Pragma: ");
    header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Length: " .(string)(filesize($path)) );
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$name.'"');
    header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n");

    if($file = fopen($path, 'rb')){
        while( (!feof($file)) && (connection_status()==0) ){
            print(fread($file, 1024*8));
            flush();
        }
        fclose($file);
    }
    return((connection_status()==0) and !connection_aborted());
}

?>
===============================================================================

While trying to "passthru" a file to the browser via PHP, but using the FEOF
loop, the script tried to buffer the entire file before passing it to the
browser. This is my original script. When calling it with a 15M PHP memory
limit and a 16M file, apache killed the script.

<?php
    $name = $tempDir . $_GET["file"];
    $fd = fopen($name, 'rb');
   
    if($fd == false)
   
        die("<font color=red>ERROR: File not found.</font>");
   
    // send the right headers
    header("Cache-Control: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors
    header("Pragma: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors
    header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . $_GET["file"] . "\
"");
    header("Content-length:".(string)(filesize($name)));
    sleep(1);

    session_write_close();
    ob_flush();
    flush();
   
         while(!feof($fd)) {
    
               $buffer = fread($fd, 2048);
               print $buffer;
         }
    
         fclose ($fd);
         exit;
?>

Apache error log read:
Allowed memory size of 15728640 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 10240 bytes)

I tried everything, including a flush() inside the loop. But the solution was
forcing the flush other way:

<?php

    $buffer = fread($fd, 32 * 1024);

?>

voila... works just fine for me.
===============================================================================

The way the PHP page is generated (buffered or not, and how if buffered) has an
impact of the download function made using fpassthru (or fread, ...). I mean a
download function may work just fine when it is called from a simple php file
(no buffering here):

<?php
    function download($file) { ... }
   
    $filename = "/tmp/test.zip";
    download($filename);
?>   

but may fails "in the real life" when the page is buffered:

<?php
    ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
    ...
    require_once(download.php);
    ...
    $filename = "/files/file.zip";
    download($filename);
?>

In my particular case, only Firefox 1.0 English did not perform the download,
because of the ob_start("ob_gzhandler"). Replacing it by ob_start() solved the
problem.

Hope that helps

I've modified the example given by straz at -removethispart-mac dot com to
count each byte of the file out.  This can then be compared with the filesize
once the file sending is complete to determine whether the file was sent
succesfully or not.

Of course, this doesn't guarantee that the user actually recieved the file
successfully though will let us know if something goes wrong half way through
reading/sending the file at our end.

<?
/* fpassthru is apparantly a memory-hog. Use this instead */
    while(!feof($fp)) {
        $buf = fread($fp, 4096);
        echo $buf;
        $bytesSent+=strlen($buf);    /* We know how many bytes were sent to the
user */
    }
?>

I've then got this code to update my database to say that the file was
downloaded successfully.

<?
    if($bytesSent==filesize($file)) {
        /* Do some cool stuff here! */
    }
?>
===============================================================================

I have also perused this list of examples which I am sure work for that person,
but, as others have mentioned here, do not work for me or (anyone else).

So what I did was try out all of these examples, check other sources of
information, and put together what I think to be an example of what works on
'more than a few' systems.  The following example works for me wherever I need
to create a download using fpassthru(), which works with IE6 (among other
browsers):

<?
/*/
Download a file using fpassthru()
/*/
$fileDir = "/home/pathto/myfiles"; // supply a path name.
$fileName = "myfile.zip"; // supply a file name.
$fileString=$fileDir.'/'.$fileName; // combine the path and file
// translate file name properly for Internet Explorer.
if (strstr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], "MSIE")){
  $fileName = preg_replace('/\./', '%2e', $fileName, substr_count($fileName,
'.') - 1);
}
// make sure the file exists before sending headers
if(!$fdl=@fopen($fileString,'r')){
    die("Cannot Open File!");
} else {
  header("Cache-Control: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors
  header("Pragma: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors
  header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
  header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".$fileName."\"");
  header("Content-length:".(string)(filesize($fileString)));
    sleep(1);
    fpassthru($fdl);
}
?>

All that should require editing is the $fileDir and $fileName variables. 
Upload the file and point to it with your browser to see if the script will
prompt you for a download.

NOTE : Regarding File Types : Leaving the 'Content-type' header as-is should
allow you to download pretty much any file.  I have tested it on some of the
more popular file types including zip, css, php, inc, htm, png, gif and jpg. 
During these tests, I did note that if I selected 'cancel' or 'open' when
prompted to download either a gif or jpg, that it would indeed cancel or open
in my image browser as it should, but subsequent attempts at 'downloading only'
yielded a web page view of the image.  Closing the window and opening a new one
reset this, allowing me save a jpeg or gif to the hard drive directly.  I
believe the problem lies in the way the caching headers are treated, since if
any info is specified in the 'cache-control' header, the browser download fails
completely (in IE, anyways).

Enjoy! Mail me if it works!  ;-)
===============================================================================

I've tried all of these renditions of this elusive task.  NONE of them have
worked for me.  And when i say work, i mean where i can click some sort of link
and have a file Save As... dialog box come up on MSIE 6.0.  In every other
browser i've tried (Safari,Firebird,Netscape pc and mac) all have worked where
it downloads to my desktop or asks me to save it in a certain place.

on MSIE 6.0.  the file i'm trying to download appears in it's own window. it's
an image. BUT, the only thing i can do with it is SAVE IT AS A BMP. ugh.

I'm using the fpassthru function because i have files that must not be served
by the webserver.
===============================================================================

This might save someone some time. I created a program to list some rather
large files and create links for the end user to click on in order to download
them (using the php function fpassthru()).

The problem I was having was it would make it half way through the download
(about 377 megs) and the script would terminate and the download would stop.

After doing some shotgun troubleshooting I discovered the php config option
'max_execution_time = 30'. Upon changing it to 'max_execution_time = -1' the
files >370 megs can be downloaded without the script aborting.

Here's a summary the different headers you need to set to make downloads
*always* work with IE and Mozilla:

[SNIP]
  $disposition = "inline"; // "inline" to view file in browser or "attachment"
to download to hard disk
  $mime = "image/jpeg"; // or whatever the mime type is
  $name = "foo.jpg"; // file name
  $path = "/path/to/foo.jpg"; // full path and file name

  if (isset($_SERVER["HTTPS"])) {
      /**
       * We need to set the following headers to make downloads work using IE
in HTTPS mode.
       */
      header("Pragma: ");
      header("Cache-Control: ");
      header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");
      header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
      header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
      header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
  }
      else if ($disposition == "attachment") {
          header("Cache-control: private");
  }
  else {
      header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
      header("Pragma: no-cache");
  }
  header("Content-Type: $mime");
  header("Content-Disposition:$disposition; filename=\"".trim(htmlentities
($name))."\"");
  header("Content-Description: ".trim(htmlentities($name)));
  header("Content-Length: ".(string)(filesize($path)));
  header("Connection: close");
[/SNIP]

This way all kinds of download work for me. Hope that helps
===============================================================================

Note that if you use these two headers from a previous example:

header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');
header('Pragma: no-cache');

before sending a file to the browser, the "Open" option on Internet Explorer's
file download dialog will not work properly. If the user clicks "Open" instead
of "Save," the target application will open an empty file, because the
downloaded file was not cached. The user will have to save the file to their
hard drive in order to use it.

Make sure to leave these headers out if you'd like your visitors to be able to
use IE's "Open" option.
===============================================================================

In reply to:

"3. Through no amount of futzing of headers was I able to get the filename to
be set properly when the actual transfer was initiated via a refresh (META or
via headers).  I don't know if this is also an MSIE only issue or not.  If

was supposed to be named 'download.php?dl=now' or 'download.php', ignoring the
filename in the headers."

I recently had the exact same issue.  What I found is that this was due to my
session initialization on the page.  For some reason doing a session_start()
caused the script to try and download itself, not what I was indicating through
various header() calls.

The solution was to move the download portion above the session
initialization.  At first glance this may seem dangerous, but I only process it
if there are POST vars and the script is reloading itself.  This way I know the
form was submitted by that page and before they can submit it, they have to
have a session!  Adding an .htaccess rule to deny all for the directory where
the files are stored also helps because then only my script can access the
files.
===============================================================================

Found a workaround to another headache that just cropped up tonight. 
Apparently Opera 6.1 on Linux (unsure of other versions/platforms) has problems
downloading files using the above methods if you have enabled compression via
zlib.output_compression in php.ini.

It seems that Opera sees that the actual transfer size is less than the size in
the "Content-length" header for the download and decides that the transfer was
incomplete or corrupted.  It then either continuously retries the download or
else leaves you with a corrupted file.

Solution:  Make sure your download script/section is off in its own directory.
and add the following to your .htaccess file for that directory:

php_flag zlib.output_compression off
===============================================================================

Found a workaround for the MSIE cache bug that puts brackets around dotted
items I posted about a while back (e.g. "somefile1.0-xyz.zip" becoming
"somefile[1][0]-xyz.zip").

It turns out if you encode all but the last dot as %2e, then MSIE won't do
this.  If you encode all of them (including the last dot), then MSIE sticks an
extra bracketed number at the end of the file (e.g. "somefile1.0-xyz.zip[1]"). 
Unfortunately, however, some other browsers then want to save the file with the
%2e in the filename instead of the dots.

if (strstr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], "MSIE"))
{
    $fileName = preg_replace('/\./', '%2e', $fileName,
        substr_count($fileName, '.') - 1);
}

Viola.  Properly named files.  This works at least with MSIE 6.0.
===============================================================================

Note that the above comment about the "Connection: close" header is incorrect:
it does not guarantee that the connection will be closed immediately after the
transfer is complete. Instead, it informs the client that it can no longer use
the existing HTTP connection to perform other HTTP requests on the same server,
and that the client MUST close the connection as soon as it has finished
handling the current request.

If the client (for example an old HTTP proxy) is using HTTP/1.0, it may not
recognize this header, and could could the connection open; the web server
should detect this and close the connection and ignore any further request
attempt on that connection.

HTTP/1.1 clients MUST honor this header and close their connection as soon as
they detect the end of the answer.

In any case, the web server will initiate a watchdog after script completion,
and will force the deconnection after about 15 to 30 seconds if the client does
not honor this header.

The exact time to wait for the "socket closed by remote" event is configurable
in the web server.

It is generally smaller when the "Connection: close" header has been sent by
the server, than when no "Connection:close" has been sent (in which case the
connection persists for longer time, to let the client navigate on the server
without enduring new connection costs in terms of: connection delays, number of
socket control blocks in final wait state, number of used ports).

Don't abuse "Connection: close" on your server for every hosted page: this
creates more incoming TCP connection attempts than necessary, and slows the
navigation on your site. Use it only if your script cannot generate explicit
content length in the result header, as the client will have difficulties to
determine the end of the results.

If you want to save connection resources to your server, always send an
Explicit "Content-Length" header within your script, or use the "chunked"
transfer-encoding to explicitly send the result by delimited fragments (if the
client is using HTTP/1.1, it MUST support this chunked transfer encoding, per
specification). See RFC2616 for details.

fpassthru() works best for small files. In download manager scripts, it's best
to determine the URL of the file to download (you may generate it locally in
your session data if you need so), and then use HTTP __temporary__ redirects
(302 status code, with a "Location:" header specifying the effective download
URL).

This saves your web server from maintaining PHP scripts running for long times
during the file downloadn and instead the download will be managed directly by
the web server without scripting support (consequence: less memory resources
used by parallel downloads)...
===============================================================================

Interesting results using fpassthru() vs. fread() under UNIX.

Using fread(fp, length) to read from a valid, open pointer, in which the
filename has a special character (single quote, comma, open paren, etc) fails
on the read (no debug statements written after that). However, using fpassthru
() works like a champ.

Thanks for the helpful notes on IE session info, have seen this before but
didn't know what was causing it.
===============================================================================

If you trying to output a user-written file on a page for verifying, editing,
etc, you'll want to use fopen(), fread(), htmlentities() to avoid malicious
code. Text from fpassthru, while not parsed per se can still mess up the
display of a page (or at least it did for me!) --mt.
===============================================================================

I could not get the above examples to work.  This is what I used instead:

header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$file");
header("Content-Description: Image File");
$fd = fopen($file,'r');
fpassthru($fd);
===============================================================================

I wrote a page which authenticates the user, then calls fpassthru() to download
an Acrobat document. It worked great up to about 1MB, but for larger files, the
script was dying in the middle. My ISP told me they were killing my script
because it was a memory hog. I tried readfile() instead, to no avail.

I replaced the fpassthru() with this workaround. It works great:

while(!feof($fn)) {
   $buffer = fread($fn, 4096);
   print $buffer;
}
===============================================================================

If you open a new file, write to it and then call fpassthru() it doesn't work.
You need to call rewind() first to set the file pointer to the begining of the
file.
===============================================================================

I believe the following problem is a result of using sessions and fpassthru
together.

I have a subscription based site which protects large video files (WMV format
between 100-120MB) by storing them beneath web root. Downloading a video file
requires the user to click a HTML link which requests a PHP script e.g.
download-video.php?video_id=123. If the user is valid (session vars created
from sucessful login) the script then creates the necessary headers to trigger
a 'Save As' download box, opens the file from beneath web root and sends it
using fpassthru.

The problem is as follows:

The user should be able to click other links on the site whilst a file is
downloading. But when they do so, the requested page won't load until the
download is complete.

As this download script is a seperate PHP request, the user should be able to
load other pages on the site whilst the file is downloading.

At time of writing, I've tried almost everything to remove this bug. There must
be a problem with using a PHP script rather than a direct web server link to
download files.
===============================================================================

In reply to spam at flatwan dot net
This might save someone some time. I created a program to list some rather
large files and create links for the end user to click on in order to download
them (using the php function fpassthru()).

The problem I was having was it would make it half way through the download
(about 377 megs) and the script would terminate and the download would stop.

After doing some shotgun troubleshooting I discovered the php config option
'max_execution_time = 30'. Upon changing it to 'max_execution_time = -1' the
files >370 megs can be downloaded without the script aborting.

The best way to do this would to be:
<?php
@ignore_user_abort();
@set_time_limit(0);
?>
This only changes these settings for the script that calls them. (Thanks to (I
don't remember who) who wrote a form mail script that used these two lines)

(Do not delete this, it is NOT a bug report. It is a *follow up* to vague
comments on the page about fpassthru() using excessive memory, and a usage tip
that if you want to use pass-through processing, PHP 5 is strongly advised. It
may LOOK like a bug report because unlike earlier tips, I've tried to clarify
the situation. It is not a bug report because the problem is RESOLVED in PHP 5.
Rather, anyone still using PHP 4 (for example, for compatibility reasons)
should simply be aware that the problem is now resolved.)

In PHP 4 (4.4.4 tested as a CGI, Apache 2, Linux), use of both fpassthru() and
fread() in a loop suffer the SAME memory "leakage". This is characterised by
all data that is sent to the client also being kept inside PHP and not
released. It would appear to be a failure to garbage collect the data.

In PHP 5 (5.2.1 tested as a CGI, Apache 2, Linux) this flaw is resolved in both
cases. Neither fpassthru() nor fread() in a loop "leak" memory during
execution.

The issue of which one to use appears not to be an issue of memory as both were
equally flawed in PHP 4 and both are equally fixed in PHP 5.

Speed, is left to a reader exercise to test in the latest PHPs.

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

syslog — Generate a system log message

说明

bool syslog ( int $priority , string $message )

syslog() generates a log message that will be distributed by the system logger.

For information on setting up a user defined log handler, see the syslog.conf 
(5) Unix manual page. More information on the syslog facilities and option can
be found in the man pages for syslog (3) on Unix machines.

参数

priority

    priority is a combination of the facility and the level. Possible values
    are:

    syslog() Priorities (in descending order)
     Constant              Description
    LOG_EMERG   system is unusable
    LOG_ALERT   action must be taken immediately
    LOG_CRIT    critical conditions
    LOG_ERR     error conditions
    LOG_WARNING warning conditions
    LOG_NOTICE  normal, but significant, condition
    LOG_INFO    informational message
    LOG_DEBUG   debug-level message

message

    The message to send, except that the two characters %m will be replaced by
    the error message string (strerror) corresponding to the present value of 
    errno.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Using syslog()

<?php
// open syslog, include the process ID and also send
// the log to standard error, and use a user defined
// logging mechanism
openlog("myScriptLog", LOG_PID | LOG_PERROR, LOG_LOCAL0);

// some code

if (authorized_client()) {
    // do something
} else {
    // unauthorized client!
    // log the attempt
    $access = date("Y/m/d H:i:s");
    syslog(LOG_WARNING, "Unauthorized client: $access {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']}
 ({$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']})");
}

closelog();
?>

注释

On Windows NT, the syslog service is emulated using the Event Log.

    Note:

    Use of LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7 for the facility parameter of openlog
    () is not available in Windows.

If anyone is wondering why their log messages are appearing in multiple log
files, here is one answer applying to *nix systems:

If your syslog.conf looks like this (assuming you use LOG_LOCAL0 for web app
logging) :

local0.info    /var/log/web/info.log

This will collect *all* messages of LOG_INFO level and higher, i.e everything
except debug messages

Try this instead to ensure that only messages of the named log level go into
the relevant log file:

local0.=info    /var/log/web/info.log

Additionally, you may like to add this to ensure your messages don't end up in
generic log files like "messages"  "all" "syslog" and "debug":

local0.none    /var/log/messages
local0.none    /var/log/debug
etc

saves disk space among other things - more at "man syslog.conf"
===============================================================================

A word of warning; if you use openlog() to ready syslog() and your Apache
threads accept multiple requests, you *must* call closelog() if Apache's error
log is configured to write to syslog.  Failure to do so will cause Apache's
error log to write to whatever facility/ident was used in openlog.

Example, in httpd.conf you have:

ErrorLog syslog:local7

and in php you do:

<?php
openlog("myprogram", 0, LOG_LOCAL0);
syslog("My syslog message");
?>

From here on out, this Apache thread will write ErrorLog to local0 and under
the process name "myprogram" and not httpd!  Calling closelog() will fix this.
===============================================================================

If you are using syslog-ng and want errors send to syslog then use ini setting
"error_log = syslog" and add something like the following to your
syslog-ng.conf:

destination php { file("/var/log/php.log" owner(root) group(devel) perm(0620));
};
log { source(src); filter(f_php); destination(php); };
===============================================================================

For those who want to simultaneously write to multiple syslog facilities :

syslog(LOG_INFO|LOG_LOCAL0, "message for local0");
syslog(LOG_INFO|LOG_LOCAL1, "message for local1");
===============================================================================

This *does* actually goto the system log as configured in /etc/syslog.conf
(such as /var/log/messages), it doesn't goto Apache's ErrorLog (such as /var/
log/httpd/error_log). At least under my Debian Potato with Apache 1.3.23.

Use error_log() to be sure it gets into Apache's ErrorLog.
===============================================================================

This work for me, to redirect  logs to a separate syslog file

put this line in your /etc/syslog.conf :

local0.debug   /var/log/php.log

Then restart syslogd:

/etc/init.d/syslog restart

php example:

<?php
define_syslog_variables();
openlog("TextLog", LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL0);

$data = date("Y/m/d H:i:s");
syslog(LOG_DEBUG,"Messagge: $data");

closelog();
?>
===============================================================================

The documentation is incorrect when it says "Priorities (in descending order)",
as the table that follows is actually in **ascending** order.

For example my output says:
LOG_ERR : 4
LOG_WARNING : 5
LOG_DEBUG : 6

An important difference, that caused me some pain!
===============================================================================

I had a problem trying to issue a syslog message with IIS 5.1 under Windows XP.
The function call seemed to succeed, but the event viewer showed that no entry
was made.
Finally I found out that the user account used for the webserver (IUSR_
<Computername>) did not have enough permissions to issue syslog alerts. I
changed this by adding this user to the Users group instead of only Guest.
===============================================================================

The message string sent to the log file is limited to 500 characters.
===============================================================================

To set up a custom log file via the syslog daemon (FreeBSD in this case)...

Add to /etc/syslog.conf a line that says all errors from the httpd process are
to go to a file called (for example) /var/log/httpd-php.log

!httpd
*.*   {tab}   /var/log/httpd-php.log

Note the tab, being a tab character! Next create a blank file to be written to.
I'm sure there are 1e+6 ways to do this, but I choose

# cat > httpd-php.log << EOF
? EOF

Finally find your syslog daemon and send it a sighup to inform it of the
change:

# ps ax | grep syslogd
  133  ??  Ss     0:07.23 syslogd -s
# kill -1 133

Et voila! Php syslog calls will now arrive in /var/log/httpd-php.log
===============================================================================

With FreeBSD I can use: syslog(LOG_INFO,"test");

BSD/OS does not support this, I had to use the literal values for the priority
(158: local3.info):
syslog(158,"test");
===============================================================================

For the-header-file-enabled:

man 3 syslog defines the priorities, but not the integer values. For that
you'll need to read your system header file.

Let's suppose I want to log an informational message in the mail log (which
happens to be true). The man page tells me I want LOG_MAIL|LOG_INFO. So I look
in /usr/include/sys/syslog.h and find (this happens to be Linux, your system
could be different):

#define LOG_INFO        6       /* informational */
#define LOG_MAIL        (2<<3)  /* mail system */

2<<3 means shift 3 bits left, which means multiply by 8. So I want 2*8 + 6 =
22. syslog(22,"this message will appear in the mail log"); And indeed it does.
===============================================================================

In Windows NT, use the following values of priority:
1 = error,
6 = info
===============================================================================

Be aware when using syslog() that if you set the timezone of environment to be
something other than the standard, syslog() may log the time to the log(s) with
the wrong time zone information. For example:

<?php

openlog('mylog', LOG_PID | LOG_ODELAY,LOG_LOCAL4);

putenv('TZ=UTC');
syslog(LOG_INFO, 'UTC Log line');

putenv('TZ=US/Pacific');
syslog(LOG_INFO, 'US/Pacific Log line');

closelog();

?>

Viewing the /usr/log/messages log will display these two lines:

Apr 11 01:25:39 hostname mylog[1400]: UTC Log line
Apr 10 18:25:39 hostname mylog[1400]: US/Pacific Log line

(on Red Hat Linux Secure Server v6.2).

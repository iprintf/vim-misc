SphinxClient::setRankingMode — Set ranking mode

说明

public bool SphinxClient::setRankingMode ( int $ranker )

Sets ranking mode. Only available in SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED2 matching mode.

                                 Ranking modes
       Constant                               Description
SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25 Default ranking mode which uses both proximity and BM25
                        ranking.
                        Statistical ranking mode which uses BM25 ranking only
SPH_RANK_BM25           (similar to most of other full-text engines). This mode
                        is faster, but may result in worse quality on queries
                        which contain more than 1 keyword.
                        Disables ranking. This mode is the fastest. It is
SPH_RANK_NONE           essentially equivalent to boolean searching, a weight
                        of 1 is assigned to all matches.

参数

ranker

    Ranking mode.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

Sphinx search support now more than  3 ranking  mode.

1) SPH_RANK_NONE ranker just assigns every document weight to 1.

2) SPH_RANK_WORDCOUNT ranker counts all the keyword occurrences and multiplies
them by user field weights.

3) SPH_RANK_FIELDMASK ranker returns a bit mask of matched fields.

4) SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY, the default ranker in SPH_MATCH_ALL legacy mode, simply
passes the phrase proximity for a weight.

5) SPH_RANK_MATCHANY ranker, used to emulate legacy MATCH_ANY mode, combines
phrase proximity and the number of matched keywords so that, with default
per-field weights, a) longer sub-phrase match (aka bigger phrase proximity) in
any field would rank higher, and b) in case of agreeing phrase proximity,
document with more matched unique keywords would rank higher. In other words,
we look at max sub-phrase match length first, and a number of unique matched
keywords second. In pseudo-code,

6) SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25, the default SphinxQL ranker and also the default
ranker when “extended” matching mode is used with SphinxAPI

7) SPH_RANK_BM25 ranker sums user weights of the matched fields and BM25.

8) SPH_RANK_SPH04 ranker further improves on PROXIMITY_BM25 ranker (and
introduces numbers instead of meaningful names, too, because a name would be
way too complicated). Phrase proximity is still the leading factor, but, within
a given phrase proximity, matches in the beginning of the field are ranked
higher, and exact matches of the entire field are ranked highest.

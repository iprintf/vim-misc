===============================================================================

Here is a simple function to ease changing fonts in your PDF.

function pdf_font($pdf,$size,$face='arial')
{
   //Set the path 
   $path=$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
   ${$face} = $face."=$path/fonts/".$face.".ttf";

   pdf_set_parameter($pdf, 'FontOutline',${$face});
      
   $font=pdf_findfont($pdf,$face,"host",0);
  
    pdf_setfont($pdf,$font,$size);
}
===============================================================================

Note that core font Helvetica-Bold does not accept font sizes>12 .
This probably affects other core fonts.
===============================================================================

Note that pdf_setfont (this function) and pdf_set_font (a deprecated function)
are different. I spent a while trying to figure out why my code wasn't working;
it turns out I'd included the extra underscore by accident...
===============================================================================

For those who are looking
the PDF core fonts Are

Courier,Courier-Bold,Courier-Oblique,Courier-BoldOblique,
Helvetica,Helvetica-Bold,Helvetica-Oblique,Helvetica-BoldOblique,
Times-Roman,Times-Bold,Times-Italic,Times-BoldItalic,
Symbol,ZapfDingbats

To anyone who is trying to add extra FONTS to work with PHP and pdflib.

Take a look at: ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/afmfiles/ - This is
collection of fonts already converted to AFM. There are thousands of fonts.
What I am doing is downloading everything, and then I will grep my way through
the directories to find what I am looking for.

Another tip: to get the pdflib.upr file working with your fonts add:
putenv("PDFLIBRESOURCE=/dir/where/the/file/is/fonts/pdflib.upr");
on the beginning of your php script. And make sure you change the Font
Definition entry on your pdflib.upr file as well. It needs to point to the
directory where the .afm files are.
===============================================================================

There is also another encoding called 'host'. in the pdflib test examples, they
say:
" We don't want to use metrics files for the sample, and therefore stick to
host encoding. For this reason the sample text (which uses German special
characters) must be platform-specific. Both flavors only differ in the special
characters."

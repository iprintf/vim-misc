The DOTNET class

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

Description

The DOTNET class allows you to instantiate a class from a .Net assembly and
call its methods and access its properties.

$obj = new DOTNET("assembly", "classname")

Methods

DOTNET::__construct ( string $assembly_name , string $class_name [, int
$codepage ] )

DOTNET class constructor. assembly_name specifies which assembly should be
loaded, and class_name specifices which class in that assembly to instantiate.
You may optionally specify a codepage to use for unicode string
transformations; see the COM class for more details on code pages.

The returned object is an overloaded object, which means that PHP does not see
any fixed methods as it does with regular classes; instead, any property or
method accesses are passed through to COM and from there to DOTNET. In other
words, the .Net object is mapped through the COM interoperability layer
provided by the .Net runtime.

Once you have created a DOTNET object, PHP treats it identically to any other
COM object; all the same rules apply.

Example #1 DOTNET example

<?php
 $stack = new DOTNET("mscorlib", "System.Collections.Stack");
 $stack->Push(".Net");
 $stack->Push("Hello ");
 echo $stack->Pop() . $stack->Pop();
?>

    Note:

    You need to install the .Net runtime on your web server to take advantage
    of this feature.

Using COM and DOTNET directly is quite a nightmare. DOTNET only allows you to
target .Net 3.5 and below, and all the binaries need to be COM  Visible. This
basically means that you will need to write your own .Net binaries for
everything, at least wrappers.

There is a library out there (NetPhp) built on top of the COM class that will
solve all these issues, so you can get code like this:

$manager = new \NetPhp\Core\NetManager();
$manager->RegisterAssembly('mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089', 'mscorlib');
$manager->RegisterClass('mscorlib', 'System.IO.File', 'File');
$manager->RegisterClass('mscorlib', 'System.IO.FileOptions', 'FileOptions');
$file = $manager->Create('mscorlib', 'File');
$fileoptions = $manager->Create('mscorlib', 'System.IO.FileOptions')->Enum
('Encrypted');

$file->Create("C:\\www\\prueba.tres", 2048, $fileoptions);

Create an Excel Workbook using DOTNET.

<?php

$full_assembly_string = 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, Version=14.0.0.0,
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71e9bce111e9429c';
$full_class_name = 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass';

$e = new DOTNET($full_assembly_string, $full_class_name);
$wb = $e->workbooks->add();
$Precios = $wb->Worksheets(1);
$Precios->Name = 'Precios';
$Venta = $wb->Worksheets(2);
$Venta->Name = 'Venta';
$Tons = $wb->Worksheets(3);
$Tons->Name = 'Tons';

$Meses = Array('2014-01', '2014-02', '2014-03', '2014-04', '2014-05', '2014-06'
, '2014-07', '2014-08', '2014-09', '2014-10', '2014-11', '2014-12');
foreach ($Meses as $Numero => $Mes) {
   $Precios->Range("A" . ($Numero+1))->Value = $Mes;
}

$wb->SaveAs('c:\temp\Meta.2014.05.xlsx');
$wb->Close();

?>

Go to c:\windows\assembly to know what value to put in $full_assembly_string.

If you don't know the assembly, use http://www.red-gate.com/products/
dotnet-development/reflector/ to browse it, use what you learn there to fill
$full_class_name.

Enjoy,

Ricardo.

In order to find out what the PublicKeyToken value is, open up Explorer and go
to c:\windows\assembly.  In that directory you will see all of the registered
assemblies along with their PublicKeyToken value.

PHP searches only GAC for .NET 2.0 runtime, so your DLL has to be targeted 2.0
- 3.5 framework.

Also it recognize only classes, not stucts, so you can't instantiate DateTime
for example.
===============================================================================

First, I hit the same mine:

"... Failed to instantiate .Net object [Unwrapped, QI for IDispatch]
[0x80004002] No such interface supported ..."

In order to load the assembly and class in it successfully, I had to change my
AssemblyInfo.cs file regarding the visibility of the types in it.

// some code above

// This sets the default COM visibility of types in the assembly to invisible.
// If you need to expose a type to COM, use [ComVisible(true)] on that type.
[assembly: ComVisible(true)]

// some code below
===============================================================================

For strongly-named NET assemblies that are registered in the GAC, you can just
use the assembly name
e.g: $x = new DOTNET ("myAssembly", "myClass");

For strongly-named NET assemblies that aren't registered in the GAC, you need
to use the full assembly string
e.g. $x = new DOTNET('myAssembly, Version=X.X.X.X, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=ZZZZZZZZZZZZ', 'myClass');

You can't instantiate assemblies that haven't been strongly named.

"Strongly named" means that the assembly has a public key. To strongly name
your own classes in Visual Studio, go to the Signing tab in the project
properties and click the 'sign the assembly' box and choose a key file name.

To register an assembly in the GAC, there are various tools around to do that,
but the easiest method is to drag-and-drop the compiled assembly into c:\
windows\assembly using windows explorer (a shell extension is installed by
default that handles registering dragged files).
===============================================================================

If you want to load any other assembly apart from mscorlib, you'll need to
include it like the following

$x = new DOTNET('The.Assembly.Name, Version=X.X.X.X, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=ZZZZZZZZZZZZ', 'The.Class.Name');

Replace all relevant details.

How to use donet class for creating object of parameterized constructor

http://php.net/manual/en/class.dotnet.php

private SGF ingerPrintManager m_FPM; //member variable
SGFPMDeviceName device_name = SGFPMDeviceName.DEV_ FDU02 ;
m_FPM = new SGF ingerPrintManager (device_name);
===============================================================================

As suggested before, you'll likely have to use a full assembly string including
the assembly name, the assembly version (not the dll file version), the
culture, and the public key token.  Otherwise, you'll get a 'file not found'
catchable error.  To quickly find this on your own system to get the ball
rolling, open C:\Windows\assembly in explorer (not in cmd as that shows a
different view), scroll down the list until you find the assembly you want to
work with, hover the mouse over it, and the tooltip shows the exact string to
use (though processcorArchitecture if shown is optional).  You'll have to use
.net utilities or other methods to automate collecting this info on other
machines.

You'll also have to use the fully-qualified class name.  In other words, if you
want to use the 'Form' class within 'System.Windows.Forms', you have to use the
full class hierarchy 'System.Windows.Forms.Form'.  Otherwise you'll get an
unhelpful 'Failed to instantiate .Net object' catchable error.

The following example shows the correct syntax to use the 'Form' class to pop
up a blank form from php-cli, which can be used in leu of many Windows GUI PHP
extensions out there.  Replace Version with your local version, and
PublicKeyToken with your own local key token.

<?php

$full_assembly_string = 'System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=
neutral, PublicKeyToken=a8425bc35256e463';
$full_class_name = 'System.Windows.Forms.Form';
$form = new DOTNET($full_assembly_string, $full_class_name);

// code to add buttons, menus, text, etc

$form->Show();

$form_event = '';
while($form_event !== 'close') {

  // handle form functions and events

  }
?>

final public static void Ev::suspend ( void )

Ev::suspend() and Ev::resume() methods suspend and resume the default loop
correspondingly.

, and all periodic watchers will be rescheduled(that is, they will lose any
events that would have occurred while suspended).

After calling Ev::suspend() it is not allowed to call any function on the given
loop other than Ev::resume() . Also it is not allowed to call Ev::resume()
without a previous call to Ev::suspend() .

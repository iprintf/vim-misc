(PHP 5 >= 5.4.0, PHP 7)

SessionHandlerInterface::write — Write session data

说明

abstract public bool SessionHandlerInterface::write ( string $session_id , 
string $session_data )

Writes the session data to the session storage. Called by session_write_close()
, when session_register_shutdown() fails, or during a normal shutdown. Note: 
SessionHandlerInterface::close() is called immediately after this function.

PHP will call this method when the session is ready to be saved and closed. It
encodes the session data from the $_SESSION superglobal to a serialized string
and passes this along with the session ID to this method for storage. The
serialization method used is specified in the session.serialize_handler
setting.

Note this method is normally called by PHP after the output buffers have been
closed unless explicitly called by session_write_close()

参数

session_id

    The session id.

session_data

    The encoded session data. This data is the result of the PHP internally
    encoding the $_SESSION superglobal to a serialized string and passing it as
    this parameter. Please note sessions use an alternative serialization
    method.

返回值

会话存储的返回值（通常成功返回 0，失败返回 1）。

===============================================================================

Note: this function won't be called in case $session_data is unchanged. In
order to call this function every time when session is about closing, add
$_SESSION["timestamp"] = time();

ps_get_buffer — Fetches the full buffer containig the generated PS data

说明

string ps_get_buffer ( resource $psdoc )

This function is not implemented yet. It will always return an empty string.
The idea for a later implementation is to write the contents of the postscript
file into an internal buffer if in memory creation is requested, and retrieve
the buffer content with this function. Currently, documents created in memory
are send to the browser without buffering.

Warning

本函数还未编写文档，仅有参数列表。

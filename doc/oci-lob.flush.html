OCI-Lob::flush

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PECL OCI8 >= 1.1.0)

OCI-Lob::flush — Flushes/writes buffer of the LOB to the server

说明

bool OCI-Lob::flush ([ int $flag ] )

OCI-Lob::flush() actually writes data to the server.

参数

flag

    By default, resources are not freed, but using flag OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE you
    can do it explicitly. Be sure you know what you're doing - next read/write
    operation to the same part of LOB will involve a round-trip to the server
    and initialize new buffer resources. It is recommended to use
    OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE flag only when you are not going to work with the LOB
    anymore.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

Returns FALSE if buffering was not enabled or an error occurred.

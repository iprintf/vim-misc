EventHttpRequest::getBufferEvent — Returns EventBufferEvent object

说明

public EventBufferEvent EventHttpRequest::closeConnection ( void )

Returns EventBufferEvent object which represents buffer event that the
connection is using.

Warning

The reference counter of the returned object will be incremented by one to
protect internal structures against premature destruction when the method is
called from a user callback. So the EventBufferEvent object should be freed
explicitly with EventBufferEvent::free() method. Otherwise memory will leak.

参数

返回值

Returns EventBufferEvent object.

mysqli::prepare -- mysqli_prepare — Prepare an SQL statement for execution

说明

面向对象风格

mysqli_stmt mysqli::prepare ( string $query )

过程化风格

mysqli_stmt mysqli_prepare ( mysqli $link , string $query )

Prepares the SQL query, and returns a statement handle to be used for further
operations on the statement. The query must consist of a single SQL statement.

The parameter markers must be bound to application variables using 
mysqli_stmt_bind_param() and/or mysqli_stmt_bind_result() before executing the
statement or fetching rows.

参数

link

    仅以过程化样式：由mysqli_connect() 或 mysqli_init() 返回的链接标识。

query

    The query, as a string.

        Note:

        You should not add a terminating semicolon or \g to the statement.

    This parameter can include one or more parameter markers in the SQL
    statement by embedding question mark (?) characters at the appropriate
    positions.

        Note:

        The markers are legal only in certain places in SQL statements. For
        example, they are allowed in the VALUES() list of an INSERT statement
        (to specify column values for a row), or in a comparison with a column
        in a WHERE clause to specify a comparison value.

        However, they are not allowed for identifiers (such as table or column
        names), in the select list that names the columns to be returned by a
        SELECT statement, or to specify both operands of a binary operator such
        as the = equal sign. The latter restriction is necessary because it
        would be impossible to determine the parameter type. It's not allowed
        to compare marker with NULL by ? IS NULL too. In general, parameters
        are legal only in Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements, and not
        in Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.

返回值

mysqli_prepare() returns a statement object or FALSE if an error occurred.

Just wanted to make sure that all were aware of get_result.

In the code sample, after execute(), perform a get_result() like this:

<?php

// ... document's example code:

    /* bind parameters for markers */
    $stmt->bind_param("s", $city);

    /* execute query */
    $stmt->execute();

    /* instead of bind_result: */
    $result = $stmt->get_result();

    /* now you can fetch the results into an array - NICE */
    while ($myrow = $result->fetch_assoc()) {

        // use your $myrow array as you would with any other fetch
        printf("%s is in district %s\n", $city, $myrow['district']);

    }
?>

This is much nicer when you have a dozen or more fields coming back from your
query.  Hope this helps.

I wrote this function for my personal use and figured I would share it.  I am
not sure if this is the appropriate forum but I wish I had this when I stumbled
on to mysqli::prepare.  The function is an update of the function I posted
previously.  The previous function could not handle multiple queries.

For queries:
Results of single queries are given as arrays[row#][associated Data Array]
Results of multiple queries are given as arrays[query#][row#][associated Data
Array]

For queries which return an affected row#, affected rows are returned instead
of (array[row#][associated Data Array])

Code and example are below:

<?php
function mysqli_prepared_query($link,$sql,$typeDef = FALSE,$params = FALSE){
  if($stmt = mysqli_prepare($link,$sql)){
    if(count($params) == count($params,1)){
      $params = array($params);
      $multiQuery = FALSE;
    } else {
      $multiQuery = TRUE;
    } 
   
    if($typeDef){
      $bindParams = array();   
      $bindParamsReferences = array();
      $bindParams = array_pad($bindParams,(count($params,1)-count($params))/
count($params),"");        
      foreach($bindParams as $key => $value){
        $bindParamsReferences[$key] = &$bindParams[$key]; 
      }
      array_unshift($bindParamsReferences,$typeDef);
      $bindParamsMethod = new ReflectionMethod('mysqli_stmt', 'bind_param');
      $bindParamsMethod->invokeArgs($stmt,$bindParamsReferences);
    }
   
    $result = array();
    foreach($params as $queryKey => $query){
      foreach($bindParams as $paramKey => $value){
        $bindParams[$paramKey] = $query[$paramKey];
      }
      $queryResult = array();
      if(mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)){
        $resultMetaData = mysqli_stmt_result_metadata($stmt);
        if($resultMetaData){                                                   
                          
          $stmtRow = array();  
          $rowReferences = array();
          while ($field = mysqli_fetch_field($resultMetaData)) {
            $rowReferences[] = &$stmtRow[$field->name];
          }                               
          mysqli_free_result($resultMetaData);
          $bindResultMethod = new ReflectionMethod('mysqli_stmt', 'bind_result'
);
          $bindResultMethod->invokeArgs($stmt, $rowReferences);
          while(mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt)){
            $row = array();
            foreach($stmtRow as $key => $value){
              $row[$key] = $value;          
            }
            $queryResult[] = $row;
          }
          mysqli_stmt_free_result($stmt);
        } else {
          $queryResult[] = mysqli_stmt_affected_rows($stmt);
        }
      } else {
        $queryResult[] = FALSE;
      }
      $result[$queryKey] = $queryResult;
    }
    mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);  
  } else {
    $result = FALSE;
  }
 
  if($multiQuery){
    return $result;
  } else {
    return $result[0];
  }
}
?>

Example(s):
For a table of firstName and lastName:
John Smith
Mark Smith
Jack Johnson
Bob Johnson

<?php
//single query, single result
$query = "SELECT * FROM names WHERE firstName=? AND lastName=?";
$params = array("Bob","Johnson");

mysqli_prepared_query($link,$query,"ss",$params)
/*
returns array(
0=> array('firstName' => 'Bob', 'lastName' => 'Johnson')
)
*/

//single query, multiple results
$query = "SELECT * FROM names WHERE lastName=?";
$params = array("Smith");

mysqli_prepared_query($link,$query,"s",$params)
/*
returns array(
0=> array('firstName' => 'John', 'lastName' => 'Smith')
1=> array('firstName' => 'Mark', 'lastName' => 'Smith')
)
*/

//multiple query, multiple results
$query = "SELECT * FROM names WHERE lastName=?";
$params = array(array("Smith"),array("Johnson"));

mysqli_prepared_query($link,$query,"s",$params)
/*

1=> array('firstName' => 'Bob', 'lastName' => 'Johnson')
)
)
*/

Hope it helps =)
===============================================================================

Note that single-quotes around the parameter markers _will_ prevent your
statement from being prepared correctly.
Ex:

<?php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO City (District) VALUES ('?')");
echo $stmt->param_count." parameters\n";
?>
will print 0 and fail with "Number of variables doesn't match number of
parameters in prepared statement" warning when you try to bind the variables to
it.

But

<?php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO City (District) VALUES (?)");
echo $stmt->param_count." parameters\n";
?>
will print 1 and function correctly.

Very annoying, took me an hour to figure this out.
===============================================================================

The actual purpose to use a prepared statement in sql is to cut the cost of
processing queries; NOT to separate data from query. That's how it's being used
w/ php NOW, not how it was designed to be used in the first place. With SQL you
cut the cost of executing multiple similar queries down by using a prepared
statement.. Doing so cuts out the parsing, validation and most often generates
an execution plan for said query up front. Which is why they run faster in a
loop, than their  IMMEDIATE Query cousins do. Do not assume that just because
someone uses php and this function this way does not mean that it is THE way,
or only way to do it. Although it is more secure than general queries but they
are also more limited in what they can do or more precisely how you can go
about doing it.
===============================================================================

When executing a prepared MySQL, by default if there's an error then you'll
simply get FALSE returned from your call to prepare().

To get the full MySQL error back create a statement object before preparing
your query as such:

<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

/* check connection */
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

$city = "Amersfoort";

/* create a prepared statement */
$statement = $mysqli->stmt_init();
if ($statement->prepare("SELECT District FROM City WHERE Name=?")) {

    /* bind parameters for marker(s) */
    $statement->bind_param("s", $city);

    /* execute query */
    if (!$statement->execute()) {
        trigger_error('Error executing MySQL query: ' . $statement->error);
    }

    /* bind result variables */
    $statement->bind_result($district);

    /* fetch value */
    $statement->fetch();

    printf("%s is in district %s\n", $city, $district);

    /* close statement */
    $statement->close();
}

/* close connection */
$mysqli->close();
?>
===============================================================================

The purpose of prepared statements is to not include data in your SQL
statements. Including them in your SQL statements is NOT safe. Always use
prepared statements. They are cleaner to use (code easier to read) and not
prone to SQL injections.

Escaping strings to include in SQL statements doesn't work very well in some
locales hence it is not safe.
===============================================================================

Performance note to those who wonder. I performed a test where first of all
inserted about 30,000 posts with one PK:id and a varchar(20), where the varchar
data was md5-hash for the current iterator value just to fill with some data.

The test was performed on a dedicated ubuntu 7.04 server with apache2/php5/
mysql5.0 running on Athlon 64 - 3000+ with 512MB of RAM. The queries where
tested with a for-loop from 0 to 30000 first with:

<?php
for ( $i = 0; $i <= 30000; ++$i )
{
    $result = $mysqli->query("SELECT * FROM test WHERE id = $i");
    $row = $result->fetch_row();
    echo $row[0]; //prints id
}
?>

which gave a page-load time of about 3.3seconds avarage, then with this loop:

<?php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM test WHERE id = ?");
for ( $i = 0; $i <= 30000; ++$i )
{
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $i);
    $stmt->execute();
    $stmt->bind_result($id, $md5);
    $stmt->fetch();
    echo $id;
}
$stmt->close();
?>

and the avarage page-load was lowered by 1.3sec, which means about 2.0 sec
avarage! Guess the performance difference could be even greater on a more
complex/larger table and more complex SQL-queries.
===============================================================================

I don't think this is a bug, just an unexpected behavior.  While building an
API I discovered that passing INT 0 instead of STRING '0' into a prepared
statement caused my script to run out of memory and produce a 500error on the
webpage.

A simplified example of this issue is below: ($_DB is a global reference to a
mysqli connection)

<?php
function getItem( $ID ) {

     $_STATEMENT = $_DB->prepare("SELECT item_user, item_name, item_description
FROM item WHERE item_id = ?;");

     $_STATEMENT->bind_param( 'i' , $ID );

     $_STATEMENT->execute();
     $_STATEMENT->store_result();

     $_STATEMENT->bind_result( $user , $name , $description);
     $result = $_STATEMENT->fetch();

     $_STATEMENT->free_result();
     $_STATEMENT->close();

     return $result;
}

getItem(0); //fails!
getItem('0'); //works!

?>

The best I can guess is that an INT 0 gets translated as BOOLEAN , and if this
is indeed the case it should be documented above, but all efforts to get error
information (via the php script) have failed.
===============================================================================

For those learning mysqli::prepare and mysqli_stmt::bind_params for the first
time, here is a commented block of code which executes prepared queries and
returns data in a similar format to the return values of mysqli_query.  I tried
to minimize unnecessary classes, objects, or overhead for two reasons:
1) facilitate learning
2) allow relativity interchangeable use with mysqli_query

My goal is to lower the learning curve for whoever is starting out with these
family of functions.  I am by no means an expert coder/scripter, so I am sure
there are improvements and perhaps a few bugs, but I hope not =)

Here's hoping the PHP gods don't smite me.
===============================================================================

I don't think these are good examples, because the primary use of prepared
queries is when you are going to call the same query in a loop, plugging in
different values each time.  For instance, if you were generating a report and
needed to run the same query for each line, tweaking the values in the WHERE
clause, or importing data from another system.
===============================================================================

There is no reference that all data must be fetched before a new prepare call
to msqli, the only help is in a 6 years old comment!
You have to myslqi_stmt::fetch() data until NULL is returned before you can
call mysqli::prepare() again without having FALSE and no error at all in
mysqli::$errno and mysqli::$error
===============================================================================

I don't know how obvious this was for anyone else, but if you attempt to
prepare a query for a table that doesn't exist in the database the connection
currently points to (or if your query is invalid in some other way, I suppose),
an object will not be returned. I only noticed this after doing some digging
when I kept getting a fatal error saying that my statement variable was not an
set to an instance of an object (it was probably null).

Replace NOSPAM with nimblepros to e-mail me.
===============================================================================

All data must be fetched before a new statement prepare
===============================================================================

Here is an example using bind_param and bind_result, showing iteration over a
list of cities.

Note that there's some bug-potential in cases where the query returns NULL for
some parameter value,
but the bind_result variables still might be bound.  So, we use a conditional
to spray the spot first.

$mysqli->select_db("world");

$template = "SELECT District, CountryCode FROM City WHERE Name=?";
printf("Prepare statement from template: %s\n",  $template);

$cities = array('San Francisco', 'Lisbon', 'Lisboa', 'Marrakech', 'Madrid');
printf("Cities: %s\n", join(':', $cities));

if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare($template)) {

   foreach($cities as $city) {
     // bind the string $city to the '?'
     $stmt->bind_param("s", $city);
     $stmt->execute();
     // bind result variables
     $stmt->bind_result($d,$cc);
     // 'Lisbon' is not found in the world.City table, but 'Lisboa' is.
     // Using a conditional we avoid putting Lisbon in California.
     if($stmt->fetch()) {
       printf("%s is in  %s, %s\n", $city, $d, $cc);
     }

   }
   $stmt->close();
}

With the conditional statement we get the desired result:

Prepare statement from template: SELECT District,CountryCode FROM City WHERE
Name=?
Cities: San Francisco:Lisbon:Lisboa:Marrakech:Madrid

San Francisco is in  California, USA
Lisboa is in  Lisboa, PRT
Marrakech is in  Marrakech-Tensift-Al, MAR
Madrid is in  Madrid, ESP

But, without the conditional statement we would put Lisbon in California:

San Francisco is in  California, USA
Lisbon is in  California, USA
Lisboa is in  Lisboa, PRT
Marrakech is in  Marrakech-Tensift-Al, MAR
Madrid is in  Madrid, ESP
===============================================================================

Prepared statements are confusing in the beginning ..

mysqli->prepare() returns a so-called statement object which is used for
subsequent operations eg execute, bind_param, store_result, bind_result, fetch,
etc.

The statement object has private properties which update as each statement
operation is carried out. I found these useful for understanding what is going
on when writing a prepared statement function:

affected_rows
insert_id
num_rows
param_count
field_count
errno
error
sqlstate
id

But it took a little time to get my head around accessing them:

<?php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($query);

//       .. $stmt-> operations ..

var_dump($stmt); // shows null values

var_dump($stmt->errno); // note literal, displays value

//       .. $stmt-> operations ..

// to keep a copy ..
// get_object_properties() won't work
// clone() won't work
$properties = array();
foreach ($stmt as $name => $priv){
    $properties[$name] = $stmt->$name; //    works
    // $properties[$name] = $priv; //    won't work, foreach can't access
private properties
}

$stmt->close();
// var_dump($stmt->errno) // won't work, $stmt is closed
?>
===============================================================================

I think that the purpose that it was originally built for, and the purpose that
people use it for today, have diverged.  But why dwell on the original purpose?
  Obviously more code has been put into prepared statements today to allow it
to be used to prevent sql injections, so it is now part of the design purpose
today, as well as performance on repeatable statements.
===============================================================================

If your IDE isn't recognizing $stmt as an object of type mysqli_stmt when you
use the traditional perpare:

$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, $query);

The following works and is IDE friendly:

$stmt = new mysqli_stmt($link, $query);
===============================================================================

Actually, the purpose of a prepare statement is to separate user input from SQL
commands.  This increases security by preventing a user from executing his own
SQL code and damaging the integrity of a database.
===============================================================================

It's worth noting that this function will error out with "Number of variables
doesn't match number of parameters in prepared statement" for reasons that have
nothing to do with the number of variables and parameters.

For example, I made the newbie mistake of saying "SELECT (username, password)
FROM mytable WHERE something = ?" instead of "SELECT username, password FROM
mytable WHERE something = ?" and got that error.

So basically, if you get that error, check your query syntax very carefully
before poking around for the various problems that could occur with binding,
pass-by-reference, etc.
===============================================================================

Don't let yourself be bullied into using prepared statements. There's nothing
wrong with using them, but regular queries also have their benefits. Namely
prepared statements are perfect for queries that you need to execute in a loop,
while regular queries are faster for queries that execute once per script
execution and are just as safe if you are properly sanitizing your data with
mysqli_real_escape_string().
===============================================================================

It must be noted in the Description whether developers should call
mysqli_stmt_close prior to executing mysqli_prepare again on the same statement
variable.

Example, Script A calls mysqli_stmt_close twice:
<?php
/* Script A -- We are already connected to the database */

$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, "INSERT INTO table VALUES (?, ?, 100)"); /* Query
1 */
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "si", $string, $integer);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_close($stmt); // CLOSE $stmt

$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, "INSERT INTO table VALUES ('PHP', ?, ?)"); /*
Query 2 */
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ii", $integer, $code);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_close($stmt); // CLOSE $stmt

/* Script A -- Continues on... */
?>

Next, we have Script B, calling mysqli_prepare again before issuing
mysqli_stmt_close on the prior statement.
<?php
/* Script B -- We are already connected to the database */

$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, "INSERT INTO table VALUES (?, ?, 100)"); /* Query
1 */
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "si", $string, $integer);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

$stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, "INSERT INTO table VALUES ('PHP', ?, ?)"); /*
Query 2 */
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ii", $integer, $code);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

mysqli_stmt_close($stmt); // CLOSE $stmt

/* Script B -- Continues on... */
?>

Which method is more efficient and should be used by developers?

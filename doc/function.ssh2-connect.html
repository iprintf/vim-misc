ssh2_connect — Connect to an SSH server

说明

resource ssh2_connect ( string $host [, int $port = 22 [, array $methods [, 
array $callbacks ]]] )

Establish a connection to a remote SSH server.

Once connected, the client should verify the server's hostkey using 
ssh2_fingerprint(), then authenticate using either password or public key.

Due to a lack of complete examples, here's a simple SSH2 class for connecting
to a server, authenticating with public key authentication, verifying the
server's fingerprint, issuing commands and reading their STDOUT and properly
disconnecting.  Note: You may need to make sure you commands produce output so
the response can be pulled.  Some people suggest that the command is not
executed until you pull the response back.

Be careful when providing a specific hostkey order.

<?php
ssh2_connect('IP', 'port', array('hostkey'=>'ssh-rsa, ssh-dss'));
?>

Will only work when the public key of the server is RSA, and not DSA also as
expected. This is caused by the empty space before the "ssh-dss".

So a similar code:

<?php
ssh2_connect('IP', 'port',   array('hostkey'=>'ssh-rsa,ssh-dss'));
?>

Will work. The HOSTKEY method is overriden using exactly what you write, so no
empty spaces are allowed.

This took me some time that you could save ;)
===============================================================================

Warning! If you open a ssh connection and execute an external program opening
another ssh connection it may result in very strange behavior.

I used an sftp connection to get a file list and used "exec" to download the
files afterwards with an external sftp. lftp downloaded zeros with no comment,
psftp exits with error code 11 most of the time, but sometimes it works -
probably depending on how quickly php collects garbage and closes the unused
connection first.

As there is no function to close a connection, you need to be sure to destroy
all references (unset) to close it.
===============================================================================

Hi,
If you are having problems with running a ssh2 session and it waits forever
during the execution of stream_get_contents, it might be because the remote
system has run the command and is now sitting at a # prompt waiting for the
next command.  I had this issue on a HP MSA box, here is the code to get around
the issue.

Assuming you are connected with your authentication method and $ssh contains
the handle.

<?php
$command = "check disk";
// Open a nice large window to stop wrapping
$stream = ssh2_shell ($ssh, 'xterm', null, 200, 200, SSH2_TERM_UNIT_CHARS);

// Hook into the error stream
$errorStream = ssh2_fetch_stream($stream, SSH2_STREAM_STDERR); 

// Block the streams so we wait until they complete
stream_set_blocking ($stream, true);
stream_set_blocking($errorStream, true);

// Send the commands to the terminal
fwrite ($stream, $command . PHP_EOL );

// Wait give the terminal a chance to accept and start processing the command,
this is a slow storage device after all
sleep(2);

// IMPORTANT BIT!!  Send exit to the terminal to close the connection BEFORE WE
WAIT FOR THE STREAM
fwrite ($stream, "exit" . PHP_EOL );
sleep (2);

// Print the output
echo stream_get_contents($stream);
$errortext=stream_get_contents($errorStream);

if (strlen($errortext) > 0) {
          // Error Data
         echo "Error Data: $errortext";
         exit (1);
}

// All Good
exit (0);

?>

You can't use ssh2_exec with this method (well at lease I couldn't) because on
executing the first command the stream gets blocked and then you can't run the
exit command, whereas a terminal seems to use one session.

I hope this helps someone.

With Sara's help, I have the following SS2 class that is quite flexible. If
anyone improves it, please feel free to let me know.

<?php

  function __construct($host='', $port=''  ) {

     if( $host!='' ) $this->host  = $host;
     if( $port!='' ) $this->port  = $port;

     $this->con  = ssh2_connect($this->host, $this->port);
     if( !$this->con ) {
       $this->log .= "Connection failed !";
     }

  }

  function authPassword( $user = '', $password = '' ) {

ldap_connect — Connect to an LDAP server

说明

resource ldap_connect ([ string $host = NULL [, int $port = 389 ]] )

Creates an LDAP link identifier and checks whether the given host and port are
plausible.

Note: This function does not open a connection. It checks whether the given
parameters are plausibe and can be used to open a connection as soon as one is
needed.

参数

host

    This field supports using a hostname or, with OpenLDAP 2.x.x and later, a
    full LDAP URI of the form ldap://hostname:port or ldaps://hostname:port for
    SSL encryption.

    You can also provide multiple LDAP-URIs separated by a space as one string

    Note that hostname:port is not a supported LDAP URI as the schema is
    missing.

port

    The port to connect to. Not used when using LDAP URIs.

返回值

Returns a positive LDAP link identifier when the provided hostname/port
combination or LDAP URI seems plausible. It's a syntactic check of the provided
parameters but the server(s) will not be contacted! If the syntactic check
fails it returns FALSE. When OpenLDAP 2.x.x is used, ldap_connect() will always
return a resource as it does not actually connect but just initializes the
connecting parameters. The actual connect happens with the next calls to ldap_*
funcs, usually with ldap_bind().

If no arguments are specified then the link identifier of the already opened
link will be returned.

If you don't want your PHP program to wait XXX seconds before giving up in a
case when one of your corporate DC have failed, and since ldap_connect() does
not have a mechanism to timeout on a user specified time, this is my workaround
which shows excellent practical results.

===========================================================
function serviceping($host, $port=389, $timeout=1)
{
        $op = fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, $timeout);
        if (!$op) return 0; //DC is N/A
    else {
    fclose($opanak); //explicitly close open socket connection
    return 1; //DC is up & running, we can safely connect with ldap_connect
    }
}

// ##### STATIC DC LIST, if your DNS round robin is not setup
//$dclist = array('10.111.222.111', '10.111.222.100', '10.111.222.200');

// ##### DYNAMIC DC LIST, reverse DNS lookup sorted by round-robin result
$dclist = gethostbynamel('domain.name');

foreach ($dclist as $k => $dc) if (serviceping($dc) == true) break; else $dc =
0;
//after this loop, either there will be at least one DC which is available at
present, or $dc would return bool false while the next line stops program from
further execution

if (!$dc) exit("NO DOMAIN CONTROLLERS AVAILABLE AT PRESENT, PLEASE TRY AGAIN
LATER!"); //user being notified

//now, ldap_connect would certainly connect succesfully to DC tested previously
and no timeout will occur
$ldapconn = ldap_connect($dc) or die("DC N/A, PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.");
===========================================================

Also with this approach, you get a real nice failover functionality, take for
an example a company with a dozen of DC-a distributed along distant places,
this way your PHP program will always have high availability if at least one DC
is active at present.
===============================================================================

To be able to make modifications to Active Directory via the LDAP connector you
must bind to the LDAP service over SSL. Otherwise Active Directory provides a
mostly readonly connection. You cannot add objects or modify certain properties
without LDAPS, e.g. passwords can only be changed using LDAPS connections to
Active Directory.

Therefore, for those wishing to securely connect to Active Directory, from a
Unix host using PHP+OpenLDAP+OpenSSL I spent some time getting this going
myself, and came across a few gotcha's. Hope this proves fruitfull for others
like me when you couldn't find answers out there.

Make sure you compile OpenLDAP with OpenSSL support, and that you compile PHP
with OpenLDAP and OpenSSL.

This provides PHP with what it needs to make use of ldaps:// connections.

Configure OpenSSL:

Extract your Root CA certificate from Active Directory, this is achived through
the use of Certificate Services, a startard component of Windows 2000 Server,
but may not be installed by default, (The usual Add/Remove Software method will
work here). I extracted this in Base64 not DER format.

Place the extracted CAcert into the certs folder for openssl. (e.g. /usr/local/
ssl/certs) and setup the hashed symlinks. This is easily done by simply
running:

  /usr/local/ssl/bin/c_rehash

Once this is done you can test it is worked by running:

  /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl verify -verbose -CApath /usr/local/ssl/certs /tmp/
exported_cacert.pem

(Should return: OK).

Configure OpenLDAP:

Add the following to your ldap.conf file.
(found as /usr/local/openldap/etc/openldap/ldap.conf)

  #--begin--

  # Instruct client to NOT request a server's cert.
  TLS_REQCERT never

  # Define location of CA Cert
  TLS_CACERT /usr/local/ssl/certs/AD_CA_CERT.pem
  TLS_CACERTDIR /usr/local/ssl/certs

  #--end--

You also need to place those same settings in a file within the Apache Web user
homedir called .ldaprc

  e.g.:
 
  cp /usr/local/openldap/etc/openldap/ldap.conf ~www/.ldaprc )

You can then test that you're able to establish a LDAPS connection to Active
Directory from the OpenLDAP command tools:

  /usr/local/openldap/bin/ldapsearch -H "ldaps://adserver.ad.com"

This should return some output in extended LDIF format and will indicate no
matching objects, but it proves the connection works.

The name of the server you're connecting to is important. If they server name
you specify in the "ldaps://" URI does not match the name of the server in it's
certificate, it will complain like so:

  ldap_bind: Can't contact LDAP server (81)
        additional info: TLS: hostname does not match CN in peer certificate

Once you've gotten the ldapsearch tool working correctly PHP should work also.

One important gotcha however is that the Web user must be able to locate it's
HOME folder. You must check that Apache is providing a HOME variable set to the
Web users home directory, so that php can locate the .ldaprc file and the
settings contained within. This may well be different between Unix variants but
it is such a simple and stupid thing if you miss it and it causes you grief.
Simply use a SetEnv directive in Apache's httpd.conf:

  SetEnv HOME /usr/local/www

With all that done, you can now code up a simple connect function:

  function connect_AD()
  {
    $ldap_server = "ldaps://adserver.ad.com" ;
    $ldap_user   = "CN=web service account,OU=Service Accounts,DC=ad,DC=com" ;
    $ldap_pass   = "password" ;

    $ad = ldap_connect($ldap_server) ;
    ldap_set_option($ad, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3) ;
    $bound = ldap_bind($ad, $ldap_user, $ldap_pass);

    return $ad ;
  }

Optionally you can avoid the URI style server string and use something like
ldap_connect("adserver.ad.com", 636) ;  But work fine with Active Directory
servers.

Hope this proves usefull.
===============================================================================

In order to connect to an ldap server via ssl I needed to use a certificate.
For this to work the ldap admin sent me a .der file which I put into /etc/
openldap/cacerts.
    cp ldap-server.der /etc/openldap/cacerts
That directory must be chmod 755. Then the following entries had to be in /etc/
openldap/ldap.conf
    TLS_REQCERT   never 
    TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/openldap/cacerts
"TLS_REQCERT never" should only be required if there is a self-signed
certificate in the certificate chain.
===============================================================================

Note that hostname can be a space-separated list of LDAP host names. This is
very useful for failover; if the first ldap host is down, ldap_connect will ask
the second LDAP host. Of course, you _must_ have LDAP replicates before doing
this. :) Read the LDAP API documentation for more information.

This can also be useful, apart from failover, for LDAP load balancing. Just use
a random generator function that will return a different space-separated list
every time. This is because the first host in the list is always tried first.

Be careful when doing LDAP writes; be sure to always connect to your master
host when you are about to modify the database, so that the replicates will get
the changes as expected.

I have spent a lot of time to make an LDAPS connection to a MS AD Global
Catalog port 3269

My five Cents:

ldap_connect("ldaps://example.com", 3269)
=> Connection to 636.... :(, DC only

ldap_connect("ldaps://example.com:3269")
=> Connection to 3269.... :), GC as expected

May it helps...
===============================================================================

I sure do wish there was some way I could get this information out to all
programmers in the world about binding and searching MS AD.  This is the second
time I was bit by the "I need to search the entire tree" problem.

For php (and apache auth_ldap ) you need to specify port 3268 when you want to
search the entire tree.  Otherwise it will spit out the partial results error.

ldap_connect($server,3268);

I'm just fortunate enough to have won this same battle with apache searching
the whole directory.  When I noticed our php application failing auth's for
users, I was immediately able to fix the problem by adding this port
specification (and the ldap_set_option($ldapserver, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0) 
option).

I really hope this helps someone else before they pull all their hair out.  I
know I miss mine.
===============================================================================

It bears repeating (and the examples should probably be updated) that
ldap_connect() doesn't actually test the connection to the specified ldap
server. This is important if you're trying to build failover into your
ldap-based authentication routine.

The only way to test the connection is to actually call ldap_bind( $ds,
$username, $password ). But if that fails, is it because you have the wrong
username/password or is it because the connection is down? As far as I can see
there isn't any way to tell.

It seems that if ldap_bind() fails against your primary server, you have no
choice but to try ldap_bind() with the same credentials against the backup. And
yet, if your organization limits failed login attempts, a single bad password
counts as two failed login attempts. Not good.

One possible workaround is to try an anonymous bind first:

<?php
// connect to primary
$ds = ldap_connect( 'ldap://10.0.0.7/' );
// note: $ds is always a resource even if primary is down

// try anonymous login to test connection
$anon = @ldap_bind( $ds );
if ( !$anon ) {
    // test failed, connect to failover host
    $ds = ldap_connect( 'ldap://10.0.0.8/' );
}
else {
    // test passed, unbind anonymous and reconnect to primary
    ldap_unbind( $ds );
    $ds = ldap_connect( 'ldap://10.0.0.7/' );
}

// now try a real login
$login = @ldap_bind( $ds, $username, $password );
?>

Note that this workaround relies on anonymous login being enabled, which may
not always be the case. It's a little sad that there is no other way to test
the connection. Hopefully this can be remedied in some future implementation of
ldap_connect().

Hello,

Little corrections to nemanja  post.
- There was a warning if connection is denied by firewall (adding @ before
fsockopen)
- fclose parameter was incorrect.

With this approach, you get a real nice failover functionality, take for an
example a company with a dozen of DC-a distributed along distant places, this
way your PHP program will always have high availability if at least one DC is
active at present.
<?php
function serviceping($_host, $_port = 389, $_timeout = 1) {
    $op = @fsockopen($_host, $_port, $errno, $errstr, $_timeout);
    if (!$op) {
        echo "KO!";
        return 0;
       
    } //DC is N/A
    else {
        fclose($op); //explicitly close open socket connection
        return 1; //DC is up & running, we can safely connect with ldap_connect
    }
}

function ldap_connect_failover($_domain) {
// ##### STATIC DC LIST, if your DNS round robin is not setup
//$dclist = array('10.111.222.111', '10.111.222.100', '10.111.222.200');
// ##### DYNAMIC DC LIST, reverse DNS lookup sorted by round-robin result
    $dclist = gethostbynamel($_domain);

    foreach ($dclist as $dc) {
        if (serviceping($dc) == true) {
            break;
        } else {
            $dc = 0;
        }
    }
//after this loop, either there will be at least one DC which is available at
present, or $dc would return bool false while the next line stops program from
further execution

    if (!$dc) {
        return false;
    } //user being notified

    return ldap_connect($dc);
}
?>
===============================================================================

A resource ID is always returned when using URLs for the host parameter
even if the host does not exist.

"When using an URI to describe the connection, the (open)ldap library
only parses the url and checks if it's valid, _no connection_ is
established in that case."

To use LDAPS on Windows whitout "c:\openldap\sysconf\ldap.conf":
Generate a file like ldap.conf, name it "ldaprc".
For PHP script running on command line put the file to the script.
For PHP script running on webserver put the file in home directory of PHP.
===============================================================================

To override the ssl ca file can be done by setting an environmental variable
within php.

I found using saving the ca certificate (and intermediate ca's) to a file
called ca.pem and then adding

putenv('LDAPTLS_CACERT=./ca.pem');

before ldap_connect works for me.  
Code example:
<?php
putenv('LDAPTLS_CACERT=./ca.pem');
ldap_set_option(NULL, LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL, 7);
$l = ldap_connect("ldaps://ldap/");
ldap_set_option($l, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
ldap_bind($l, "cn=apache,dc=example", "xxxxxxx");
echo(ldap_error($l)."\n");
$s = ldap_search($l, "dc=example", "uid=test");
echo(ldap_count_entries($l, $s)."\n");
?>
in the file  ca.pem in the same directory we have our ca's:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<cert here>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
===============================================================================

The host name parameter can be a space separated list of host names. This means
that the LDAP code will talk to a backup server if the main server is not
operational. There will be a delay while the code times out trying to talk to
the main server but things will still work. This is particularly useful with a
typical Microsoft Active Directory setup of primary and backup domain
controllers.
<?php
$ldaphost = "192.168.0.100 192.168.0.101";
$ldapconn = ldap_connect($ldaphost);
?>
===============================================================================

I support a LAMP stack with PHP-FPM on CentOS 7 that needs to connect to Active
Directory over SSL.  We have a root certificate for the domain.  I was able to
set this up in five steps.

1. Get the domain's root SSL certificate in base64. (Must be an Enterprise
Administrator - talk with your admin if you are not one.)
Run mmc.exe
File -> Add/Remove Snap-in
Select Certification Authority, then the server that generates certificates for
your domain.
Expand the tree until you find the entry for the root certificate, then right
click->Properties.
Click the "View Certificate" button, The "Details" tab, then the "Copy to
File..." button.
Use the wizard to export the root certificate to your computer. Ensure you use
the Base-64 format.

2. Copy the root cert to the Linux server.  You can open the certificate in
notepad and copy and paste the contents.

3. Convert the certificate to pem format.  Substitute the names of files as
needed.
openssl x509 -in <copied certificate file> -out /etc/openldap/certs/<cert>.pem

4. Add a line in ldap.conf to use new root cert.
vi /etc/openldap/ldap.conf
TLS_CACERT      /etc/openldap/certs/<cert>.pem

5.Restart the PHP service.
systemctl restart php-fpm.service
===============================================================================

If you have oci8 and are trying to use openldap for ldap you *may* run into a
problem.  I have an Oracle database that I connect to from apache.  Oracle also
has ldap libs which were taking precedence over the openldap libs.  This would
cause a seg fault when calling ldap_connect with a uri style connect string;
e.g. ldap_connect("ldaps://myldapserver.host");

After using gdb to debug a core dump and a lot of googling I found that the
solution was to add an env-var to apachectl startup.

I am using Apache 2.2.8 with PHP 5.2.5 on RHEL.  I added:

LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libldap.so
export LD_PRELOAD

in /usr/sbin/envvars which is read when apachectl starts.  You can read more on
this here: http://www.mail-archive.com/php-bugs@lists.php.net/msg02201.html

Everyone is posting about getting ldaps:// working in a WAMP/AD stack, I had a
tough time finding how to get it going in RHEL 5.1 (w/ all stock rpms).  Good
old strace did the trick and helped me find the problem...

Turns out php was looking for the CA file in /etc/pki/CA, and I didn't have the
correct permissions on the folder.  chmod'ing it to 755 solved my "Can't
contact LDAP server" message.
===============================================================================

Be careful when using ldap_connect with the sun client libraries that come
bundled with solaris.   When specifyng the host with the ldap protocol, my
connection failed and it took me a good day to trouble shoot.  ie. ldap_connect
("ldap://somwhere.com");  Just remove the 'ldap://' and specify the host.  
This was on Solaris 10 sparc.
===============================================================================

The previous note concerning searching the whole AD tree works fully. Though
you must be sure that the server you're authenticating/searching is a Global
Catalog server. If not, connecting and binding will fail. Usually there is at
least one Global Catalog server in your domain, so if the connect fails try
another server it will work. The reason it works is that the Global Catalog
server searches the whole domain as where the domain catalog only searches a
given OU, offcourse this opposes a security threat as well :)...
===============================================================================

Be careful about the certificate's permission if you are using Windows.

Set certificates' permissions for everyone to Read and Read&Execute or you may
get binding errors because of this.
===============================================================================

This code sample shows how to connect and bind to eDirectory in PHP using LDAP
for Netware.

<?php

$server='137.65.138.159';
$admin='cn=admin,o=novell';
$passwd='novell';

$ds=ldap_connect($server);  // assuming the LDAP server is on this host

if ($ds) {
    // bind with appropriate dn to give update access
    $r=ldap_bind($ds, $admin, $passwd);
    if(!$r) die("ldap_bind failed<br>");

    echo "ldap_bind success";
    ldap_close($ds);
} else {
    echo "Unable to connect to LDAP server";
}
?>
===============================================================================

Using LDAP over SSL on NetWare:

1. Copy the server certificates to sys:/php5/cert directory. This location is
configurable in php.ini file.

2. Use "ldaps://" prefix for host name argument or a value of 636 for port
number argument in ldap_connect call.

For more details, visit, NetWare specific PHP documentation at http://
developer.novell.com/ndk/doc/php/index.html
===============================================================================

As mentioned above, openLDAP will always return a resource, even if the server
name isn't valid. 

If you then bind with errors suppressed (@ldap_bind) and it fails, it's not
obvious what caused the failure (ie: connection or credentials).  As the bind
doesn't return a resource you can't get the last error from ldap_error etc.
either.

If you display just a message about login failure to the user they may get
frustrated re-typing a valid username/password when it's the connection that's
at fault.
===============================================================================

To complete questions about how to connect to a LDAP ACTIVE DIRECTORY 2000/2003
server with SASL on port 636, you can refer to prevous notes, and the following
directives:

A)Create CA certificates from AD;
B)Export in .pem (DER) format;
C)Install OPENSSL,CYRUS SASL,OPENLDAP,KERBEROS 5;
D)Copy exported AD ca cert into openssl certs dir on your unix system;
E)Reash with c_reash command;
F)Get a kerberos ticket form AD for your user;
G)Compile PHP with SSL and LDAP support;
H)Test with ldapsearch -D <binddn> -W -H ldaps://ad.secure.com:636 -x

If all works right, create your php script.

Note: For writing parameters to AD you need to renew ticket each 10 hours or
less (AD default lifetime ticket), for reading pourpose you can maintain
expired ticket.
When querying a windows 2000/2003 AD you MUST use only SASL and not TLS (non
supported).
===============================================================================

I have spent hours and hours trying to get an LDAPS connection happening with
my local AD LDS instance (running on Windows 8.1 64bit).

I tried certificate after certificate. OpenSSL, Thawte and Self-signed - all
with no success.

I ended up deleting all of my certificates and created a Self-signed
certificate using IIS 7 (running on Windows 8.1).

I then downloaded the Softerra LDAP browser and it was able to connect to my AD
LDS instance via SSL with no problems.

Sure if it could PHP could.

I used the following code to connect:
<?php
$ldap_server = "ldaps://delllappy:636";
$ldap_conn = ldap_connect($ldap_server)  or die("Failed to connect to LDAP
server.");
?>
I added the following above the ldap_connect:
<?php
putenv('LDAPTLS_REQCERT=allow');
putenv("LDAPCONF=C:\OpenLDAP\sysconf\ldap.conf");
?>

That did nothing.

The ldap_bind command I used was:
<?php
if (!ldap_bind($ldap_conn, $ldap_user, $ldap_pass)) {
    echo "error";
}else{
    echo "success";
}
?>
BTW: I added a heap of debug in the code too - which is referenced elsewhere -
so I didn't add it in here.

The error that I kept on getting was:
Error Binding to LDAP: error:14090086:SSL
routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

I then ran ProcMon (Process Monitor from Microsoft).

I monitored when I restarted my web server (Z-WAMP). At that point there was no
attempt to read ldap.conf.

I then loaded up my web page with my test.php file.

At that point I noticed that it was ldap.conf that was being read but
openldap.conf.

Of course as my file was called ldap.conf, openldap.conf failed. I renamed my
ldap.conf to openldap.conf and everything worked.

On Z-WAMP running OpenLDAP don't used ldap.conf, use openldap.conf.

The openldap.conf file was placed in C:\openldap\sysconf\.

As the PUTENV values did not do anything, I removed them.
===============================================================================

An addition to trying to setup failover. After doing the ldap_connect, do the
ldap_bind.  If ldap_bind fails, use the command ldap_errno to get the error
number.  If the error number is 81, that represents the server is down.  That
is the only time we do a failover to our backup ldap server.

Another thing to consider is the error could be 49, then do
ldap_get_option($this->ds,LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER,$optErrorNumber);. This will
return extended data and if the data code in that is 532 or 773, the bind
failure will be caused by the password being expired and requiring a password
update before the bind will succeed.
===============================================================================

PHP:LDAP does not support persistent connections.
===============================================================================

I had terrible problems with "Unable to bind to server: Invalid credentials"
error - everything seemed to be OK (login/pwd used in other apps).
Solved by adding domain to login (instead "username" I used
"username@example.com").

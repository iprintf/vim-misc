预定义常量

MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_PRIMARY

    All operations read from the current replica set primary. This is the
    default read preference for MongoDB.

MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_PRIMARY_PREFERRED

    In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it is
    unavailable, operations read from secondary members.

MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_SECONDARY

    All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.

MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_SECONDARY_PREFERRED

    In most situations, operations read from secondary members but if no
    secondary members are available, operations read from the primary.

MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_NEAREST

    Operations read from member of the replica set with the least network
    latency, irrespective of the member's type.

sqlsrv_free_stmt — Frees all resources for the specified statement

说明

bool sqlsrv_free_stmt ( resource $stmt )

Frees all resources for the specified statement. The statement cannot be used
after sqlsrv_free_stmt() has been called on it. If sqlsrv_free_stmt() is called
on an in-progress statement that alters server state, statement execution is
terminated and the statement is rolled back.

参数

stmt

    The statment for which resources are freed. Note that NULL is a valid
    parameter value. This allows the function to be called multiple times in a
    script.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 sqlsrv_free_stmt() example

<?php
$serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress";
$connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName", "UID"=>"username", "PWD"=>
"password");
$conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);
if( $conn === false ) {
     die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
}

$stmt = sqlsrv_query( $conn, "SELECT * FROM Table_1");
if( $stmt === false ) {
     die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
}

/*-------------------------------
     Process query results here.
-------------------------------*/

/* Free the statement resources. */
sqlsrv_free_stmt( $stmt);

?>

注释

The main difference between sqlsrv_free_stmt() and sqlsrv_cancel() is that a
statement resource cancelled with sqlsrv_cancel() can be re-executed if it was
created with sqlsrv_prepare(). A statement resource cancelled with 
sqlsrv_free_statement() cannot be re-executed.

===============================================================================

If you accidentally call this with an invalid $stmt resource, you may see
unexpected fatal errors.

I had left behind a call here when cleaning up some code and this caused the my
IIS server to generate an error 500 resource not found error.  Furthermore it
seemed to only affect some users and not all and I could not isolate why only
selected users got the error when it was called for all users.

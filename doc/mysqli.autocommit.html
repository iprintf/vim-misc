mysqli::autocommit

mysqli_autocommit

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

mysqli::autocommit -- mysqli_autocommit — 打开或关闭本次数据库连接的自动命令提
交事务模式

说明

面向对象风格

bool mysqli::autocommit ( bool $mode )

过程化风格

bool mysqli_autocommit ( mysqli $link , bool $mode )

打开或关闭本次数据库连接的自动命令提交事务模式。

如需要确认当前连接的自动事务提交状态，可执行这个SQL请求SELECT @@autocommit.

参数

link

    仅以过程化样式：由mysqli_connect() 或 mysqli_init() 返回的链接标识。

mode

    Whether to turn on auto-commit or not.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

注释

    Note:

    这个方法不会在不支持事务处理的表单查询中生效，如MyISAM或 ISAM。

范例

Example #1 mysqli::autocommit() example

面向对象风格

<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

/* turn autocommit on */
$mysqli->autocommit(TRUE);

if ($result = $mysqli->query("SELECT @@autocommit")) {
    $row = $result->fetch_row();
    printf("Autocommit is %s\n", $row[0]);
    $result->free();
}

/* close connection */
$mysqli->close();
?>

过程化风格

<?php
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");

if (!$link) {
    printf("Can't connect to localhost. Error: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error());
    exit();
}

/* turn autocommit on */
mysqli_autocommit($link, TRUE);

if ($result = mysqli_query($link, "SELECT @@autocommit")) {
    $row = mysqli_fetch_row($result);
    printf("Autocommit is %s\n", $row[0]);
    mysqli_free_result($result);
}

/* close connection */
mysqli_close($link);
?>

以上例程会输出：

Autocommit is 1

===============================================================================

It's worth noting that you can perform transactions without disabling
autocommit just using standard sql. "START TRANSACTION;" will start a
transaction. "COMMIT;" will commit the results and "ROLLBACK;" will revert to
the pre-transaction state.

CREATE TABLE and CREATE DATABASE (and probably others) are always commited
immediately and your transaction appears to terminate. Thus any commands before
and after will be commited, even if a subsequent rollback is attempted.

If you are in the middle of a transaction and you call mysqli_close() it
appears that you get the funcitonality of an implicit rollback.

I can't reproduce the "code bug causes lock" problem outlined below (I always
get a successful rollback and the script will run umtine times successfully).
Therefore, I would suggest that the problem is fixed in php-5.2.2.
===============================================================================

Just to be clear, autocommit not only turns on/off transactions, but will also
'commit' any waiting queries.
<?php
mysqli_autocommit($link, FALSE); // turn OFF auto
-some query 1;
-some query 2;
mysqli_commit($link); // process ALL queries so far
-some query 3;
-some query 4;
mysqli_autocommit($link, TRUE); // turn ON auto
?>
All 4 will be processed.
===============================================================================

I've found that if PHP exits due to a code bug during a transaction, an InnoDB
table can remain locked until Apache is restarted.

The simple test is to start a transaction by setting $mysqli_obj->autocommit
(false) and executing an insert statement.  Before getting to a $mysqli_obj->
commit statement - have a runtime code bug bomb PHP.  You check the database,
no insert happened (you assume a rollback occurred) .. and you go fix the bug,
and try again... but this time the script takes about 50 seconds to timeout -
the insert statement returning with a “1205 - Lock wait timeout exceeded; try
restarting transaction”.  No rollback occurred. And this error will not go away
until you restart Apache - for whatever reason, the resources are not released
until the process is killed.

I found that an ‘exit’, instead of a PHP code bug, will not cause a problem. So
there is an auto-rollback mechanism in place - it just fails miserably when PHP
dies unexpectantly. Having to restarting apache is a pretty drastic measure to
overcome a code bug.

To avoid this problem, I use “register_shutdown_function()” when I start a
transaction, and set a flag to indicate a transaction is in process (because
there is no unregister_shutdown_function()). See below. So the __shutdown_check
() routine (I beleive it needs to be public) is called when the script bombs -
which is able to invoke the rollback().

these are just the relevant bits to give u an idea...

<?php

public function begin_transaction() {
  $ret = $this->mysqli_obj->autocommit(false);
  $this->transaction_in_progress = true;
  register_shutdown_function(array($this, "__shutdown_check"));
}

public function __shutdown_check() {
  if ($this->transaction_in_progress) {
    $this->rollback();
  }
}

public function commit() {
  $ret = $this->mysqli_obj->commit();
  $this->transaction_in_progress = false;
}

public function rollback() {
  $ret = $this->mysqli_obj->rollback();
  $this->transaction_in_progress = false;
}
?>

True for PHP 5.1.6 + MySQL 5.0.24a.
===============================================================================

If you are using the mysql command line tool, here are some helpful hints for
the autocommit feature:

1.  To view the current autocommit setting, you can use this query: select
@@autocommit;  It will return the current setting as 1 or 0 (on or off)

2. You can manage the default autocommit feature in you my.cnf or my.ini by
adding the following line: init_connect='set autocommit=0'.  I'm pretty sure
this isn't in the documentation, but it does work.

Here are the current engines, as of MySQL 5.1dev that support transactions:

InnoDB
BerkeleyDB
Falcon

Falcon is very new, so beware using it on production systems.

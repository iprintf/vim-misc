Please note there is a difference between ldaps and start-TLS for ldap. 
start-TLS uses port 389, while ldaps uses port 636.  ldaps has been deprecated
in favour of start-TLS for ldap.  Both encrypted (start-TLS ldap)  and
unencrypted ldap (ldap) run on port 389 concurrently.

Errors encountered are generally due to misunderstanding how to implement
TLS-encrypted ldap.

Tested in Linux, ubuntu 9.10, PHP/5.2.10-2 and Apache/2.2.1.2

INTEGRATING ACTIVE DIRECTORY WITH PHP-LDAP AND TLS IN LINUX
=============================================================

I'm not an expert, but it works.

1)I have installed ubuntu 9.10 desktop

2)Packages:
apt-get install apache2
apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
apt-get install libldap-2.4-2
apt-get install ldap-utils
apt-get install libsasl2-modules-ldap
apt-get install openssl
apt-get install libsasl2-2
apt-get install libkrb5-3
apt-get install php5-ldap
apt-get install php5-sasl
apt-get install php5-auth-pam

3)Put the PEM certificate.
cd /etc/ldap
mkdir certs
copy /myhome/mycert.pem /etc/ldap/certs/mycert.pem
NOTE:webcert.crt rename to mycert.pem. It's the same

4)Edit the file /etc/ldap/ldap.conf and Add:
  TLS_REQCERT never
  TLS_CACERT /etc/ldap/certs/mycert.pem

5)Create file /var/www/ldaptlstest.php:

<?php

   $ldap="ldap.myDomain.com";
   $usr="user@myDomain.com";
   $pwd="mypassword";
  
   $ds=ldap_connect($ldap); 
   $ldapbind=false;
   if(ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3))
      if(ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0))
         if(ldap_start_tls($ds))
               $ldapbind = @ldap_bind($ds, $usr, $pwd);   
   ldap_close($ds);

   if(!$ldapbind)
      echo "ERROR";
   else
      echo "OK";
?>

6)Restart the server: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

7)Open Firefox and write: http://localhost/ldaptlstest.php
;)

INTEGRATING ACTIVE DIRECTORY WITH PHP-LDAP AND TLS
==================================================

My configuration:
Apache/2.2.14 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8k PHP/5.2.11

NOTE 1: At the momment, the versión 5.3.1 fail with tls
NOTE 2: This example works on windows, but in linux is similar

1) Download the Certificate X.509 (PEM format) from a web browser, I used
Firefox. I put the name webcert.crt
2) Create the folder c:\openldap\sysconf
3) Copy the file webcert.crt to c:\openldap\sysconf
4) With notepad you must create the file c:\openldap\sysconf\ldap.conf file.
The file contents:
TLS_REQCERT never
TLS_CACERT c:\openldap\sysconf\webcert.crt
5) The code:

<?php
   $ldap="ldap.myDomain.com";
   $usr="user@myDomain.com";
   $pwd="mypassword";
  
   $ds=ldap_connect($ldap); 
   $ldapbind=false;
   if(ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3))
      if(ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0))
         if(ldap_start_tls($ds))
               $ldapbind = @ldap_bind($ds, $usr, $pwd);   
   ldap_close($ds);
   if(!$ldapbind)
       echo "ERROR";
   else
       echo "OK";
?>
===============================================================================

For all users,admins how are using or taying to connect to Microsoft Active
Directory with PHP openLDAP extension, Apache,OpenSSL and they are getting:
"Warning: ldap_bind(): Unable to bind to server: Can't contact LDAP server"
here is the solution as i did:
--------------------------------
upgrade to PHP 5.4.x
creat a directory as: C:\openldap\sysconf\ldap.conf

write into this file (ldap.conf):
TLS_CACERT path\to\your\CA\cert\file.crt

(like d:\monCA_Cert\ca.crt)

restart your apache web server, and refresh your page and tell me (allah yar7am
lwalidin)in arabic

for more here's my mail:med.ezzairi@gmail.com
===============================================================================

When you have this error:
Warning: ldap_start_tls() [function.ldap-start-tls]: Unable to start TLS:
Connect error in /var/www/X.php on line Y

It's probably because of a certificate validity issue. You can check the error
by adding debug level:
<?php
ldap_set_option(NULL, LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL, 7);
?>
This can be done before the ldap_connect takes place.

To fix the certificate validity issue:
add
TLS_REQCERT never
in file (create it if not exist)
c:\openldap\sysconf\ldap.conf    <= Windows
/etc/ldap.conf     <= linux
A restart of the web server may be required to apply changes
It's probably not the best solution but it works ...

Another thing to be aware of is that it requires version 3 (version 2 is php
default):
<?php
$con = ldap_connect($hostnameSSL);
ldap_set_option($con, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
?>

Another tip : the second parameter of ldap_connect is not used if you use an
URL like "ldap://..." (port 389 automatically used) or "ldaps://..."  (port 636
automatically used).
===============================================================================

PHP Warning:  ldap_start_tls(): Unable to start TLS: Operations error in /path/
to/script.php

Do not use ldap_start_tls() if you've already connected to the LDAP Server via
SSL e.g. "ldaps://hostame".
===============================================================================

Note that, on Windows, due to a bug in the php_ldap extension for php 5.3.2,
the location of the ldap.conf may change.

In this case, PHP expects the ldap.conf file to be in the root filesystem where
the Webserver Document root is installed (for instance C:\ldap.conf).

This seems to be fixed in PHP 5.3.3RC1

See the following bug reference:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48866
===============================================================================

ldaps:// (on port 636) is NOT the same as using STARTTLS on port 389.

The second method upgrades the security of a plain connection to an encrypted
channel, which is strongly recommended for plain binding (DN/password).
===============================================================================

If your version was linked against the OpenLDAP libraries, you may want to look
at the ldap.conf file for more information about specifying SSL/TLS behavior.
Apparently, the settings in ldap.conf make a different in the way SSL/TLS is
handled by PHP.
===============================================================================

Note that (in my very limited experience) you cannot use the ldaps protocol
with tls, or ldap_start_tls() will report "ldap_start_tls(): Unable to start
TLS: Operations error", and ldap_error() will return error code 1.

I found that I had to call ldap_connect() with ldap:// rather than ldaps:// for
ldap_start_tls() to succeed.  Hope this helps someone!
===============================================================================

It should be mentioned, that TLS connections for LDAP *REQUIRE* you to use LDAP
Protocol version 3.  By default, PHP uses Protocol 2. 
Therefore, if you do not know this, you may be puzzled as to why you get "TLS
not supported" error.

To get around this, just use ldap_set_option to make the LDAP connection use
Protocol 3 (if supported).

For example:

$ds = ldap_connect($LDAP_SERVER,$LDAP_PORT);
if ($ds) {
   if (!ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)) {
      fatal_error("Failed to set LDAP Protocol version to 3, TLS not
supported.");
    }
    if (!ldap_start_tls($ds)) {
       fatal_error("Ldap_start_tls failed");
    }
    // now we need to bind anonymously to the ldap server
    $bth = ldap_bind($ds);
    //make your query
}
===============================================================================

In my experience:

1)
PHP / openldap / whatever could NOT read .pem files.
They had to be .pfx or .cer
(I don't even know which one worked. I converted the .pem to both and called it
done.)

2)
In /etc/openldap/ldap.conf you must:
Either set TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/cacerts/YOURCERT.pfx
Or set TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/openldap/cacerts/
The first one constrains you to a specific cert.
The latter tries all of them in the directory.

3)
You have various options for TLS_REQCERT:
allow (use it if you need it)
require (must have a cert)
You'll have to read openldap docs for the rest.
I used allow, and it worked.
ymmv

4)
I did not change anything in the (very long) default /etc/ldap.conf file

5)
I did not change anything in the self-documenting /etc/autofs_ldap_auth.conf
Mainly because I just found it while typing this up, and I have no idea what it
does.  Presumably 'autofs' implies you can mount some LDAP server as a mount
point or something at boot... Sounds funky to me, but knock yourself out
playing with it.

This was all with various versions of PHP ranging from 5.2 to 5.3  No promises
about other versions.

6)
ldapsearch -VV says it's 2.3.43
Dunno if that comes with openldap or I downloaded it separately. Long time
ago.  Very handy CLI tool for mucking around without PHP in the middle, so you
can cross-check that it's PHP or not.
===============================================================================

More on TLS start.

It seems that either you ldap_connect to ldaps://, port 636 or you
ldap_tls_start.

In my case, using ldaps on port 636 (to be sure I enforce TLS) the connection
will go like:

$LDAP_SERVER="ldaps://ldap.../";
$LDAP_PORT=636;

$ds = ldap_connect($LDAP_SERVER,$LDAP_PORT);
if ($ds) {
   if (!ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)) {
     fatal_error("Failed to set LDAP Protocol version to 3, TLS not
supported.");
   }
/*** NO NEED ***
*   if (!ldap_start_tls($ds)) {
*      exit;
*   }
***/
   // now we need to bind anonymously to the ldap server
   $bth = ldap_bind($ds);
   //make your query
===============================================================================

Note : if you are using OpenLdap client > v2 and PHP > 4.0.4, you don't have to
use that function. You just have to specify it using
<?php
ldap_connect("ldaps://yourhostname", 636);
?>

If you use both ldaps:// uri and ldap_start_tls function, you'll get a warning
saying that a TLS/SSL session is already open.
===============================================================================

I seemingly take forever to make use of ldap_start_tls work.
Especially lacking in document, I was frustrate and almost gave up until I saw
this link in the php forum.
I thought it is worth for put the link in here.

http://marc.info/?l=php-windows&m=116127873321748&w=2

it is really work, and it saves me.

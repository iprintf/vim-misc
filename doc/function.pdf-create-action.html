Here is a  note i feel important for newbies

$url = PDF_create_action($p, "URI", "url=http://www.pdflib.com");

PDF_create_annotation ($p, 44, 100, 55,700, "Link", "linewidth=0 action
{activate $url}");

Above  2 lines will change the hand
cursor once your cursor is in the rectangle as assigned by the
create_annotation command.  Once you click in that area, it will
bring you to the url in create_action command.
===============================================================================

The equal sign is interpreted as a separator sign in the optlist. But there's a
way to have an url with GET params.
With the example given below:

$url = PDF_create_action($p, "URI", "url {http://www.pdflib.com/?page=home}");

PDF_create_annotation ($p, 44, 100, 55,700, "Link", "linewidth=0 action
{activate $url}");
===============================================================================

I just want to point out that PDF_create_action does not work for URLs with GET
parameters (has problems with '='). Running urlencode will just create a URL
that is not translated properly by the browser (at least for Firefox 2.0.0.11).

Believe it or not, your best bet is to use pdf_add_weblink(), which is
supposedly deprecated.

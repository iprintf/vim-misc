QuickHashIntHash::loadFromString — This factory method creates a hash from a
string

说明

public static QuickHashIntHash QuickHashIntHash::loadFromString ( string
$contents [, int $options ] )

This factory method creates a new hash from a definition in a string. The file
format consists of 32 bit signed integers packed together in the Endianness
that the system that the code runs on uses. For each element there are two 32
bit signed integers stored. The first of each element is the key, and the
second is the value belonging to the key.

参数

contents

    The string containing a serialized format of the hash.

options

    The same options that the class' constructor takes; except that the size
    option is ignored. It is automatically calculated to be the same as the
    number of entries in the hash, rounded up to the nearest power of two with
    a maximum limit of 4194304.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntHash.

范例

Example #1 QuickHashIntHash::loadFromString() example

<?php
$contents = file_get_contents( dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.hash" );
$hash = QuickHashIntHash::loadFromString(
    $contents,
    QuickHashIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC
);
foreach( range( 0, 0x0f ) as $key )
{
    printf( "Key %3d (%2x) is %s\n",
        $key, $key, 
        $hash->exists( $key ) ? 'set' : 'unset'
    );
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Key   0 ( 0) is unset
Key   1 ( 1) is set
Key   2 ( 2) is set
Key   3 ( 3) is set
Key   4 ( 4) is unset
Key   5 ( 5) is set
Key   6 ( 6) is unset
Key   7 ( 7) is set
Key   8 ( 8) is unset
Key   9 ( 9) is unset
Key  10 ( a) is unset
Key  11 ( b) is set
Key  12 ( c) is unset
Key  13 ( d) is set
Key  14 ( e) is unset
Key  15 ( f) is unset

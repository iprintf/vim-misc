fbsql_fetch_object — Fetch a result row as an object

说明

object fbsql_fetch_object ( resource $result )

fbsql_fetch_object() is similar to fbsql_fetch_array(), with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can
only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are
illegal property names).

Speed-wise, the function is identical to fbsql_fetch_array(), and almost as
quick as fbsql_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).

参数

result

    由 fbsql_query() 或 fbsql_db_query() 返回的结果标识符。

返回值

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

范例

Example #1 fbsql_fetch_object() example

<?php
fbsql_connect($host, $user, $password);
$result = fbsql_db_query("database", "select * from table");
while ($row = fbsql_fetch_object($result)) {
    echo $row->user_id;
    echo $row->fullname;
}
fbsql_free_result($result);
?>

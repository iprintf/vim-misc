===============================================================================

The DOMXPath object doesn't create a reference to the document. If you load a
new xml using either load, loadXML or loadHTML functions the DOMXPath object
will still query and evaluate over the source in the DOMDocument when it was
created.
===============================================================================

As of PHP 5.2.0, DOMXPath object implements XPath 1.0.

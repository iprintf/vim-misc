ZipArchive::addFile

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PHP 7, PECL zip >= 1.1.0)

ZipArchive::addFile — Adds a file to a ZIP archive from the given path

说明

bool ZipArchive::addFile ( string $filename [, string $localname = NULL [, int
$start = 0 [, int $length = 0 ]]] )

Adds a file to a ZIP archive from a given path.

参数

filename

    The path to the file to add.

localname

    If supplied, this is the local name inside the ZIP archive that will
    override the filename.

start

    This parameter is not used but is required to extend ZipArchive.

length

    This parameter is not used but is required to extend ZipArchive.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

This example opens a ZIP file archive test.zip and add the file /path/to/
index.txt. as newname.txt.

Example #1 Open and add

<?php
$zip = new ZipArchive;
if ($zip->open('test.zip') === TRUE) {
    $zip->addFile('/path/to/index.txt', 'newname.txt');
    $zip->close();
    echo 'ok';
} else {
    echo 'failed';
}
?>

注释

    Note:

    When a file is set to be added to the archive, PHP will lock the file. The
    lock is only released once the ZipArchive object has been closed, either
    via ZipArchive::close() or the ZipArchive object being destroyed. This may
    prevent you from being able to delete the file being added until after the
    lock has been released.

===============================================================================

It is not obvious, since there are no noticeable examples around, but you can
use $localname (second parameter) to define and control file/directory
structure inside the zip. Use it if you do not want files to be included with
their absolute directory tree.

<?php

$zip->addFile($abs_path, $relative_path);

?>
===============================================================================

When adding a file to your zip, the file is opened and stays open.
When adding over 1024 files (depending on your open files limit) the server
stops adding files, resulting in a status 11 in your zip Archive. There is no
warning when exceeding this open files limit with addFiles.

Check your open files with ulimit -a

This kept me busy for some time.
===============================================================================

Beware: calling $zip->addFile() on a file that doesn't exist will succeed and
return TRUE, delaying the failure until you make the final $zip->close() call,
which will return FALSE and potentially leave you scratching your head.

If you're adding multiple files to a zip and your $zip->close() call is
returning FALSE, ensure that all the files you added actually exist.

It's also a good idea to check each file with file_exists() or is_readable()
before calling $zip->addFile() on it.
===============================================================================

If you have problem with windows explorer reading zipfile created by linux,
try:
$oZip->addFile ( $file_name, " " . basename ( $file_name ) )
That space " " should solve.
===============================================================================

I had a huge number of files and folders that I needed to zip on a linux web
server. I was running into timeout problems and file enumerator issues, as well
as file handler limit issues (ulimit). I used a script to solve u limit offered
by Farzad Ghanei first (ZipArchiveImproved), but closing and reopening his way
didn't do the trick for me.

I eventually did a simple call to a $filelimit variable I created that records
file handler limit I want my script to hit before it closes and reopens the
file.
<?php
$filelimit = 255;

if ($zip->numFiles == $filelimit) {$zip->close(); $zip->open($file) or die (
"Error: Could not reopen Zip");}
?>

This made some progress for me, timeouts were gone, but when calling
<?php $zip->addFile($filepath, $archivefilepath); ?>
after the reopening of the Zip, I got an error. I echoed the <?php $zip->
numFiles; ?> and found that after reopening, the numFile enum reset to '0'.

A few more goose-chases later, I tried addFromString with some better results,
but did not get it working 100% until I actually coupled addFromString with
addFile! My working scripting for the add files function on massive file-folder
structures looks like so:

<?php
$sourcefolder = /rel/path/to/source/folder/on/server/

$dirlist = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($sourcefolder);

$filelist = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($dirlist);

//how many file can be added before a reopen is forced?
$filelimit = 245;

// Defines the action
$file = tempnam("tmp", "zip");
$zip = new ZipArchive();

// This creates and then gives the option to save the zip file

if ($zip->open($file, ZipArchive::OVERWRITE) !== TRUE) {

    die ("Could not open archive");

}

// adds files to the file list
foreach ($filelist as $key=>$value) {

    //fix archive paths
    $path = str_replace($sourcefolder, "", $key); //remove the source path from
the $key to return only the file-folder structure from the root of the source
folder
    if (!file_exists($key)) { die($key.' does not exist. Please contact your
administrator or try again later.'); }
      if (!is_readable($key)) { die($key.' not readable. Please contact your
administrator or try again later.'); }    
          if ($zip->numFiles == $filelimit) {$zip->close(); $zip->open($file)
or die ("Error: Could not reopen Zip");}

    $zip->addFromString($path, $key) or die ("ERROR: Could not add file: $key
</br> numFile:".$zip->numFiles);
    $zip->addFile(realpath($key), $path) or die ("ERROR: Could not add file: 
$key </br> numFile:".$zip->numFiles);
   
}

// closes the archive
$zip->close();

//make local temp file a .zip, rename, and move to output dir
rename ($file, "./" . $outputfolder . "/" . $zipfilename);
?>
I hope this may help someone else.
===============================================================================

The workaround above (file_get_contents) is very dangerous if you pack large
files. (see memory limit).
Close/open the zip archive periodically instead of using file_get_contents().
===============================================================================

What is worse is that when you run out of filedescriptors it seems to fail
silently, I have not been able to find any errors in any logfiles.
===============================================================================

On my system (Windows), I found that ZipArchive uses IBM850 encoding for
filenames (localname). For filenames with special characters such as (é) &
eacute; which appears at 0xE9 in the ISO-8859-1, it is at 0x82 in IBM850. I had
to call iconv('ISO-8859-1', 'IBM850', 'Québec') to get correct file names.
===============================================================================

If you add files that have an absolut path, like for example:
/mnt/repository/my_file.pdf
the standard windows zip utility will not be able to extract the files. The
first slash trips the zip utility. You have to add relative file paths or use a
symbolic link.
===============================================================================

Here's a little extension to ZipArchive that handles directories recursively:

<?php

class Zipper extends ZipArchive {
   
public function addDir($path) {
    print 'adding ' . $path . '<br>';
    $this->addEmptyDir($path);
    $nodes = glob($path . '/*');
    foreach ($nodes as $node) {
        print $node . '<br>';
        if (is_dir($node)) {
            $this->addDir($node);
        } else if (is_file($node))  {
            $this->addFile($node);
        }
    }
}
   
} // class Zipper

?>
===============================================================================

Another surprise, which took a lot of trouble. So that after you add a file to
the archive it can be safely removed, took advantage of such construction:

if (!is_file ($archive)) :
    $result = $zip->open ($archive, ZipArchive::CREATE);
else :
    $result = $zip->open ($archive);
endif;
if ($result === TRUE) :
    if (($zip->addFile ($file, $filename)) === TRUE) :
        $theoreticaly_added = TRUE;
    endif;
    if ((($zip->close ()) === TRUE) && $theoreticaly_added) :
        unlink ($file);
    endif;
endif;

Now the files will not disappear. But perhaps there is a simpler solution,
which gives 100% guarantee?
===============================================================================

In some versions of this library you NEED to add the "localfile" parameter or
the file will not show in the Zip folder.
===============================================================================

Do NOT use ZipArchive::addFile() to append a folder.

When a folder's path is passed to ZipArchive::addFile(), the method returns
true, but ZipArchive can neither create a zip archive nor can it make any
change to a existing file.

<?php
    $z = new ZipArchive();
    if(true === ($z->open('./foo.zip', ZipArchive::CREATE | ZipArchive::
OVERWRITE))){
        $z->setArchiveComment('Interesting!');
        $z->addFromString('domain.txt', 'wuxiancheng.cn');
        $folder = './test';
        !is_dir($folder) && mkdir($folder); // Create an folder for testing
        if(true === $z->addFile($folder)){
            echo 'success'; // !!!
        }
        rmdir($folder);
        $z->close();
        // foo.zip will NOT be saved on disk.
        // If foo.zip already exists before we run this script, the file will
remain unchanged.
    }
?>
===============================================================================

Note that using addFile() will change the order of the files within the zip, in
fact within the index of the zip. Does not matter much, except if you loop the
index and use addFile() within that loop : it will likely give messy results.

Example :
<?php
$zip = new ZipArchive;
if ($zip->open('somefile.zip') === TRUE) {
  for ($i = 0; $i < $zip->numFiles; $i++) {
    if (forsomereason()) {
      addFile('./somenewfile.ext', $zip->getNameIndex($i));
    }
  }
}
$zip->close();
?>

This code may loop for ever, depending on your forsomereason() function, or at
least you're at risk.

Try something like this instead :

<?php
$zip = new ZipArchive;
if ($zip->open('somefile.zip') === TRUE) {
  for ($i = 0; $i < $zip->numFiles; $i++) {
    if (forsomereason()) {
      $couples[]=array('filename'=>'./somenewfile.ext','localname'=>$zip->
getNameIndex($i));
    }
  }
}
foreach ($couples as $couple) $zip->addFile($couple['filename'],$couple[
'localname']);
$zip->close();
?>

Hope it helps ;-)
===============================================================================

The manual is lying.

"In short, it means you can first delete an added file after the archive is
closed. "

Thats true but not by locking the file...
Warning! This method works asynchronous!

It seems that addFile() will return TRUE if the file stat command returns
correctly, but the operation itself will not happen yet.

Instead, deleting a file is always possible. I have discovered this behaviour
by using a temporary file and deleting it immediately after addFile() returns.
The result was that no archive was created nor any file was added although
every operation (creating,open(),addFile()) returned true before. The operation
silenty fails.
===============================================================================

Note that there is no concept of "folders" for ZIP files. If you need to store
data into folders, use forward slashes ("/") in $localname to separate folder
(s) and the file name.

Example:
$zip->addFile("test.txt", "mainfolder/subfolder/test.txt");
===============================================================================

It should be noted that the example provided above is not accurate.

Unlike extractTo, zip_open does not return a boolean result, so the above
example will always fail.
===============================================================================

2 tips:

- The example in on this page is a bit misleading for new programmers. It works
only if the ZIP archive file exists already. Don't forget to use
ZipArchive::CREATE and optionally ZipArchive::OVERWRITE in the second optional
parameter in the open() function.

- If you want to add files and directories recursively (see some examples from
other comments here on this page) use scandir() instead of blob() because blob
() does not list hidden files like ".htaccess" for example.
===============================================================================

The addFile() method does not accept the "file://" protocol. Strip away "file:/
/" and use the absolute path instead.

I assume that it also does not accept any other protocols, I was having issues
trying to add files, other functions within the application I was building
required the use of the protocol.

Also to note, the status code returned did not match any of the predefined
error codes, and the status code was never the same. My assumption was a
overflow on the variable as the status codes were around the minimum and
maximum INT values.
===============================================================================

Currently the number of files that can be added using addFile to the ZIP
archive (until it is closed) is limited by file descriptors limit. This is an
easy workaround (on the bug links below you can find another workarounds):
<?php
    /** work around file descriptor number limitation (to avoid failure
     * upon adding more than typically 253 or 1024 files to ZIP) */
    function addFileToZip( $zip, $path, $zipEntryName ) {
        // this would fail with status ZIPARCHIVE::ER_OPEN
        // after certain number of files is added since
        // ZipArchive internally stores the file descriptors of all the
        // added files and only on close writes the contents to the ZIP file
        // see: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40494
        // and: http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=9443
        // return $zip->addFile( $path, $zipEntryName );

        $contents = file_get_contents( $path );
        if ( $contents === false ) {
            return false;
        }
        return $zip->addFromString( $zipEntryName, $contents );
    }
?>
===============================================================================

Note that ZipArchive::open() not return boolean value, but integer, for example
:
$zip = new ZipArchive();
$filename = '/tmp/test.zip';
var_dum($zip->open($filename)); // return's : int (11)
===============================================================================

If you have some warnings with ZipArchiveImproved since the last Ubuntu update,
replace "self::CREATE" by "self::CREATE | self::OVERWRITE" in the reopen
function

===============================================================================

This add directory function does not require that you create a new wrapper
class, and also does not add the entire file directory tree into your zip file.

<?php

public function addDirectoryToZip($zip, $dir, $base)
{
    $newFolder = str_replace($base, '', $dir);
    $zip->addEmptyDir($newFolder);
    foreach(glob($dir . '/*') as $file)
    {
        if(is_dir($file))
        {
            $zip = $this->addDirectoryToZip($zip, $file, $base);
        }
        else
        {
            $newFile = str_replace($base, '', $file);
            $zip->addFile($file, $newFile);
        }
    }
    return $zip;
}

?>
===============================================================================

Note that the file isn't actually added to the archive until the $zip->close()
method is called. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why no time() went
by after adding large files via $zip->addFile() but would then time out the
script.
===============================================================================

here is a basic class that extends the ZipArchive to:
  * add a functionality to report the ZIP file address (I needed it and I could
not find out how in ZipArchive documentation).
  * resolve the problem of adding so many files to the archive due file
descriptor limit. the ZipArchiveImproved::addFile() handles this.

This is my workaround for the file descriptor limit by closing/opening the
archive file periodically.

<?php
if($backup = new ZipArchive()) {
    if($backup->open($zip, ZIPARCHIVE::OVERWRITE) === true) {
        $backup->addFile($file['realpath'], $file['path']);
        if(($count++) == 200) { // the file descriptor limit
            $backup->close();
            if($backup = new ZipArchive()) {

            }
        }
    }
    $backup->close();

?>

Hope it helps someone.
===============================================================================

thought it might come in handy
recursively adds all directories and files within a directory

class zip extends ZipArchive {
   
    public function addDirectory($dir) { // adds directory
        foreach(glob($dir . '/*') as $file) {
            if(is_dir($file))
                $this->addDirectory($file);
            else
                $this->addFile($file);
        }
    }
}
===============================================================================

<?php
$zip=new ZipArchive;
$zip->addFile('path to the file', 'new name of the file');
?>

What I have to do, when I wan't to have the file in the zip archive with it's
name before archiving?
(Sorry, I'm from Czech Republic and I can't speak English very well, if I did
anywhere mistake, so ignore that pease :-)
===============================================================================

I have had several problems trying adding files, because of a path problem. The
error gived was this:

ZipArchive::addFile() [function.ZipArchive-addFile]: Unable to access <path>

I used an absolute root starting by "/", and it didn't work. Try starting your
path with "./" (referencing the root of your site).

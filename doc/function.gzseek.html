(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

gzseek — Seek on a gz-file pointer

说明

int gzseek ( resource $zp , int $offset [, int $whence = SEEK_SET ] )

Sets the file position indicator for the given file pointer to the given offset
byte into the file stream. Equivalent to calling (in C) gzseek(zp, offset,
SEEK_SET).

If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
supported; gzseek() then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new starting
position.

参数

zp

    The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
    successfully opened by gzopen().

offset

    The seeked offset.

whence

    whence values are:
      □ SEEK_SET - Set position equal to offset bytes.
      □ SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus offset.

    If whence is not specified, it is assumed to be SEEK_SET.

返回值

Upon success, returns 0; otherwise, returns -1. Note that seeking past EOF is
not considered an error.

范例

Example #1 gzseek() example

<?php
$gz = gzopen('somefile.gz', 'r');
gzseek($gz,2);
echo gzgetc($gz);
gzclose($gz);
?>

===============================================================================

Since seek after the end is not considered an error, I doubt that "while
(gzseek ($fh, $eof) == 0) $eof += $d;" will get into infinite loop.

PHP/4.3.9
contrary to the notes, gzseek() returns -1 if I try to seek past the end of the
file.  here is a function that will return the last seekable position, and put
the file pointer there.

/** sets the file pointer at the end of the file
*  and returns the number of bytes in the file.
*/
function gzend($fh)
{
   $d   = 1<<14;
   $eof = $d;
   while ( gzseek($fh, $eof) == 0 ) $eof += $d;
   while ( $d > 1 )
   {
      $d >>= 1;
      $eof += $d * (gzseek($fh, $eof)? -1 : 1);
   }
   return $eof;
}

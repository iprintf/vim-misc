MongoCommandCursor::batchSize

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoCommandCursor::batchSize — Limits the number of elements returned in one
batch.

Description

public MongoCommandCursor MongoCommandCursor::batchSize ( int $batchSize )

A cursor typically fetches a batch of result objects and store them locally.
This method sets the batchSize value to configure the amount of documents
retrieved from the server in one round trip.

Parameters

batchSize

    The number of results to return per batch. Each batch requires a round-trip
    to the server.

    This cannot override MongoDB's limit on the amount of data it will return
    to the client (i.e., if you set batch size to 1,000,000,000, MongoDB will
    still only return 4-16MB of results per batch).

Return Values

Returns this cursor.

Examples

Example #1 MongoCommandCursor::batchSize()

<?php
$commandCursor->batchSize(20);
?>

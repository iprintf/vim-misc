xdiff_file_bdiff — Make binary diff of two files

说明

bool xdiff_file_bdiff ( string $old_file , string $new_file , string $dest )

Makes a binary diff of two files and stores the result in a patch file. This
function works with both text and binary files. Resulting patch file can be
later applied using xdiff_file_bpatch()/xdiff_string_bpatch().

参数

old_file

    Path to the first file. This file acts as "old" file.

new_file

    Path to the second file. This file acts as "new" file.

dest

    Path of the resulting patch file. Resulting file contains differences
    between "old" and "new" files. It is in binary format and is
    human-unreadable.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 xdiff_file_bdiff() example

The following code makes binary diff of two archives.

<?php
$old_version = 'my_script_1.0.tgz';
$new_version = 'my_script_1.1.tgz';

xdiff_file_bdiff($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.bdiff');
?>

注释

    Note:

    Both files will be loaded into memory so ensure that your memory_limit is
    set high enough.

gettext

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

gettext — Lookup a message in the current domain

说明

string gettext ( string $message )

Looks up a message in the current domain.

参数

message

    The message being translated.

返回值

Returns a translated string if one is found in the translation table, or the
submitted message if not found.

范例

Example #1 gettext()-check

<?php
// Set language to German
putenv('LC_ALL=de_DE');
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE');

// Specify location of translation tables
bindtextdomain("myPHPApp", "./locale");

// Choose domain
textdomain("myPHPApp");

// Translation is looking for in ./locale/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/myPHPApp.mo now

// Print a test message
echo gettext("Welcome to My PHP Application");

// Or use the alias _() for gettext()
echo _("Have a nice day");
?>

注释

    Note:

    You may use the underscore character '_' as an alias to this function.

    Note:

    Setting a language isn't enough for some systems and the putenv() should be
    used to define the current locale.

As of php 5.3, you can use the following code to get the preferred locale of
the http agent.

<?php
$locale = Locale::acceptFromHttp($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']);
?>

I just wanted to say that gettext won't work on WAMP Server 2.4 / 64 Bit, see
the thread I posted here:

Title: Gettext doesn't work on WAMP 64 Bits
http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,120770,120770#msg-120770

I haven't tested with only apache 64 Bit, so, I don't know if the issue is
related to apache or WAMP. Anyway, to make it work with WAMP, install the 32
Bit version of WAMP and only do this:

define('LOCALE_DIR', '<root_dir_of_your_po_files>'); //ie: C:/wamp/www/your_app
/locale
$locale = '<your_locale>'; //ie: es_CO
$domain = 'your_gettext_domain'; //ie: messages
putenv('LC_ALL=' . $locale);
bindtextdomain($domain, LOCALE_DIR);
textdomain($domain);
echo _('<your_string>'; // ie: Hello world

"setlocale" nor setting the LANG, LANGUAGE, and LC_MESSAGES environment
variables seems to be necessary under windows. I got it working by setting
"LC_ALL" only.
===============================================================================

Gettext translations are cached. If you change *.mo files your page may not be
translated as expected. Here's simple workaround which does not require
restarting webserver (I know, this is just a dirty hack):

<?php
function initialize_i18n($locale) {
    putenv('LANG='.$locale);
    setlocale(LC_ALL,"");
    setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,$locale);
    setlocale(LC_CTYPE,$locale);
    $domains = glob($locales_root.'/'.$locale.'/LC_MESSAGES/messages-*.mo');
    $current = basename($domains[0],'.mo');
    $timestamp = preg_replace('{messages-}i','',$current);
    bindtextdomain($current,$locales_root);
    textdomain($current);
    }
?>

to make this work you have to put your locale inside file messages-
[unix_time].mo and use this name (without .mo) as your domain to fool caching
mechanism (domain names differ)

msgfmt messages.po -o messages-`date +%s`.mo

for me this works fine (although this is not very elegant solution)
===============================================================================

The simplest way to by-pass gettext() cache, without restart apache nor change
domain.

The fix is incredible simple, first create a dummy link to the locale folder
where .mo files stored:

cd locale
ln -s . nocache

Then add one single line before bindtextdomain()

<?php
bindtextdomain('domain', './locale/nocache');
bindtextdomain('domain', './locale');
?>

Now the cache is forced to flush every time.
===============================================================================

Worth noting is that gettext honors environment variables while selecting the
language to use: http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/
Locale-Environment-Variables.html

"When a program looks up locale dependent values, it does this according to the
following environment variables, in priority order:

    LANGUAGE
    LC_ALL
    LC_xxx, according to selected locale category: LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC,
LC_TIME, LC_COLLATE, LC_MONETARY, LC_MESSAGES, ...
    LANG

Variables whose value is set but is empty are ignored in this lookup. "

In short, if you have non-empty LANGUAGE, you may end up with unexpected
localization strings. On the other hand, LANGUAGE can be used to define
fallback language if some translation is missing.
===============================================================================

on OSX (10.9.3) and PHP (5.4.24) you need to use full local name including
codeset

i.e. for German need to use de_DE.UTF-8 even setlocale returns success when
used without .UTF-8 the lookups will not work.
===============================================================================

For me it is sufficient to call setlocale() with a string like "nl_BE" as the
second parameter, to make gettext() work. Just plain "nl" was not enough.

Ditto when using an environment variable like LANG: "en", "fr", "nl", "de" are
not enough: I have to specify the country, too.
===============================================================================

Take care when extracting the strings from the source files : if your source
files are not encoded in ascii, then xgettext must be used with the --from-code
option, and the generated .po file is *always* UTF-8 (even if you used a
different --from-code charset).

The usage of gettext will not work later on strings which include non ascii
caracters. For make it working, you have to translate the .po file to your
proper charset with msgconv.

Example :
my source files are encoded in iso-8859-1
$ xgettext --from-code=iso-8859-1 -n *.php -o myapp.po
==> myapp.po is in UTF-8 (and generated .mo files will not work with gettext).
I have to convert it to iso-8859-1 before translating :
$ msgconv --to-code=iso-8859-1 myapp.po -o myapp.po
...and now translate the file.
===============================================================================

Depending on the implementation of gettext used you might have to call the
setlocale(LC_ALL, "") command. 
So your example code would be

<?php

// Set language to German
putenv ("LANG=de");

// set the locale into the instance of gettext
setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

// Specify location of translation tables
bindtextdomain ("myPHPApp", "./locale");

// Choose domain
textdomain ("myPHPApp");

// Print a test message
print (gettext ("Welcome to My PHP Application"));
?>

NOTE:  If setlocale returns NULL the LANG specified is invalid and "not
supported".
===============================================================================

If you 're experiencing problems like gettext() is not working and you're
getting translated text only occassionaly use: unset LANG before starting
apache.
Next thing is that you have to restart apache after you 've changed .mo files
because they're treated something like shared libraries.
I've only tested this with Linux (Sourcemage Linux distro, Mandrake) but it
might be true for others as well.
===============================================================================

There's a good tutorial to the GetText tools used with PHP at http://zez.org/
article/articleview/42
The only modification I needed to do was to use the correct ISO-language/
country-codes (don't know the ISO number) and call setlocale.
helloworld.php:

<?php
putenv("LC_ALL=da_DK"); // For danish/Denmark
setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

// ./locale/da/LC_MESSAGES holds the helloworld.mo file
bindtextdomain("helloworld", "./locale");
textdomain("helloworld");

print(gettext("Hello world!"));
?>

I had a lot of trouble getting this to work on Red Hat (Yellow Dog) Linux
though.
===============================================================================

gettext returns the headers from .mo files
if the message parameter is set to empty.

So if you are for example using Smarty blocks, make sure that the values given
checks if the text has content or else your text will have a bunch of headers
printing.

If you are putting a variable to the gettext, like so:
_($text);
you are better of making another function like this:
<?php
function __($text){
if(empty($text)) return "";
else gettext($text);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Default behavior is name .mo file equally in every language version:
===
locale_dir

--- en_US
------ LC_MESSAGES
--------- lang.mo

--- sk_SK
------ LC_MESSAGES
--------- lang.mo
===

I think, better form is:
===
locale_dir

--- en_US
------ LC_MESSAGES
--------- en.mo

--- sk_SK
------ LC_MESSAGES
--------- sk.mo
===

Then the following code works very well (surprisingly on win32 too), and you
don't need restart apache and do other confusing things:

<?php
$gettext_domain = 'sk'; // change by language
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'sk_SK.UTF-8'); // change by language, directory name sk_SK,
not sk_SK.UTF-8
bindtextdomain($gettext_domain, "lang");
textdomain($gettext_domain);
bind_textdomain_codeset($gettext_domain, 'UTF-8');
?>

Have nice day :-)
===============================================================================

This function is not able to handle null values. It can return the complete
translation file if you enter null as argument.
===============================================================================

I had a problem like "adino at adino dot sk" said, so I did the unsetting of
LANG ($ unset LANG), but it was not sufficient, I had to unset the environment
variable LANGUAGE too.

I tried to do this using "sudo", but it didn't works, so I had to change to
root using "su"

If you need to know, I use Musix (a sub-distro of Devia).

I hope this will help you, Seeya! ^__^'
===============================================================================

If like me, you are stuck with making a lot of code localizable, you have to go
through all your php files and wrap all srings in _("string"). Here's an elisp
function which can help you out.

This function enables you to highlight some text in an emacs buffer and make it
a localizable string using the keyboard shortcut C-l (Ctrl and l). If the first
character highlighted is " or ', then it assumes the text is in php-context and
changes it to: _(HIGHLIGHTED_TEXT). Otherwise it assumes the text is in
html-context and changes it to <?=_('HIGHLIGHTED_TEXT')?>

The shortcut C-k can be used for translating parts of php strings which contain
html tabs. We dont want to translate the entire string including the tabs, so
we highlight just the substring that needs to be translated and use C-k.

To use it, do either of:
Copy and paste the following code into your .emacs file. This would permanently
associate the keyboard shortcut C-l with this function.
Save the code in a new file ending with the .el extension. Evaluate it using
M-x eval-buffer. This makes the C-l keyboard shortcut only last for the current
Emacs session.

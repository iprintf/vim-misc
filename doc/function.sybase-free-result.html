(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sybase_free_result — Frees result memory

说明

bool sybase_free_result ( resource $result )

sybase_free_result() only needs to be called if you are worried about using too
much memory while your script is running. All result memory will automatically
be freed when the script ends. You may call sybase_free_result() with the
result identifier as an argument and the associated result memory will be
freed.

参数

result

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

When processing queries that return MANY rows, and when you put a limit on the
number of rows you fetch from the result set, you should always call this
function to close the current result set, because the SQL server may still be
pending waiting for other rows to be fetched by your script. When you call this
function, the Sybase client in PHP3 will signal to Sybase SQL Server that other
pending results can be ignored, and the SQL server connection will return
faster to the "waiting command" state, instead of keeping in the "suspend"
state, saving much resources on the SQL-Server. In fact, it is  a good idea to
call this function after all your queries to save up SQL server resources.
Note that when processing SQL batchs with multiple queries, and stored
procedure calls that return multiple result sets, there's no provision here to
let the server return the next result set. There should be another function
like sybase_next_result() to close the current result set, and let the SQL
server go on the next SQL statements. Such a function would return a status
that indicates if further results are coming or if the query is really
terminated.

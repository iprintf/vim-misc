will have. Options are also supported.

参数

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be

    limited from 64 to 4194304.

options

    The options that you can pass in are:
    QuickHashStringIntHash::CHECK_FOR_DUPES, which makes sure no duplicate
    entries are added to the hash and
    QuickHashStringIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC to not use PHP's internal
    memory manager.

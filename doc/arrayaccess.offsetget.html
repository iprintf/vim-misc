ArrayAccess::offsetGet

(PHP 5 >= 5.0.0, PHP 7)

ArrayAccess::offsetGet — 获取一个偏移位置的值

说明

abstract public mixed ArrayAccess::offsetGet ( mixed $offset )

返回指定偏移位置的值。

当检查一个偏移位置是否为 empty() 时，此方法被执行。

参数

offset

    需要获取的偏移位置。

注释

    Note:

    Starting with PHP 5.3.4, the prototype checks were relaxed and it's
    possible for implementations of this method to return by reference. This
    makes indirect modifications to the overloaded array dimensions of
    ArrayAccess objects possible.

    A direct modification is one that replaces completely the value of the
    array dimension, as in $obj[6] = 7. An indirect modification, on the other
    hand, only changes part of the dimension, or attempts to assign the
    dimension by reference to another variable, as in $obj[6][7] = 7 or $var =&
    $obj[6]. Increments with ++ and decrements with -- are also implemented in
    a way that requires indirect modification.

    While direct modification triggers a call to ArrayAccess::offsetSet(),
    indirect modification triggers a call to ArrayAccess::offsetGet(). In that
    case, the implementation of ArrayAccess::offsetGet() must be able to return
    by reference, otherwise an E_NOTICE message is raised.

返回值

可返回任何类型。

(PECL fann >= 1.0.0)

fann_create_standard_array — Creates a standard fully connected backpropagation
neural network using an array of layer sizes

说明

resource fann_create_standard_array ( int $num_layers , array $layers )

Creates a standard fully connected backpropagation neural network.

There will be a bias neuron in each layer (except the output layer), and this
bias neuron will be connected to all neurons in the next layer. When running
the network, the bias nodes always emits 1.

To destroy a neural network use the fann_destroy() function.

参数

num_layers

    The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

layers

    An array of layer sizes.

返回值

Returns a neural network resource on success, or FALSE on error.

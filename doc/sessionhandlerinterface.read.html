SessionHandlerInterface::read

(PHP 5 >= 5.4.0, PHP 7)

SessionHandlerInterface::read — Read session data

说明

abstract public string SessionHandlerInterface::read ( string $session_id )

Reads the session data from the session storage, and returns the results.
Called right after the session starts or when session_start() is called. Please
note that before this method is called SessionHandlerInterface::open() is
invoked.

This method is called by PHP itself when the session is started. This method
should retrieve the session data from storage by the session ID provided. The
string returned by this method must be in the same serialized format as when
originally passed to the SessionHandlerInterface::write() If the record was not
found, return an empty string.

The data returned by this method will be decoded internally by PHP using the
unserialization method specified in session.serialize_handler. The resulting
data will be used to populate the $_SESSION superglobal.

Note that the serialization scheme is not the same as unserialize() and can be
accessed by session_decode().

参数

session_id

    The session id.

返回值

Returns an encoded string of the read data. If nothing was read, it must return
an empty string. Note this value is returned internally to PHP for processing.

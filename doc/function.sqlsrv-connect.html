sqlsrv_connect — Opens a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database

说明

resource sqlsrv_connect ( string $serverName [, array $connectionInfo ] )

Opens a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database. By default, the
connection is attempted using Windows Authentication. To connect using SQL
Server Authentication, include "UID" and "PWD" in the connection options array.

参数

serverName

    The name of the server to which a connection is established. To connect to
    a specific instance, follow the server name with a backward slash and the
    instance name (e.g. serverName\sqlexpress).

connectionInfo

    An associative array that specifies options for connecting to the server.
    If values for the UID and PWD keys are not specified, the connection will
    be attempted using Windows Authentication. For a complete list of supported
    keys, see » SQLSRV Connection Options.

返回值

A connection resource. If a connection cannot be successfully opened, FALSE is
returned.

范例

Example #1 Connect using Windows Authentication.

<?php
$serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress"; //serverName\instanceName

// Since UID and PWD are not specified in the $connectionInfo array,
// The connection will be attempted using Windows Authentication.
$connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName");
$conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

if( $conn ) {
     echo "Connection established.<br />";
}else{
     echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
     die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
}
?>

Example #2 Connect by specifying a user name and password.

<?php
$serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress"; //serverName\instanceName
$connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName", "UID"=>"userName", "PWD"=>
"password");
$conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

if( $conn ) {
     echo "Connection established.<br />";
}else{
     echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
     die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
}
?>

Example #3 Connect on a specifed port.

<?php
$serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress, 1542"; //serverName\
instanceName, portNumber (default is 1433)
$connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName", "UID"=>"userName", "PWD"=>
"password");
$conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

if( $conn ) {
     echo "Connection established.<br />";
}else{
     echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
     die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
}
?>

注释

By default, the sqlsrv_connect() uses connection pooling to improve connection
performance. To turn off connection pooling (i.e. force a new connection on
each call), set the "ConnectionPooling" option in the $connectionOptions array
to 0 (or FALSE). For more information, see » SQLSRV Connection Pooling.

The SQLSRV extension does not have a dedicated function for changing which
database is connected to. The target database is specified in the
$connectionOptions array that is passed to sqlsrv_connect. To change the
database on an open connection, execute the following query "USE dbName" (e.g.
sqlsrv_query($conn, "USE dbName")).

参见

  • sqlsrv_close() - Closes an open connection and releases resourses
    associated with the connection
  • sqlsrv_errors() - Returns error and warning information about the last
    SQLSRV operation performed
  • sqlsrv_query() - Prepares and executes a query.

===============================================================================

As mentioned at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc296193.aspx the
connection will convert some data into PHP data types.  Of particular
difference to other database functions in PHP is that dates will be output as
objects instead of strings.

To make the sqlsrv_fetch_{array|object}() functions return dates/times/
datetimes as strings instead, specify:
  'ReturnDatesAsStrings' => true
in the $connectionInfo array.

For more info about this behaviour, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/

In order to connect using Windows Authentication (on Windows) for Wamp/Xamp
installations you should verify that the apache service is running under a user
who can connect to SQL Server and not under a local user.

In fact, you don't need to inform the instance name in some cases.
When I inform my the instance name of my database server, it's throws an error:
<?php
//...
$serverName = "192.168.0.11\SVDCBD01";
//...
?>
Throws:
[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 10.0]SQL Server Network Interfaces: Error
Locating Server/Instance Specified [xFFFFFFFF].

And this works as well:
<?php
//...
$serverName = "192.168.0.11";
//...
?>

dbase_get_record — Gets a record from a database as an indexed array

说明

array dbase_get_record ( int $dbase_identifier , int $record_number )

Gets a record from a database as an indexed array.

参数

dbase_identifier

    The database link identifier, returned by dbase_open() or dbase_create().

record_number

    The index of the record.

返回值

An indexed array with the record. This array will also include an associative
key named deleted which is set to 1 if the record has been marked for deletion
(see dbase_delete_record()).

Each field is converted to the appropriate PHP type, except:

  • Dates are left as strings.
  • Integers that would have caused an overflow (> 32 bits) are returned as
    strings.

On error, dbase_get_record() will return FALSE.

===============================================================================

Nowhere in the documentaiont explains that if the entire DBF file is lacking a
record for one whole column, you will not get a blank entry in your result from
dbase_get_record().  You must use dbase_get_record_with_names(), it is the only
safe way to read dbase files in PHP 4.

For example, if you have a dbase file with 12 columns, but 3 of them contain no
data in any record, then your array returned from dbase_get_record() will only
have 9 sequential array keys and values, leaving you no way to figure out which
are the missing columns.

odbc_execute

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

odbc_execute — Execute a prepared statement

说明

bool odbc_execute ( resource $result_id [, array $parameters_array ] )

Executes a statement prepared with odbc_prepare().

参数

result_id

    The result id resource, from odbc_prepare().

parameters_array

    Parameters in parameter_array will be substituted for placeholders in the
    prepared statement in order. Elements of this array will be converted to
    strings by calling this function.

    Any parameters in parameter_array which start and end with single quotes
    will be taken as the name of a file to read and send to the database server
    as the data for the appropriate placeholder.

    If you wish to store a string which actually begins and ends with single
    quotes, you must add a space or other non-single-quote character to the
    beginning or end of the parameter, which will prevent the parameter from
    being taken as a file name. If this is not an option, then you must use
    another mechanism to store the string, such as executing the query directly
    with odbc_exec()).

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 odbc_execute() and odbc_prepare() example

In the following code, $success will only be TRUE if all three parameters to
myproc are IN parameters:

<?php
$a = 1;
$b = 2;
$c = 3;
$stmt    = odbc_prepare($conn, 'CALL myproc(?,?,?)');
$success = odbc_execute($stmt, array($a, $b, $c));
?>

If you need to call a stored procedure using INOUT or OUT parameters, the
recommended workaround is to use a native extension for your database (for
example, mssql for MS SQL Server, or oci8 for Oracle).

odbc has a maximum buffer size, that means it only stores and retrieves a
limited size of data to/from database each time. The maximum buffer size is
4096 and set in php.ini (odbc.defaultlrl). You can set it to higher value for
larger data access.

I don't think odbc_prepare and odbc_execute support output parameters for
stored procedures on MSSQL.  An example of output parameters for MSSQL is at 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q174/2/23.asp

Also, my MSSQL driver seems happy only when I use the following incantation:

...code removed...
$stmt=odbc_prepare($conn_id, "exec my_proc_name ?,?,?");
$parms=array("fred","password",5);
if (!odbc_execute($stmt, &$parms)) die("odbc_execute failed");

Solid Issue:
Solid defines CHAR, VARCHAR, LONG VARCHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, and LONG
VARBINARY to be a maximum of 2G in length.  However, when creating your tables
for use with PHP one should choose LONG VARCHAR or LONG VARBINARY for these
kinds of fields if you are planning on storing really large or lengthy data. 
IE: Data exceeding 64k in length such as GIF/JPG, or really huge text areas.
===============================================================================

I've been using odbc functions for quite a while and I was floored when I
finally read the details about the how the parameters are handled when they
start and end with single quotes! I assumed that the main reason for
odbc_execute vs. odbc_exec was to prevent sql injection but apparently this
added feature actually opens another security hole, perhaps worse. This was my
fix:

<?php

function odbc_execute_clean_parameters($result_id, $parameters_array){
  for($i = 0; $i < count($parameters_array); ++$i){
    if( substr($parameters_array[$i], -1) == "'" && substr($parameters_array[$i
], 0 ,1) == "'" ){
      $parameters_array[$i].= " ";
    }
  }
  return odbc_execute($result_id, $parameters_array);
}

// then call
$stmt = odbc_prepare($conn, " insert into mytable (col1, col2) values (?, ?) "
);
$r = odbc_execute_clean_parameters($stmt, array( $val1, $val2 ) );

?>
===============================================================================

To use prepared with select queries, the right way is:
<?PHP

$rConnection = odbc_connect('AS400', 'QSECOFR', 'QSECOFR');
if($rConnection === false) {
    throw new ErrorException(odbc_errormsg());
}

$rResult = odbc_prepare($rConnection, 'SELECT * FROM KMNSH00F WHERE SHTMST > ?'
);
if($rResult === false) {
    throw new ErrorException(odbc_errormsg());
}

if(odbc_execute($rResult, array('0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000')) === false) {
    throw new ErrorException(odbc_errormsg());
}

odbc_result_all($rResult);

odbc_free_result($rResult);

odbc_close($rConnection);

?>
===============================================================================

if you can't use php_mssql module in your environment (suse linux, apache2,
php5, FreeTDS, unixODBC) an alternative is to use sql server functions instead
of procedures. here is my sample code.

<?php
  $connect        = odbc_connect($myDB, $myUser, $myPass);

  $query = "SELECT dbo.<function>(<column>,<text>) alias";

  // perform the query
  $result = odbc_exec($connect, $query);

  while(odbc_fetch_row($result)) {
    $Var1    = odbc_result($result, <column alias>);
    //echo "Var1: " . $Var1 . "<br>";

        // add additional logic

  }
?>

Once I figured this out, my app worked perfectly.

If you want to use stored procedures with MSSQL over ODBC, please read

http://www.sitepoint.com/article/php-microsoft-sql-server/2

It can you save lots of time ;)
===============================================================================

Don't miss the part where it says that if your string starts and ends with a
single quote, the string is interpreted as a filename!

This means that you can't do:

$sth = odbc_prepare($dbh, "INSERT INTO people(name) VALUES(?)");
$res = odbc_execute($sth, array($name));

without checking the value of $name--if $name is, say, '\\'c:\\passwords.txt\\
'' the contents of c:\\passwords.txt get inserted into your database as a
"name".

Also, despite what the documentation suggests, there (incredibly) doesn't
appear to be any way to escape your single quotes (via experimentation, and
from reading the source): if your string starts and ends with a single quote
you cannot use odbc_execute to insert it into the database.
===============================================================================

In reply to tcmleung at yahoo dot com (09-Nov-2001), I would add a caveat that
I've found, which is that the odbc.defaultlrl/odbc_longreadlen() values may
only apply to odbc->php conversion and not php->odbc (though this may be
database-specific). Hence, if you want to post binary data the 4096 byte limit
still stands. So you stand a better chance of being able to post binary data
using the quoted filename upload procedure described above, rather than using
the prepare... execute method with data held in a php variable.

In reply to cpoirier's note from 04-Mar-2001 03:30:

Currently, Access 2000 DOES support parametrized queries via ODBC. It still
seems to have a problem with Memo and OLE fields, but "normal" types work just
fine.
===============================================================================

When running the CGI version of 4.0.6 under windows, I came across this error
when trying to call a stored procedure in SQL Server using odbc_execute w/ the
parameter array set:

FATAL:  emalloc():  Unable to allocate 268675669 bytes

Scary error, huh? In my case it just meant that SQL Server couldn't find the
stored procedure.  Totally my fault, but a rather nondescript error message.

p.
===============================================================================

A quick note in hopes that my pain will save someone else:  Microsoft Access
ODBC drivers do not support parameterized queries.
===============================================================================

When used with parameters and the statement fails, you cannot use different
arguments anymore, the same arguments as with the failed statement will be
used.
===============================================================================

Obdc_prepare and obdc_execute can only be used as an alternative to odbc_exec
in limited circumstances:

$con = obdc_connect ($dsn, $user, $pass);
$sql = "select * from TABLE";

$result = obdc_exec ($con, $sql); //this line can be replaced as blow
//then to see results:

odbc_result_all ($result);
odbc_free_result ($result);
odbc_close ($con);

gives the same result with the middle line as:

$result = odbc_prepare ($con, $sql);
odbc_execute ($result);

as long as $sql contains a well formed and complete query.

There is no point in trying to convert this into a parameter query with
question marks as placeholders, since code like this will result only in error
messages:

$sql = "select * from TABLE where needle = ?";
$result = odbc_prepare ($con, $sql);
for ($i = 0; $i < 4; $i++)
{
  odbc_execute ($result, array ($i));
  // and whatever you want to do with the result
  // but all you get is "parameter expected" or "count does not match"
}

The lack of documentation for such functions should have been an alarm signal.
===============================================================================

I have a solution for the problem with the strings beeing interpreted as
filename because of the single quotes:

Just add a blank to the end of the string:

<?php
function odbc_escape_params ($params) {
if (!is_array($params) or empty($params)) {
  return array();
}
foreach ($params as $key=>$val) {
  if (strlen($val) > 1 and $val{0} == "'" and $val{strlen($val)-1} == "'") {
   $params[$key] .= ' ';
  }
}
return $params;
}
?>
===============================================================================

For a simple database insert to a database that has no password and $from and
$to are predefined variables.

<?php
/* get connection */
$conn=odbc_connect("mydb","","");

/* run insert */
$stmt = odbc_prepare($conn, "INSERT INTO mytable (jor_from, jor_to) VALUES('
$from', '$to');" );

/* check for errors */
if (!odbc_execute($stmt)) {
    /* error  */
    echo "Whoops";
}

/* close connection */
odbc_close($conn);
?>
===============================================================================

When odbc_execute() fails it returns FALSE and triggers a warning but it will
not necessarily feed odbc_error() and odbc_errormsg().

PDOStatement::rowCount

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7, PECL pdo >= 0.1.0)

PDOStatement::rowCount — 返回受上一个 SQL 语句影响的行数

说明

int PDOStatement::rowCount ( void )

PDOStatement::rowCount() 返回上一个由对应的 PDOStatement 对象执行DELETE、
INSERT、或 UPDATE 语句受影响的行数。

如果上一条由相关 PDOStatement 执行的 SQL 语句是一条 SELECT 语句，有些数据可能返
回由此语句返回的行数。但这种方式不能保证对所有数据有效，且对于可移植的应用不应
依赖于此方式。

返回值

返回行数。

范例

Example #1 返回删除的行数

PDOStatement::rowCount() 返回受 DELETE、INSERT、或 UPDATE 语句影响的行数。

<?php
/*  从 FRUIT 数据表中删除所有行 */
$del = $dbh->prepare('DELETE FROM fruit');
$del->execute();

/*  返回被删除的行数 */
print("Return number of rows that were deleted:\n");
$count = $del->rowCount();
print("Deleted $count rows.\n");
?>

以上例程会输出：

Return number of rows that were deleted:
Deleted 9 rows.

Example #2 计算由一个 SELECT 语句返回的行数

对于大多数数据库，PDOStatement::rowCount() 不能返回受一条 SELECT 语句影响的行数
。替代的方法是，使用 PDO::query() 来发出一条和原打算中的SELECT语句有相同条件表
达式的 SELECT COUNT(*) 语句，然后用 PDOStatement::fetchColumn() 来取得返回的行
数。这样应用程序才能正确执行。

<?php
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fruit WHERE calories > 100";
if ($res = $conn->query($sql)) {

    /* 检查符合 SELECT 语句的行数 */
  if ($res->fetchColumn() > 0) {

        /* 发出一条真正的 SELECT 语句并操作返回的结果 */
         $sql = "SELECT name FROM fruit WHERE calories > 100";
       foreach ($conn->query($sql) as $row) {
           print "Name: " .  $row['NAME'] . "\n";
         }
    }
    /* 没有匹配的行 -- 执行其他 */
  else {
      print "No rows matched the query.";
    }
}

$res = null;
$conn = null;
?>

以上例程会输出：

apple
banana
orange
pear

When updating a Mysql table with identical values nothing's really affected so
rowCount will return 0. As Mr. Perl below noted this is not always preferred
behaviour and you can change it yourself since PHP 5.3.

Just create your PDO object with
<? php
$p = new PDO($dsn, $u, $p, array(PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_FOUND_ROWS => true));
?>
and rowCount() will tell you how many rows your update-query actually found/
matched.
===============================================================================

Note that an INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement is not an INSERT
statement, rowCount won't return the number or rows inserted or updated for
such a statement.  For MySQL, it will return 1 if the row is inserted, and 2 if
it is updated, but that may not apply to other databases.
===============================================================================

Great, while using MySQL5, the only way to get the number of rows after doing a
PDO SELECT query is to either execute a separate SELECT COUNT(*) query (or to
do count($stmt->fetchAll()), which seems like a ridiculous waste of overhead
and programming time.

Another gripe I have about PDO is its inability to get the value of output
parameters from stored procedures in some DBMSs, such as SQL Server.

I'm not so sure I'm diggin' PDO yet.
===============================================================================

MySQL does not seem to return anything in rowCount for a select statement, but
you can easily and efficiently get the row count as follows:

class db extends PDO {
  public function last_row_count() {
    return $this->query("SELECT FOUND_ROWS()")->fetchColumn();
  }
}

$myDb = new db('mysql:host=myhost;dbname=mydb', 'login', 'password' );

Then, after running your query:

if ( $myDb->last_row_count() == 0 ) {
  echo "Do something!";
  }
===============================================================================

To display information only when the query is not empty, I do something like
this:

<?php
    $sql = 'SELECT model FROM cars';
    $stmt = $db->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->execute();
   
    if ($data = $stmt->fetch()) {
        do {
            echo $data['model'] . '<br>';
        } while ($data = $stmt->fetch());
    } else {
        echo 'Empty Query';
    }
?>
===============================================================================

It'd better to use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, if you only use MySQL. It has many
advantages as you could retrieve only part of result set (via LIMIT) but still
get the total row count.
code:
<?php
$db = new PDO(DSN...);
$db->setAttribute(array(PDO::MYSQL_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY=>TRUE));
$rs  = $db->query('SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM table LIMIT 5,15');
$rs1 = $db->query('SELECT FOUND_ROWS()');
$rowCount = (int) $rs1->fetchColumn();
?>
===============================================================================

every good work
If you use "INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" syntax,
mysql_affected_rows() will return you 2 if the UPDATE was made (just as it does
with the "REPLACE INTO" syntax) and 1 if the INSERT was.

So if you use one SQL request to insert several rows at a time, and some are
inserted, some are just updated, you won't get the real count.
===============================================================================

In some drivers rowCount() only works when using the prepare() with
PDO::CURSOR_SCROLL
So, you can modify PDO class:

<?php
class myPDO extends PDO
{
    function query($query, $values=null)
    {
        if($query == "")
            return false;
           
        if($sth = $this->prepare($query, array(PDO::ATTR_CURSOR => PDO::
CURSOR_SCROLL)))
        {
            $res = ($values) ? $sth->execute($values) : $sth->execute();
            if(!$res)
                return false;
        }           
        return $sth;
    }
}
?>

Now let's test (i using php 5.2.9-2):

<?php
function TestRowCount($dsn, $db_user, $db_pass)
{
    $pdh = new PDO($dsn, $db_user, $db_pass);
    $sth = $pdh->query("SELECT * FROM sys.tables");
    print "rowCount() Standart: ".$sth->rowCount()."<br>";
   
    $pdh = new myPDO($dsn, $db_user, $db_pass);
    $sth = $pdh->query("SELECT * FROM sys.tables");
    print "rowCount() New: ".$sth->rowCount()."<br><br>";
   
    $pdh=null;   
}

$db_server = "xxx";
$db_name = "xxx";
$db_user = "xxx";
$db_pass = "xxx";

print "PDO_MSSQL"."<br>";
TestRowCount("mssql:host=$db_server;dbname=$db_name", $db_user, $db_pass);

print "MSSQL throw PDO_ODBC"."<br>";
TestRowCount("odbc:DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=$db_server;DATABASE=$db_name;", 
$db_user, $db_pass);

print "MS SQL driver 2.0"."<br>";
TestRowCount("sqlsrv:server=$db_server;Database=$db_name", $db_user, $db_pass);
?>

My results:
-------------------
PDO_MSSQL
rowCount() Standart: 0
rowCount() New: 0

MSSQL throw PDO_ODBC
rowCount() Standart: -1
rowCount() New: 53

MS SQL driver 2.0
rowCount() Standart: -1
rowCount() New: 53
-------------------

With myPDO class you can use prepared queries like:
<?php
    $pdh = new myPDO($dsn, $db_user, $db_pass);
    $sth = $pdh->query("select * from data where id>? or name like ?", array(
100, "A%"));
?>

As of SQLite 3.x, the SQLite API itself changed and now all queries are
implemented using "statements".  Because of this, there is no way for PDO to
know the rowCount of a SELECT result because the SQLite API itself doesn't
offer this ability.

As a workaround, I created my own rowCount() function - it's a bit of a hack
and hasn't been fully tested yet (I don't know how it will work when using
JOINs in SELECTs, etc...), but at least alleviates the necessity for SELECT
COUNT(*)'s everywhere in your code.

I would have preferred if it were possible to overload the rowCount() function
from PDOStatement, but I don't think it's possible (or I don't know how to do
it).  There's also potential room for a bit more security ensuring that
$queryString is wiped clean after other query()s so that you don't get a bad
result, etc...

The actual code should be posted in the above/below post (max post limits,
argh!).  If others wish to extend/perfect this method, please keep me posted
with an email as to what you've done.
===============================================================================

We're having problem with these PDOStatement::fetchColumn() and
PDOStatement::rowCount(). I don't know if we have alike case to others or this
is just a problem in our coding. In local, the rowCount() is not giving the
correct number of rows but it is working fine when uploaded to our hosting
site.. while the fetchColumn() is the reverse. The fetchColumn() is working
fine in local but not anymore when uploaded. I don't know what is really going
on with that but I think rowCount() is the best and the others are optional to
use.
===============================================================================

Yet another workaround to return the row count inside only ONE select (see
limitations below!):

$sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT *,count(*) AS howmany FROM users WHERE email
=:email and password=:pass"); #var placeholders
$sth->execute(array(':email'=>$email, ':pass'=>$pass)); #var binding
$row = $sth->fetch(); #get one row (it'll always be one and only one!!!)

if ($row['howmany'] == 1){ #we have a match and only one! cool!
    echo $row['email'], $row['name'], $row['phone'], ... ;
} elseif ($row['howmany']>1) { #more than one row returned
    #one programmer should be fired 'cause he's not checking for
    #for existing emails, before creating a new user
    ...
    # treat this exception somehow or simply skip this branch,
    # if you're sure it won't happen in your table
} else { #no match in the table ($row['howmany'] == 0)
    echo "Email/pass didn't match the ones in the database!";
}

Advantages:
- only one select statement is executed, no two steps needed!
- it checks if one row exists in the table or not, according to the WHERE
clause.
- it returns all (or only a selection of) fields for that one row, if exists.

Disadvantages:
- it doesn't return row fields reliable if more than one row found. If more
than one row responds to the SELECT query, the query returns still only one row
and you don't know which one exactly .
Maybe using a SORT BY, would make it a bit more predictible (as in: "if more
than one users found, return the last user added in the table") but it's more a
matter of good design of the program that fills in the table initially.

Uses:
- It is perfect for checking if a user/pass pair is present in a users table
and to return the other fields of the user (like name, phone, whatever) if user
was found.

Well, I woundn't do as suggested querying twice the database to get the count
and then get the data I want. It would be simpler and would give better
performance to query once and retrieve both, record count and the data itself

<?php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM fruit WHERE calories > :calories";
$sth = $conn->prepare($sql);
$sth->bindParam(':calories', 100, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$res = $sth->execute();
if ($res) {
    $record = $sth->fetchAll();
    /* Check the number of rows that match the SELECT statement */
    if (count($record) > 0) {
        foreach ($record as $row) {
            print "Name: " .  $row['NAME'] . "\n";
         }
    }
    /* No rows matched -- do something else */
  else {
      print "No rows matched the query.";
    }
}
$conn = null;
?>
===============================================================================

My rowCount() workaround & how it's used:

<?php
class MyPDO extends PDO {
    private $queryString;

    public function query(/* ... */) {
        $args = func_get_args();
        $this->queryString = func_get_arg(0);

        return call_user_func_array(array(&$this, 'parent::query'), $args);
    }

    public function rowCount() {
        $regex = '/^SELECT\s+(?:ALL\s+|DISTINCT\s+)?(?:.*?)\s+FROM\s+(.*)$/i';
        if (preg_match($regex, $this->queryString, $output) > 0) {
            $stmt = parent::query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {$output[1]}", PDO::
FETCH_NUM);

            return $stmt->fetchColumn();
        }

        return false;
    }
}

$pdo = new MyPDO("sqlite::memory:");
$result = $pdo->query("SELECT row1, row2 FROM table WHERE something = 5");

if ($pdo->rowCount() > 0) {
    echo "{$result['row1']}, {$result['row2']}";
}
?>

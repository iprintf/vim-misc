time_nanosleep

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

time_nanosleep — 延缓执行若干秒和纳秒

说明

mixed time_nanosleep ( int $seconds , int $nanoseconds )

程序延缓执行指定数量的 seconds 和 nanoseconds。

参数

seconds

    必须是一个非负整数。

nanoseconds

    必须是一个小于1亿的非负整数。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

如果延迟被中断，一个关联数组会返回，内容为：

  • seconds - 延迟剩余未执行的秒数
  • nanoseconds - 延迟剩余未执行的纳秒数

更新日志

版本                 说明
5.3.0 至此之后该函数在Windows平台下可用。

范例

Example #1 time_nanosleep() 的例子

<?php
// Careful! This won't work as expected if an array is returned
if (time_nanosleep(0, 500000000)) {
    echo "Slept for half a second.\n";
}

// This is better:
if (time_nanosleep(0, 500000000) === true) {
    echo "Slept for half a second.\n";
}

// And this is the best:
$nano = time_nanosleep(2, 100000);

if ($nano === true) {
    echo "Slept for 2 seconds, 100 microseconds.\n";
} elseif ($nano === false) {
    echo "Sleeping failed.\n";
} elseif (is_array($nano)) {
    $seconds = $nano['seconds'];
    $nanoseconds = $nano['nanoseconds'];
    echo "Interrupted by a signal.\n";
    echo "Time remaining: $seconds seconds, $nanoseconds nanoseconds.";
}
?>

Just glancing at this - and the note from over a year ago with a implementation
for windows.. with 5.0.0 and higher it would be simplier to just do something
like......

<?php

if (!function_exists('time_nanosleep')) {

function time_nanosleep($seconds, $nanoseconds) {

sleep($seconds);
usleep(round($nanoseconds/100));

return true;

}

}

?>

....off the top of my head - obviously simple enough there should be no
mistakes.. but those are the ones that always seem to get ya :( .....
===============================================================================

A response to the note below:

Your function is also useless, as the WinNT 32 kernel only functions at a
minimum of about 10+ ms (1,000 us), rendering usleep() useless, because usleep
uses the C function which is provided by the system (in this case,
kernel32.dll).

You'll want to use a function that does not rely on the kernel, but rather
something made for precise measurement:

<?php
function usleep_win( $micro_seconds )
{
    if ( @function_exists( "socket_create" ) && @function_exists( 
"socket_select" ) )
    {
        $false = NULL;
        $socket = array( socket_create( AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, $false ) );
        socket_select( $false, $false, $socket, 0, $micro_seconds );
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}
?>

This function will allow to you sleep for a specified microsecond, although I
have measured it to be off by ~5 us.

Again, most of this depends on the hardware in your system. If you _REALLY_
need to be precise to < 10 us, you shouldn't be using WinNT anyways!
===============================================================================

You should take into account, if you use the function replacement down here,
the CPU will be in use of 99% for the time of execution...

(A little bit better in this situation is to let the 'full seconds' go by a
normal sleep command (makes the thread sleep!, and uses minimum cpu))

<?php
    //THIS IS THE FUNCTION WE ARE TALKIN ABOUT
    function timeWait($microtime)
    {
//optimizations added by me [start]
//sleep the full seconds
sleep(intval($microtime));
//set the microtime to only resleep the last part of the nanos
$microtime = $microtime - intval($microtime);
//optimizations added by me [end]

        $timeLimit = $microtime + array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
        while(array_sum(explode(" ",microtime())) < $timeLimit)
        {/*DO NOTHING*/}
        return(true);
    }

    //THIS IS HOW WE CAN USE IT
    echo "Process started at " . date("H:i:s") . " and " . current(explode(" ",
microtime())) . " nanoseconds.<br>";
    timeWait(5.5); //With this call the system will wait 5 seconds and a half.
You can use either integer or float.
    echo "Process completed at " . date("H:i:s") . " and " . current(explode("
",microtime())) . " nanoseconds.";
?>
===============================================================================

Documentation states that "seconds" must be positive. This is not correct, 0 is
possible.

Rather, "seconds" must be non-negative.
===============================================================================

This is an alternative function to sleep_nanosecond that you can use with PHP
versions below PHP 5.0. It is not very accurate if we talk about nanoseconds
but the results are satisfatory. Enjoy!

<?php
    //THIS IS THE FUNCTION WE ARE TALKIN ABOUT
    function timeWait($microtime)
    {
        $timeLimit = $microtime + array_sum(explode(" ",microtime()));
        while(array_sum(explode(" ",microtime())) < $timeLimit)
        {/*DO NOTHING*/}
        return(true);
    }

    //THIS IS HOW WE CAN USE IT
    echo "Process started at " . date("H:i:s") . " and " . current(explode(" ",
microtime())) . " nanoseconds.<br>";
    timeWait(5.5); //With this call the system will wait 5 seconds and a half.
You can use either integer or float.
    echo "Process completed at " . date("H:i:s") . " and " . current(explode("
",microtime())) . " nanoseconds.";
?>

You can use here-documents in PHP but not for printing to a file pointer.

There's a lot to say on them so just go to the page: http://www.php.net/manual/
language.types.string.php

Adding to Adam (Nedstat):
fputs without the length parm just writes all data up to but not including the
first 0 byte it encounters.

Therefore fputs($fp,"hello\0world") will only write hello to $fp whereas
fputs($fp,"hello\0world",11) will write both words.

If this doesn't make sense for you, remember strings are always terminated with
that 0 byte. Binary data doesn't have such a terminator byte as a 0 byte can be
a completely valid piece of data therefore you always need to know the length
of the binary datapart.

BTW strlen() is binary safe, so you can use that to get the length of the
binary data part as well - this is different from C which counts the number of
chars up to the 0 byte. So the example above could also be written as:

fputs($fp,"hello\0world",strlen("hello\0world"))

This will create a visitor count for your webpage

<?php

$filename = 'sitevisitors.txt';

if (file_exists($filename))
    {
        $count = file('sitevisitors.txt');
        $count[0] ++;
        $fp = fopen("sitevisitors.txt", "w");
        fputs ($fp, "$count[0]");
        fclose ($fp);
        echo $count[0];
    }

else
    {
        $fh = fopen("sitevisitors.txt", "w");
        if($fh==false)
            die("unable to create file");
        fputs ($fh, 1);
        fclose ($fh);
        $count = file('sitevisitors.txt');
        echo $count[0];
    }

?>
===============================================================================

The way I understand fputs (which is purported as an alias to fwrite which can
be "Binary Safe")...

<?php
$fp = fopen("something.txt","w");
$string = "Hello World\\n";  // escape the slash from being magically
// being transformed into a newline
fwrite($fp, $string); // will proccess /n as newline ...
fwrite($fp, $string, strlen($string)); // will write the entire string to file
without changing the '/n'
// into a single byte for newline on Unix-like machines or CR/LF on Win32
machines
?>

Hope this helps explain the definition of "could be Binary Safe". This is the
reason why you must specify the length!

===============================================================================

Length is required if you are writing out a lot of data.  For instance, if you
are base64 decoding an email attachment and writing it out to a file you have
to specify the length if the file is over a certian size or else the binary
data will be corrupt.

fputs($fp,$binary,strlen($binary));

Will yield the desired results.

When tested with a 1k the length wasn't required but with a larger file, around
27k it needs the length to work properly.

This might seem silly for experienced users, but this bugged me for about two
hours (searching and trying to debug the damn thing).

If you're on a Windows system doing tests on a Linux/Apache setup, and you're
writing stuff to a text file (then load that file to see if your content is
being written properly) and you realize only your first string is in there,
your problem is not your Windows, not Linux and not Apache. It's probably Samba
(the thing that makes it possible for your Linux and Windows boxes to talk to
each other) that's caching your file... Try viewing your file via telnet or
simply copy your file then read that copy.

You can see content is being written to your file anyway, because even though
you don't see your new content (using notepad for example), you do see your
filesize increasing as you add more text to your file.

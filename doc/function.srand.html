srand — 播下随机数发生器种子

说明

void srand ([ int $seed ] )

用 seed 播下随机数发生器种子。seed 参数没有给出时，会被设为随时数。

    Note: 自 PHP 4.2.0 起，不再需要用 srand() 或 mt_srand() 给随机数发生器播种
    ，因为现在是由系统自动完成的。

参数

seed

    可选的种子值

返回值

没有返回值。

更新日志

   版本                      说明
Since 4.2.0 seed 成为可选，省略时会默认使用随机值。

范例

Example #1 srand() 例子

<?php
// seed with microseconds
function make_seed()
{
  list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
  return (float) $sec + ((float) $usec * 100000);
}
srand(make_seed());
$randval = rand();
?>

Keep in mind that the Suhosin patch which is installed by default on many
PHP-installs such as Debian and DirectAdmin completely disables the srand and
mt_srand functions for encryption security reasons. To generate reproducible
random numbers from a fixed seed on a Suhosin-hardened server you will need to
include your own pseudorandom generator code.
===============================================================================

To generate a random number which is different every day, I used the number of
days after unix epoch as a seed:

<?php 
   srand(floor(time() / (60*60*24)));
   echo rand() % 100;
?>

My provider upgraded the php server recently, and calling srand(seed) does not
seem to set the seed anymore. To let srand set the seed, add the following line
to your .htaccess file

php_value suhosin.srand.ignore 0

srand() is pretty tricky to get right. You should never seed a random number
generator more than once per php process, if you do, your randomness is limited
to the source of your seed.

The microtime function's micro-seconds portion has a very finite resolution,
that is why the make_seed function was added to the document. You should never
get the same seed twice.

In the later CVS versions, PHP will seed the random generator prior to
performing a rand() if srand() was not previously called.
===============================================================================

It is REALLY essential to make sure that srand is called only once.
This is a bit difficult if the call is hidden somewhere in third-party code you
include. For example, I used a standard banner script that *seemed* to work
well putting
three random banners in one frame. But in the long run, the choice appeared
somewhat biased - probably because srand was called once per banner, not
once per run.
It would be nice if the random number generator worked like in PERL: If You use
the random function without having called srand ever before in a script,
srand is invoked before (and automatically with a nice seed, hopefully).
I suggest that one should do something like this:

<?php
if (!$GLOBALS["IHaveCalledSrandBefore"]++) {
  srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);
}
?>

(Depending on the situation, one might also work with a static variable
instead)
===============================================================================

Sorry about that...  ok, forget have of what I said up there ^.

The code that would prove my example is this:

<?php
srand(5);
echo(rand(1, 10));
srand(5);
echo(rand(1, 10));
srand(5);
echo(rand(1, 10));
?>

Each time you SHOULD get the same answer, but if you did this:

<?php
srand(5);
echo(rand(1, 10));
echo(rand(1, 10));
echo(rand(1, 10));
?>

then the answers would be different, and you'd be letting the random number
formula do it's duty.
===============================================================================

OK, to summarize what people have been saying so far:

1. DO NOT seed the RNG more than once if you can help it!
2. You HAVE TO seed the RNG yourself if you are using PHP < 4.2.0.
3. Using a prime multiplier to microtime() probably does very little. Use the
Mersenne Twister instead.
4. You can use the Mersenne Twister PRNG with the mt_rand and mt_srand
functions. This is faster and is more random.
===============================================================================

srand and mt_srand are both initialized only once per process ID.

You cannot re-seed your rand algorithms after the first "srand", "mt_srand",
"rand", "mt_rand", "shuffle", or any other rand-like function.

I have been facing an issue where after forking my process, all childs were
generating exactly the same rand values.
This was due a first "shuffle" call on the parent process, so I could not
re-seed the childs.

To solve my issue, I simple called "rand" N times, to offset the child rand
generators.

# Offset the child rand generator by its PID
$n = (getmypid() % 100) * (10 * abs(microtime(true) - time()));
for ($n; $n > 0; $n--) {
      rand(0, $n);
}

Since each pcntl_fork takes a while to be completed, the microtime offers an
extra offset, other than one PID increment.

This small code will make at the WORST hypothesis 1000 iterations.
===============================================================================

I have a ramdon circulater that changes a piece of text once a day, and I use
the following code to make sure the see is unique enough.

$tm = time();
$today = mktime(0, 0, 0, (int)date("n", $tm), (int)date("j", $tm), (int)date
("Y", $tm));                                                  
srand($today / pi());

The pi works wonders for the whole thing and it works like a charm. Any other
big decimal number will do as well, but pi is the most common "big" number.
===============================================================================

Another use of srand is to obtain the same value of rand in a determined time
interval. Example: you have an array of 100 elements and you need to obtain a
random item every day but not to change in the 24h period (just imagine
"Today's Photo" or similar).
<?php
$seed = floor(time()/86400);
srand($seed);
$item = $examplearray[rand(0,99)];
?>
You obtain the same value every time you load the page all the 24h period.
===============================================================================

I simply use this, and it has always worked fine:

function initRand ()
{
    static $randCalled = FALSE;
    if (!$randCalled)
    {
        srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);
        $randCalled = TRUE;
    }
}
function randNum ($low, $high)
{
    initRand();
    $rNum = rand($low, $high);
    return $rNum;
}
===============================================================================

In addition to my earlier post being stupidly coded with $wasseeded = TRUE :-|
here is an update:

In PHP4, I *BELIEVE* the random number generator will seed itself if you don't
seed it.

In PHP3, or some versions of PHP3?, that was not the case -- An unseeded rand()
wouldn't be random.

While it would "work fine" in terms of spitting out a number, an unseeded
random number generator won't be very random in many situations unless it has
been properly seeded.

I'm afraid I can't explain all the details of why this is because A) it would
be an entire textbook, and B) I don't know them all by heart, even if I
understood them 20 years ago in college.

If you are running PHP4, you are probably okay, and if you are happy with the
randomness of your values, you are fine, but you may want to do a little test
like:

<?php
  $stats[1] = 0;
  $stats[2] = 0;
  $stats[3] = 0;
  for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++){
    $choice = rand(1,3);
    if (!$i){
      echo "First random choice: $choice<BR>\n";
    }
    $stats[$choice]++;
  }
  reset($stats);
  while (list($num, $count) = each($stats)){
    echo "$num: $count<BR>\n";
  }
?>

Run the test a half-dozen times and check that the distribution of 1, 2, and 3
is even, and that the first number chosen is not the same every time.

This is hardly an exhaustive test, but it at least gives some reassurance that
the numbers aren't completely predictable.

You may also wish to switch to http://php.net/mt_rand which is faster (if you
generate a *LOT* of numbers) and allegedly a "better" (more random) function.

Again, it would be an entire book to explain why mt_rand is "more random"...

YMMV.  If you're doing "Casino Slots" with real money, you'd better do your
homework on this.  If you're giving away a free CD or something silly, who
cares?
===============================================================================

The make_seed() function in the example code is VERY bad, and is in fact
responsible for seeding always the same value, so that the output of rand() is
the same with every page reload (!)

ALWAYS use:
(double)microtime()*1000000

See for more details my note on the mt_srand() page [ function.mt_srand.php ]
===============================================================================

How about<br>
<?
srand((double)microtime()*1000000);
$seed = rand(1000000,9999999);
srand((double)microtime()*$seed);
$yadda = rand (1,100);
?><br>
I used this in a test run with 1,000.000 calls for $yadda. Processing time
increased by 0.0000061 seconds compared to a simple "srand((double)microtime()
*1000000);"
$yadda had the value of each number between 1 and 100 for between 0.99999122%
and 1.00000872% of all calls. That's random and fast enough for me. :)
===============================================================================

As a sidenote on the usage of srand():

If you are making use of modular programming, it is probably better to try and
call the srand routine from the parent script than from any modules you may be
using (using REQUIRE or INCLUDE).
This way you get around the possibility of calling srand() more than once from
different modules.

The flaw in this solution, of course, is when using modules produced by another
programmer, or when producing modules for another programmer.
You cannot rely on another programmer calling the srand function before calling
the modular function, so you would have to include the srand function inside
the module in this case.

If you produce modules for use by other programmers then it is good practice to
documentise the fact you have already called the srand function.
Or if you use a modular function produced by someone else, check their
documentation, or check their source code.
===============================================================================

Use the srand() seed "(double)microtime()*1000000" as mentioned by the
richard@zend.com at the top of these user notes.

The most notable effect of using any other seed is that your random numbers
tend to follow the same, or very similar, sequences each time the script is
invoked.

Take note of the following script:

<?php
  srand($val);

  echo rand(0, 20) . ", ";
  echo rand(0, 20) . ", ";
  echo rand(0, 20) . ", ";
  echo rand(0, 20) . ", ";
  echo rand(0, 20);
?>

If you seed the generator with a constant, say; the number 5 ($val = 5), then
the sequence generated is always the same, in this case (0, 18, 7, 15, 17) (for
me at least, different processors/processor speeds/operating systems/OS
releases/PHP releases/webserver software may generate different sequences).

If you seed the generator with time(), then the sequence is more random, but
invokations that are very close together will have similar outputs.

As richard@zend.com above suggests, the best seed to use is (double) microtime
() * 1000000, as this gives the greatest amount of psuedo-randomness. In fact,
it is random enough to suit most users.
In a test program of 100000 random numbers between 1 and 20, the results were
fairly balanced, giving an average of 5000 results per number, give or take
100. The deviation in each case varied with each invokation.
===============================================================================

Calling srand((double)microtime()*1000000),
then $a=rand(1000000,9999999), then srand((double)microtime()*$a)
adds nothing to the entrophy: the execution time of rand and srand is
constant, so the second microtime() produces nothing really fascinating. You
may safely use just the first srand().
===============================================================================

I can’t stress how important it is to seed your randomisation process in code!
better still something we found in the BBS Days was if we didn’t seed from a
token from outside our systems abstraction layer we would go in circles and so
would our users. Here at chronolabs we offer a feed of randomly changing token
on each impression, it also randomly displays a different number of them this
is from http://seed.feeds.labs.coop in the example below I use DOM to load the
XML, Extract the randomisation tokens and then with mt_srand and srand seed the
random selecting processes! The following function when you call it will seed
your random selection process in both the old and new random selection routines
all you need to do is call the function! This will work with any version of PHP
5 and any earlier with DOM Objectivity.

function makeRandomSeeded() {
    $file = 'http://seed.feeds.labs.coop/';
    $doc = new DOMDocument();
    $doc->loadHTMLFile($file);
    $skip = array('This feed can', 'Current mode is');
    $elements = $doc->getElementsByTagName('description');
    foreach($elements as $element) {
        $seed = $element->nodeValue;
        $found = false;
        foreach($skip as $find) {
            if (substr($seed, 0, strlen($find))==$find) {
                $found = true;
            }
        }
        if ($found==false)
            $seeds[] = $seed;
    }
    shuffle($seeds);
    mt_srand($seeds[mt_rand(0, count($seeds)-1)]);
    srand($seeds[mt_rand(0, count($seeds)-1)]);
}

Remember when PHP says an integer this also include any character of the Ascii
chart if you would like to see an example of this do the following:

<?php
   $a = "000A";
   while($a!="001B") {
      echo $a;
      $a++;
   }
?>
===============================================================================

Something we discovered in Sydney running BBS Systems before the net advent was
here, if we didn't seed of another BBS we would going in circles in our System
Physicality Abstraction Layers.. The important thing is to seed from a remote
system and easy way at the Centroidal Plexus of the web (Chronolabs
Cooperative) we offer a seed feed and the following code will randomise you out
of the number cycle:

See in PHP both the letters and numbers are seedable as letters are treated as
numbers as well. You can always use individual tokens by extracting the Element
with DOM.. But below is equally effective!

<?php

srand(file_get_contents('http://seed.feeds.labs.coop'));

?>

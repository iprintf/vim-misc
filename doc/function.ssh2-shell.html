Do not use \n to end the command. Some server will fail to process. Use always
the standard for PHP end of line: PHP_EOL

'suri at suribala dot com"'s example should be modified as follows (also change
the double quotes to single, for better performance):

<?php

$con=ssh2_connect('192.168.0.1', 22);
ssh2_auth_password($con, 'user', 'password');
$shell=ssh2_shell($con, 'xterm');
fwrite( $shell, 'cd /dir_one;'.PHP_EOL);
fwrite( $shell, 'ls -la;'.PHP_EOL);
fwrite( $shell, 'cd /dir_two;'.PHP_EOL);
fwrite( $shell, 'ls -la;'.PHP_EOL);

?>

To run a shell script with all the variables that you would have when logged in
interactively add bash -l or sh --login infront of your command.  The script I
use creates a shell script, copies the script to the box with ssh2_scp_send,
then executes the script with ssh2_exec.  Hope this helps somebody.

<?php

//Example

$script1 = "bash -l /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart";

$connection = ssh2_connect('shell.example.com', 22);
ssh2_auth_password($connection, 'username', 'password');

$stream = ssh2_exec($connection, $script1);
?>
===============================================================================

Keep in mind that when using ssh2_shell, the remote system's EOL may not be the
same as PHP's EOL, so it may not be safe to use PHP_EOL. The native EOL for
Windows is \r\n, while Unix is typically merely \n, and classic Mac for some
reason is \r.

If you're running PHP on Windows (\r\n) and sshing into a Unix box (\n) you're
going to end up sending extra lines. My experience so far is that it just acts
as though you typed nothing, which may cause issues with password prompts.

Oh, and \n\r? Don't do that. Nobody does that.

In response to webmaster at spectreanime dot com:

"For some obscur reasons, just after ur command, u need to make a sleep to be
sure, that the command has reached the server and is running"

Actually what you must do is set the blocking of the string to true, so it
waits until the server sends data to the STDOUT before echoing it.

So, instead of:

sleep(1);

Just do:

stream_set_blocking($stdio, true);

Hi,

we could also use shell_exec to execute multiple related commands
separated by semicolon (;).

And I figured out  problem that sometimes arise related to the execution of
complex java c/c++ programs. All we need to do is to set the required
environment variables. I have a environment variable in .bash_profile. This
variable would be set when I log into my account normally through shell. But
when we use ssh2_connect(), the environment variables in the .bash_profile are
not set, all we need to do is export the required environment variables with
shell_exec();

example:

$conn = ssh2_connect($ipaddress);
ssh2_auth_password($conn,$username,$passwd);
$cmd1="/path/to/program1";
$cmd2="/path/to/program2";
$env1="export Variable_name1=path1";
$env2="export Variable_name2=path2"
$stream = ssh2_exec($connection,"$env1; $env2; $cmd1; $cmd2");//this would
execute all the //commands and return
// stream
stream_set_blocking($stream, true);
while($o=fgets($stream)){
echo $o.'<br>';
}

...

Instead of using sleep(1) try using usleep(350000). If not, you will need to
spend much time unnecessary. In my scripts, I tried to use usleep(250000), but
it's too short and brought some problems. usleep(300000) worked, but only to
garantee use 350000. ;)

Using ssh_exec, one could execute only one command at a time. However,
ssh_shell, offers greater flexibility.

Here is an example:

<?php

$con=ssh2_connect('192.168.0.1', 22);
ssh2_auth_password($con, "user", "password");
$shell=ssh2_shell($con, 'xterm');
fwrite( $shell, "cd /dir_one\n");
fwrite( $shell, "ls -la\n");
fwrite( $shell, "cd /dir_two\n");
fwrite( $shell, "ls -la\n");

?>

Thanks Sara for your implementation and your help !

In my case the ssh2_shell doesn't work every time. There were many problems:
- If I use stream_get_contents, the command(s) never executed
- with while ($buf = fgets...) the loop never stops
- without sleep(1) before stream_set_blocking, the command wasn't execute every
time. Anyone knows why?
That's what I made, and it works - but I think it isn't what it should be:
<?php
        $strCommand = 'tar -C /path/to/extract -xjf /path/from/file.tar.bz2';
        $sshStream = ssh2_shell($this->sshSession, 'xterm', null, 120, 24, 
SSH2_TERM_UNIT_CHARS);
        fwrite($sshStream, $strCommand . PHP_EOL);
        sleep(1);
        stream_set_blocking($sshStream, true);
        $sshUntarRetval = "";
        while ($buf = fgets($sshStream,4096)) {
        flush();
            $sshUntarRetval .= $buf;
            if (strpos($buf, 'tar -C') !== false)
            {
                break;
            }
        }
        fclose($sshStream);
?>

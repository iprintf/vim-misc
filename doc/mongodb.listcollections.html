MongoDB::listCollections

(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

MongoDB::listCollections — Gets an array of MongoCollection objects for all
collections in this database

说明

public array MongoDB::listCollections ([ array $options = array() ] )

Gets a list of all collections in the database and returns them as an array of
MongoCollection objects.

    Note: This method will use the » listCollections database command when
    communicating with MongoDB 2.8+. For previous database versions, the method
    will query the special system.namespaces collection.

参数

options

    An array of options for listing the collections. Currently available
    options include:
      □ "filter"

        Optional query criteria. If provided, this criteria will be used to
        filter the collections included in the result.

        Relevant fields that may be queried include "name" (collection name as
        a string, without the database name prefix) and "options" (object
        containing options used to create the collection)..

            Note: MongoDB 2.6 and earlier versions require the "name" criteria,
            if specified, to be a string value (i.e. equality match). This is
            because the driver must prefix the value with the database name in
            order to query the system.namespaces collection. Later versions of
            MongoDB do not have this limitation, as the driver will use the
            listCollections command.

      □ "includeSystemCollections"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Determines whether system collections
        should be included in the result.

    The following option may be used with MongoDB 2.8+:
      □ "maxTimeMS"

        Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing the
        operation on the server (does not include idle time). If the operation
        is not completed by the server within the timeout period, a
        MongoExecutionTimeoutException will be thrown.

返回值

Returns an array of MongoCollection objects.

错误／异常

For MongoDB 2.6 and earlier, MongoException will be thrown if a non-string
value was specified for the "filter" option's "name" criteria.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
1.6.0 Changed first parameter to be an array of options. Pre-1.6.0, the first
      parameter was a boolean indicating the "includeSystemCollections" option.
1.3.0 Added the includeSystemCollections parameter.

范例

Example #1 MongoDB::listCollections() example

The following example demonstrates running count on each collection in a
database.

<?php

$m = new MongoClient();
$db = $m->selectDB("demo");
$collections = $db->listCollections();

foreach ($collections as $collection) {
    echo "amount of documents in $collection: ";
    echo $collection->count(), "\n";
}

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

...
amount of documents in demo.pubs: 4
amount of documents in demo.elephpants: 3
amount of documents in demo.cities: 22840
...

===============================================================================

For an alternative to the shell command 'show dbs', refer to my note for the
listDBs() method of Mongoclient(), which reproduces some simple PHP code that
will yield the names of all database present.

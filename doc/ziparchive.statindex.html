ZipArchive::statIndex

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PHP 7, PECL zip >= 1.1.0)

ZipArchive::statIndex — Get the details of an entry defined by its index.

说明

array ZipArchive::statIndex ( int $index [, int $flags ] )

The function obtains information about the entry defined by its index.

参数

index

    Index of the entry

flags

    ZipArchive::FL_UNCHANGED may be ORed to it to request information about the
    original file in the archive, ignoring any changes made.

返回值

Returns an array containing the entry details 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 Dump the stat info of an entry

<?php
$zip = new ZipArchive;
$res = $zip->open('test.zip');
if ($res === TRUE) {
    print_r($zip->statIndex(3));
    $zip->close();
} else {
    echo 'failed, code:' . $res;
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [name] => foobar/baz
    [index] => 3
    [crc] => 499465816
    [size] => 27
    [mtime] => 1123164748
    [comp_size] => 24
    [comp_method] => 8
)

===============================================================================

Note that the 'mtime' field only comes from the DOS-format time that's stored
in the zip file, which is only accurate to the nearest 2-seconds.  Zip files
can store mtime's in multiple, optional fields but PHP's zip library does not
retrieve them (nor does it provide API to access the extra fields)

The end result is that you will see timestamps that could be out by one second
(if the original timestamp was odd), and won't necessarily match was other
unzip programs will show the mtime as.
===============================================================================

Note that the signed-integer CRC result is only true on 32-bit systems. 64-bit
systems return correct CRCs.

A safer way (as recommended by crc32() function page) might be:

if ($file['crc'] < 0)
   $file['crc'] = sprintf("%u",$file['crc']);
===============================================================================

The CRC returned from this method is a signed number and so can be negative.
This isn't how most CRC's are represented and so can cause problems. Another
thing to know is that the standerd CRC algorithm used for zip files is CRC32b.

So to put this together lets say that you wanted to extract the first file from
a zip and then compare the original CRC with the CRC for the extracted file
this is what you would need to do. (proper error checking is omitted for
simplicity).

<?php
$zip = new ZipArchive();

$zip->open("myZip.zip");

$stat = $zip->statIndex( 0 );

$name = $stat['name'];

$oldCrc = $stat['crc'];

$zip->extractTo("myPath", $name);

$newCrc = hexdec(hash_file("crc32b", "myPath/" . $name));

// Have to test both cases as the unsigned CRC from within the zip might appear
negative as a signed int.
if($newCrc !== $oldCrc && ($oldCrc + 4294967296) !== $newCrc) {
    echo "The files don't match!";
}
?>

===============================================================================

This is a quote from the DOM level 2 spec, explaining the normalize() function.
----
normalize
Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node,
including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g.,
elements, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity
references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes
nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a
document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when
operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular
document tree structure are to be used.

(source: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html)

i.e. the idea of normalize is to make text nodes the same as they would be if
the xml document was re-loaded into DOM. It's handy if you want to compare DOM
nodes.

EvTimer::again — Restarts the timer watcher

说明

public void EvTimer::again ( void )

This will act as if the timer timed out and restart it again if it is
repeating. The exact semantics are:

 1. if the timer is pending, its pending status is cleared.

 2. if the timer is started but non-repeating, stop it (as if it timed out).

 3. if the timer is repeating, either start it if necessary (with the repeat
    value), or reset the running timer to the repeat value.

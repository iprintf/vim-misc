SQLiteDatabase::lastInsertRowid

(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_last_insert_rowid -- SQLiteDatabase::lastInsertRowid — Returns the rowid
of the most recently inserted row

说明

int sqlite_last_insert_rowid ( resource $dbhandle )

面向对象风格 (method):

public int SQLiteDatabase::lastInsertRowid ( void )

Returns the rowid of the row that was most recently inserted into the database
dbhandle, if it was created as an auto-increment field.

Tip

You can create auto-increment fields in SQLite by declaring them as INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY in your table schema.

参数

dbhandle

    The SQLite Database resource; returned from sqlite_open() when used
    procedurally. This parameter is not required when using the object-oriented
    method.

返回值

Returns the row id, as an integer.

===============================================================================

Note that you don't need to create a primary key for your table. In the absence
of an integer primary key, SQLite simply uses an internal key called "RowID" or
"OID".
It has all of the features of a normal integer primary key(auto-incrementing,
returned by sqlite_last_insert_rowid(), accessible via SELECT, etc), except
that it's handled better by SQLite and doesn't require the extra characters in
the "CREATE" command.
If you just want a primary key as an auto-incrementing ID for your rows, save
yourself the trouble and just use "OID" instead.

Also, according to the SQLite website, the id returned is for the last insert
in the current *connection*, not just database. This means that if there are
two connections to the same database at the same time, and both perform
"INSERT", each can get it's own inserted rowid later, so basically this is
thread-safe(So long as no-one calls "REINDEX").
===============================================================================

Note that if you insret a few rows in your table, say rowid 1-5, and then
delete 2,3 and 4, you will be left with the rowids 1 and 5, not 1 and 2. This
may seem basic to anyone with database experience, but I had to check it out
with a GUI tool before I figured this one out. Anyway, what it boils down to is
that sometimes your rowid will be greater than the number returned by the
SQLite COUNT (*) function.
===============================================================================

I have noticed that this will still return an insert id even if a table has not
been assigned a primary key or has not been assigned a primary key correctly.
If the table was not created correctly sqlite_last_insert_rowid() will return
its internal row id, which is probably not what you want. The correct way to
establish a primary key migh look something like this look something like this:

create table some_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, some_field varchar(10))

Then you can try:

insert into some_table (some_field) values ('bob')

You will see that an id will be automatically generated and
calling sqlite_last_insert_rowid() will return the expected value

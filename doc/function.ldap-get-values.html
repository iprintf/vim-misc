ldap_get_values

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ldap_get_values — Get all values from a result entry

说明

array ldap_get_values ( resource $link_identifier , resource
$result_entry_identifier , string $attribute )

Reads all the values of the attribute in the entry in the result.

This call needs a result_entry_identifier, so needs to be preceded by one of
the ldap search calls and one of the calls to get an individual entry.

You application will either be hard coded to look for certain attributes (such
as "surname" or "mail") or you will have to use the ldap_get_attributes() call
to work out what attributes exist for a given entry.

参数

link_identifier

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

result_entry_identifier

attribute

返回值

Returns an array of values for the attribute on success and FALSE on error. The
number of values can be found by indexing "count" in the resultant array.
Individual values are accessed by integer index in the array. The first index
is 0.

LDAP allows more than one entry for an attribute, so it can, for example, store
a number of email addresses for one person's directory entry all labeled with
the attribute "mail"

    return_value["count"] = number of values for attribute
    return_value[0] = first value of attribute
    return_value[i] = ith value of attribute


范例

Example #1 List all values of the "mail" attribute for a directory entry

<?php
// $ds is a valid link identifier for a directory server

// $sr is a valid search result from a prior call to
//     one of the ldap directory search calls

// $entry is a valid entry identifier from a prior call to
//        one of the calls that returns a directory entry

$values = ldap_get_values($ds, $entry, "mail");

echo $values["count"] . " email addresses for this entry.<br />";

for ($i=0; $i < $values["count"]; $i++) {
    echo $values[$i] . "<br />";
}
?>

===============================================================================

It wasn't immediately obvious to me that the ldap_get_values function does not
work with binary data - only strings.  If you fetch binary data with
ldap_get_values you don't get a warning - just some trash.  For binary data you
have to use ldap_get_values_len.
===============================================================================

Well this took me a while to find the problem, so I'm posting in case someone
else runs in to this.

$sr = ldap_search($ds, "cn=me", "(objectclass=*)");
$entry = ldap_first_entry($ds, $sr);
do {
  // do other stuff
  $sr = "something else now";
  $values = ldap_get_values($ds, $entry, "attirib1");
  // do other stuff
} while ($entry = ldap_next_entry($ds, $entry));

If you change the search resource $sr to something else even though it's not
used again it will kill the page it'll be a blank page and if you view the code
you'll get different things depending on something no idea what.

This kepted happening I had forgotten I had used $sr so I was using it again
and it would just not show the page whenever I used ldap_get_values, if this is
a feature it would be nice to know. I haven't seen it happen with other
functions.

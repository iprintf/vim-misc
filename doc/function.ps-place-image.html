ps_place_image — Places image on the page

说明

bool ps_place_image ( resource $psdoc , int $imageid , float $x , float $y , 
float $scale )

Places a formerly loaded image on the page. The image can be scaled. If the
image shall be rotated as well, you will have to rotate the coordinate system
before with ps_rotate().

参数

psdoc

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by ps_new().

imageid

    The resource identifier of the image as returned by ps_open_image() or 
    ps_open_image_file().

x

    x-coordinate of the lower left corner of the image.

y

    y-coordinate of the lower left corner of the image.

scale

    The scaling factor for the image. A scale of 1.0 will result in a
    resolution of 72 dpi, because each pixel is equivalent to 1 point.

To get png images to work I had to save them as indexed colour (128 colours).

If you want to make a template with graphics software and place it on your
PostScript page, one way to do it is with an eps file.

<?php
$template = ps_open_image_file($ps, 'eps', 'template.eps');
ps_place_image($ps, $template, 0, 0, 1);
?>

Professional page layout software such as InDesign will typically be able to
generate an eps file.  If your software can't, one way to do it (on Windows) is
to set up a printer that prints to file with the driver "Lexmark Color 4079
plus PS".  This driver is included with Windows and has the option in its
advanced preferences to generate an EPS file.

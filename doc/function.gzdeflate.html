gzdeflate — Deflate a string

说明

string gzdeflate ( string $data [, int $level = -1 [, int $encoding =
ZLIB_ENCODING_RAW ]] )

This function compresses the given string using the DEFLATE data format.

For details on the DEFLATE compression algorithm see the document "» DEFLATE
Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3" (RFC 1951).

参数

data

    The data to deflate.

level

    The level of compression. Can be given as 0 for no compression up to 9 for
    maximum compression. If not given, the default compression level will be
    the default compression level of the zlib library.

encoding

    One of ZLIB_ENCODING_* constants.

返回值

The deflated string or FALSE if an error occurred.

范例

Example #1 gzdeflate() example

<?php
$compressed = gzdeflate('Compress me', 9);
echo $compressed;
?>

更新日志

版本            说明
5.4.0 Added encoding parameter.

===============================================================================

Take care that that "PHP deflate" != "HTTP deflate".

The deflate encoding used in HTTP is actually zlib encoded.

This is what PHP functions return:
gzencode() == gzip
gzcompress() == zlib (aka. HTTP deflate)
gzdeflate()  == *raw* deflate encoding
===============================================================================

running 50000 repetitions on various content, i found that gzdeflate() and
gzcompress() both performed equally fast regardless content and compression
level, but gzinflate() was always about twice as fast as gzuncompress().
===============================================================================

gzcompress produces longer data because it embeds information about the
encoding onto the string. If you are compressing data that will only ever be
handled on one machine, then you don't need to worry about which of these
functions you use. However, if you are passing data compressed with these
functions to a different machine you should use gzcompress.
===============================================================================

The HTTP deflate is quite complicated.
The RFC7230, Sec 4.2.2 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.2.2)
says:
«The "deflate" coding is a "zlib" data format [RFC1950] containing a "deflate"
compressed data stream [RFC1951] that uses a combination of the Lempel-Ziv
(LZ77) compression algorithm and Huffman coding.»
and, also:
«Note: Some non-conformant implementations send the "deflate" compressed data
without the zlib wrapper.»

Since this function implements the RFC1951, the compliant encoding of a
$payload should be:

gzcompress(gzdeflate($payload));
===============================================================================

After some searching and experimentation I found that the output from this
function cannot be 'inflated' with the objective c 'zlibInflate' wrapper for
'zlib' that is available at http://cocoadev.com/wiki/NSDataCategory but the
output from gzcompress() can be. Thank you "anonymous at php dot net" and
"tomas at slax dot org" for the clues. I hope this saves someone else the
searching.
===============================================================================

start from php5.4.0 gzdeflate has the fastest speed and best zip rate.
http://3v4l.org/K2XAf
===============================================================================

gzcompress() is the same like gzdefflate(), it produces identical data and its
speed is the same as well. The only difference is that gzcompress produces 6
bytes bigger result (2 extra bytes at the beginning and 4 extra bytes at the
end).
===============================================================================

The "One of ZLIB_ENCODING_* constants." seems to be available only from PHP
5.4.

So I guess that is you are PHP 5.3 you don't use the $encoding parameter...
===============================================================================

if you have compressed data which is greater than 2 MB (system dependent), you
will receive a buffer error by calling the function gzinflate().
be sure to to compress your data by a lower compression level, like 1.
i.e.: gzdeflate($sData, 1);

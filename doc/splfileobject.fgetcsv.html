SplFileObject::fgetcsv — Gets line from file and parse as CSV fields

说明

public array SplFileObject::fgetcsv ([ string $delimiter = "," [, string
$enclosure = "\"" [, string $escape = "\\" ]]] )

Gets a line from the file which is in CSV format and returns an array
containing the fields read.

参数

delimiter

    The field delimiter (one character only). Defaults as a comma or the value
    set using SplFileObject::setCsvControl().

enclosure

    The field enclosure character (one character only). Defaults as a double
    quotation mark or the value set using SplFileObject::setCsvControl().

escape

    The escape character (one character only). Defaults as a backslash (\) or
    the value set using SplFileObject::setCsvControl().

返回值

Returns an indexed array containing the fields read, or FALSE on error.

    Note:

    A blank line in a CSV file will be returned as an array comprising a single
    NULL field unless using SplFileObject::SKIP_EMPTY |
    SplFileObject::DROP_NEW_LINE, in which case empty lines are skipped.

范例

Example #1 SplFileObject::fgetcsv() example

<?php
$file = new SplFileObject("data.csv");
while (!$file->eof()) {
    var_dump($file->fgetcsv());
}
?>

Example #2 SplFileObject::READ_CSV example

<?php
$file = new SplFileObject("animals.csv");
$file->setFlags(SplFileObject::READ_CSV);
foreach ($file as $row) {
    list($animal, $class, $legs) = $row;
    printf("A %s is a %s with %d legs\n", $animal, $class, $legs);
}
?>

Contents of animals.csv

crocodile,reptile,4
dolphin,mammal,0
duck,bird,2
koala,mammal,4
salmon,fish,0

以上例程的输出类似于：

A crocodile is a reptile with 4 legs
A dolphin is a mammal with 0 legs
A duck is a bird with 2 legs
A koala is a mammal with 4 legs
A salmon is a fish with 0 legs

===============================================================================

Note that due to bugs 55807 and 61032, introduced in 5.3.8, if the csv in
example #2 has a newline character at the end of each line, the foreach will
execute 6 times.

The last time through the loop $row will be bool(false). This is true even if
using SplFileObject::SKIP_EMPTY and SplFileObject::DROP_NEW_LINE.

Until the bug is fixed, the workaround is to also add SplFileObject::READ_AHEAD
to your setFlags() call.
===============================================================================

after setting the delimiter '\t' fgetcsv() truncates the value when it is empty
string

workaround:

<?php
$file = new SplFileObject($path);
$file->setFlags(SplFileObject::DROP_NEW_LINE);
while ($file->valid()) {
    $line = $file->fgets();
    $line = explode("\t", $line);

    print_r($line);
}
?>

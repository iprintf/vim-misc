MongoCursor::dead

(PECL mongo >=0.9.6)

MongoCursor::dead — Checks if there are results that have not yet been sent
from the database

说明

public bool MongoCursor::dead ( void )

The database sends responses in batches of documents, up to 4MB of documents
per response. This method checks if the database has more batches or if the
result set has been exhausted.

A cursor being "dead" does not mean that MongoCursor::hasNext() will return
FALSE, it only means that the database is done sending results to the client.
The client should continue iterating through results until MongoCursor::hasNext
() is FALSE.

参数

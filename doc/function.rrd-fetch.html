For example, this worked for me:

<?php
$result = rrd_fetch( "mydata.rrd", array( "AVERAGE", "--resolution", "60", 
"--start", "-1d", "--end", "start+1h" ) );
?>

This will fetch all fields.  You then have to use something like this to get to
a specified rrd field:

<?php
foreach ( $result["data"]["myfield"] as $key => $value )
{
    echo "At timestamp $key, the value for myfield is $value.\n";
}
?>

A few years ago, the extension was patched so that it would count options
itself. But for me, it's buggy (it does not work with more than 3 arguments)
and neither does work.

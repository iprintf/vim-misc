Phar::createDefaultStub — Create a phar-file format specific stub

说明

final public static string Phar::createDefaultStub ([ string $indexfile [, 
string $webindexfile ]] )

This method is intended for creation of phar-file format-specific stubs, and is
not intended for use with tar- or zip-based phar archives.

Phar archives contain a bootstrap loader, or stub written in PHP that is
executed when the archive is executed in PHP either via include:
<?php
include 'myphar.phar';
?>
or by simple execution:

php myphar.phar


This method provides a simple and easy method to create a stub that will run a
startup file from the phar archive. In addition, different files can be
specified for running the phar archive from the command line versus through a
web server. The loader stub also calls Phar::interceptFileFuncs() to allow easy
bundling of a PHP application that accesses the file system. If the phar
extension is not present, the loader stub will extract the phar archive to a
temporary directory and then operate on the files. A shutdown function erases
the temporary files on exit.

返回值

Returns a string containing the contents of a customized bootstrap loader
(stub) that allows the created Phar archive to work with or without the Phar
extension enabled.

错误／异常

Throws UnexpectedValueException if either parameter is longer than 400 bytes.

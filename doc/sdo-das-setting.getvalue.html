此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Returns the old value for the changed property. This can be used by a Data
Access Service when writing updates to a data source. The DAS uses the old
value to detect conflicts by comparing it with the current value in the data
source. If they do not match, then the data source has been updated since the
data object was originally populated, and therefore writing any new updates
risks compromising the integrity of the data.

参数

None.

返回值

Returns the old value of the changed property.

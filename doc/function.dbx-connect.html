(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6, PHP 5 <= 5.0.5, PECL dbx >= 1.1.0)

dbx_connect — Open a connection/database

说明

object dbx_connect ( mixed $module , string $host , string $database , string
$username , string $password [, int $persistent ] )

Opens a connection to a database.

参数

module

    The module parameter can be either a string or a constant, though the
    latter form is preferred. The possible values are given below, but keep in
    mind that they only work if the module is actually loaded.

      □ DBX_MYSQL or "mysql"
      □ DBX_ODBC or "odbc"
      □ DBX_PGSQL or "pgsql"
      □ DBX_MSSQL or "mssql"
      □ DBX_FBSQL or "fbsql"
      □ DBX_SYBASECT or "sybase_ct"
      □ DBX_OCI8 or "oci8"
      □ DBX_SQLITE or "sqlite"

host

    The SQL server host

database

    The database name

username

    The username

password

    The password

persistent

    The persistent parameter can be set to DBX_PERSISTENT, if so, a persistent
    connection will be created.

The host, database, username and password parameters are expected, but not
always used depending on the connect functions for the abstracted module.

返回值

Returns an object on success, FALSE on error. If a connection has been made but
the database could not be selected, the connection is closed and FALSE is
returned.

The returned object has three properties:

database
    It is the name of the currently selected database.
handle

    It is a valid handle for the connected database, and as such it can be used
    in module-specific functions (if required).
    <?php
    $link = dbx_connect(DBX_MYSQL, "localhost", "db", "username", "password");
    mysql_close($link->handle); // dbx_close($link) would be better here
    ?>

module
    It is used internally by dbx only, and is actually the module number
    mentioned above.

If you get an error:
"Error while trying to retrieve text for error ORA-12154"
means that you didn't set the ORACLE_HOME, TNS_ADMIN and ORACLE_BASE variable.
If you are sure it's set as a system variable, you could solve the problem by
use:
putenv('ORACLE_HOME=/your/oracle/home/beforebin');

I have been using dbx for a product at work and the need to use SQLite as a
database popped up. However, I couldn't find any references to using it with
dbx other than that you could and since SQLite doesn't seem to do the username
password thing I was a little confused as to how to use it in dbx.

With a little research it seems that when using dbx_connect you only need to
fill in the module name ('DBX_SQLITE') and the database (the file name for the
database!) to get it working. e.g.

$link = dbx_connect(DBX_SQLITE, "", "some.db", "", "");

thought someone might find it useful, especially since it no longer required
additional dll's in version 5.x
===============================================================================

The advantage that this has over Pear, Adob, and even Eclipse is speed. As some
one put elsewhere,

"Yes, there is an advantage: Speed!
ext/dbx is written in C and has to be compiled into PHP. It's just faster then
the PEAR classes."

Currently to connect to the PostgreSQL backend, you have to supply both a
username, and a password or the dbx pgsql module attempts to connect as
"nobody".
===============================================================================

Pear::DB seems like a better idea than this.  See http://pear.php.net

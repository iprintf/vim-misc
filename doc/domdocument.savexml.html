DOMDocument::saveXML — Dumps the internal XML tree back into a string

说明

public string DOMDocument::saveXML ([ DOMNode $node [, int $options ]] )

Creates an XML document from the DOM representation. This function is usually
called after building a new dom document from scratch as in the example below.

参数

node

    Use this parameter to output only a specific node without XML declaration
    rather than the entire document.

options

    Additional Options. Currently only LIBXML_NOEMPTYTAG is supported.

返回值

Returns the XML, or FALSE if an error occurred.

错误／异常

DOM_WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

    Raised if node is from another document.

更新日志

版本             说明
5.1.0 Added the options parameter

范例

Example #1 Saving a DOM tree into a string

<?php

$doc = new DOMDocument('1.0');
// we want a nice output
$doc->formatOutput = true;

$root = $doc->createElement('book');
$root = $doc->appendChild($root);

$title = $doc->createElement('title');
$title = $root->appendChild($title);

$text = $doc->createTextNode('This is the title');
$text = $title->appendChild($text);

echo "Saving all the document:\n";
echo $doc->saveXML() . "\n";

echo "Saving only the title part:\n";
echo $doc->saveXML($title);

?>

以上例程会输出：

Saving all the document:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<book>
  <title>This is the title</title>
</book>

Saving only the title part:
<title>This is the title</title>

if you are storing multi-byte characters in XML, then saving the XML using
saveXML() will create problems. It will spit out the characters converted in
encoded format.

<?php
$str = domdoc->saveXML(); // gives "&x#1245;" some encoded data
?>

Instead do the following

<?php
$str = domdoc->saveXML(domdoc->documentElement); // gives "保存しました"
correct multi-byte data
?>
===============================================================================

If you want to save xhtml (in a string), you may try the following method:
<?php
    $doc = new DOMDocument('1.0');

    // ...

    $xhtml = (string) $doc->saveXML($doc->doctype);
    $xhtml .= "\n";
    $xhtml .= (string) $doc->saveXML($doc->documentElement);
?>

It took some searching to figure this one out. I didn't see much in the way of
explaining this glitch in the manual thus far. (For PHP5 I believe)

formatOutput = true; appears to fail when the origin of the DOM came from a
file via load(). EX:

<?php
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->load ("test.xml");
    $dom->formatOutput = true;

    $new_tag = $dom->createElement ('testNode');
    $new_tag->appendChild (
        $dom->createElement ('test', 'this is a test'));
    $dom->documentElement->appendChild ($new_tag);

    printf ("<pre>%s</pre>", htmlentities ($dom->saveXML()));
?>

Will not indent the output and will display the modified nodes all in one long
line. Makes for editing a config.xml a bit difficult when saving to a file.

By adding the preserveWhiteSpace = false; BEFORE the load() the formatOutput
works as expected. EX:

<?php
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->preserveWhiteSpace = false;
    $dom->load ("test.xml");
    $dom->formatOutput = true;

    $new_tag = $dom->createElement ('testNode');
    $new_tag->appendChild (
        $dom->createElement ('test', 'this is a test'));
    $dom->documentElement->appendChild ($new_tag);

    printf ("<pre>%s</pre>", htmlentities ($dom->saveXML()));
?>

CAUTION: If your loaded xml file (test.xml) has an empty root node that is not
shortened or has no children this will NOT work.

Example:

DOES NOT WORK:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
</root>

WORKS:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root/>

WORKS:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <!-- comment -->
</root>

WORKS:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <child/>
</root>
===============================================================================

When you save whole document:
DOMDocument->saveXML() produces string in encoding defined in property
DOMDocument->encoding.

When you save only one node:
DOMDocument->saveXML(DOMNode) produces always string in UTF-8.
===============================================================================

As @fbernodi said earlier, there is a problem with saveXML of DOMNode when you
have a number of defined namespaces. The simple solution for this:

<code>
   // $node is some node of some other document
   $temp_document = new DOMDocument('1.0', 'utf-8');
   $temp_document->appendChild($temp_document->importNode($node, true));
   echo $temp_document->saveXML();
</code>

We discovered using DOMDocument::saveHTML() that it converts to HTML 4.01
compatible markup; rather than XHTML. The simple answer is to use saveXML()
instead, although this adds the XML declaration to the top.

To qjerry.com at gmail.com, thanks for the pointer below - but I think that the
simplest way seems to be using:
<?php $domDocument->saveXML($domDocument->documentElement); ?>

Of course, if you're dealing with XHTML, this will strip any <!DOCTYPE>
declarations in the document too.

Comment to `devin at SPAMISBAD dot tritarget dot com''s post:

Thanks for pointing out the pitfalls of `formatOutput' vs. `load*()'. This has
certainly saved me from some possible surprises.

I think the seemingly strange behaviour can be explained. Warning: The
following stuff is mostly based on deductions and experiments. Much less on
studying the sources and specs (I'm not sure some of these would provide answer
anyway, at least not easily).

As you point out, `preserveWhiteSpace' must be set before loading the DOM from
the source string (I'm working with `loadXML()' but I believe the situation
should be the same with `load()' you used). This looks logical, as this
property seems to control the parsing and DOM creation process during which
text nodes containing the whitespace are either included or dropped. This can
be proven by dumping the DOM structure and comparing the results based on the
value of `preserveWhiteSpace'. With `preserveWhiteSpace' set to `FALSE', no
text nodes containing whitespace will be present in the returned DOM. When this
property is `TRUE', these nodes will be present.

Note: When speaking about the whitespace in the previous paragraph, we're most
certainly speaking about so called `whitespace in element content' or `element
content whitespace', if I'm not mistaken. See also my comment in the notes of
`DOMText->isWhitespaceInElementContent()' method.

As for the mysterious effect on the output of `saveXLM()', I think the
explanation lies in the presence or absence of the above mentioned whitespace
text nodes. This was also proven by experiments: After adding such a node into
a DOM which contained none (the DOM was created using `loadXML()' with
`preserveWhiteSpace' set to `FALSE'), the output formatting got affected in a
such a way, the formatting got lost for the rest of the document after the
added node. I think the presence of whitespace text nodes forces such
rendering, that the content of these nodes is used to separate adjoining nodes
thus disabling default formatting. Only when there are no such text nodes
present, the ouput formatting takes effect (provided the `formatOutput' is set
to `TRUE', of course).

Well, the thing I don't really understand is how you did get an output of a
signle line with `formatOutput' set to `TRUE'. This has happened to me when no
whitespace text nodes were present (ie. when loading the XML with
`preserveWhiteSpace' set to `FALSE') *and* with `formatOutput' set to *`FALSE'*
(with the opposite value of `formatOutput', the formatting should do it's work
and you should not end up with just one line). But I haven't seen your source.
Perhaps you had whitespace nodes containing no new-lines in your DOM?

As for the CAUTION about root element, I didn't see any problems with empty
root element neither in shortened nor full form. What did you have in mind,
when you said it `WORKS' or `DOES NOT WORK'?
===============================================================================

Be careful, this function has been changed in 5.2.6 version. Adding a required
parameter which is not that required wasn't the most intelligent idea ever,
especially for a function which is often used.

To fix your programs if you have an error, fill the first parameter like this:

$dom->saveXML($dom->documentElement);

Why didn't the devs simply implement this as optional parameter, fixing the
default parameter as documentElement?

Quick tip to minimize memory when generating documents with DOM.

Rather than using
   $xmlStr = DOMDocument->saveXML();
   echo $xmlStr;

to dump a large DOM to the output buffer, use a PHP output stream, as in

   DOMDocument->save('php://output');

A lot of memory will be saved when generating large DOMs.

Hello,

I had an unexpected behavior in some parsing code, because of this saveXML
method that is saving the tags without namespace specification. If you try to
load into a DOMDocument a string saved from a DOMNode that has a referenced
namespace but it the original document it was not defined in that element, you
get a not well formed xml. In the example you can see the issue and a possible
solution, the other solution may be add to the ChildElement node the namespace
reference (<testNS:ChildElement testNS="http://example.org">), but in my
scenario it was not needed.

<?php

//Test XML
$test_xml =
"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>
<testNS:RootNode xmlns:testNS=\"http://example.org\">
    <testNS:ChildElement>
        <testNS:AnotherChildElement>I'm a Another Child node.</
testNS:AnotherChildElement>
    </testNS:ChildElement>
</testNS:RootNode>";

//We define our Test DOMDocument
$domDoc = new DOMDocument("1.0");
$domDoc->loadXML($test_xml);

//We use xpath to search ChildElement:
$domXPath = new DOMXPath($domDoc);
$domXPath->registerNamespace("testNS", "http://example.org");
$DOMNodeList_ChildElement = $domXPath->query("//testNS:RootNode/
testNS:ChildElement");
$ChildElement = $DOMNodeList_ChildElement->item(0);

echo "Not usefull xml to load in another document:\n\n";
echo $domDoc->saveXML($ChildElement);

/* Output here:
*
* Not usefull xml to load in another document:
*
*  <testNS:ChildElement>
*        <testNS:AnotherChildElement>I'm a Another Child node.</
testNS:AnotherChildElement>
*    </testNS:ChildElement>
*
*/

/**

* @param DOMElement $node The node to clone.
* @param DOMDocument $doc The document where we are going to reference the

* @return DOMElement The new cloned element without namespace.
*/
function cloneNode($node, $doc) {
    //Create new element with the original localName (w/o namespace)
    $nd = $doc->createElement($node->localName);

    //Clone attributes
    foreach($node->attributes as $value)
        $nd->setAttribute($value->localName, $value->value);

    //No more childs then we finish.
    if (!$node->childNodes)
        return $nd;
    //We have childs, add them
    foreach($node->childNodes as $child) {
        if ($child->nodeName=="#text") //Only needed to clone text nodes, i.e.
text comments, spaces, tabs. etc.
            $nd->appendChild($doc->createTextNode($child->nodeValue));
        else
            $nd->appendChild(cloneNode($child, $doc)); //recursion to clone all
children.
    }
    return $nd;
}

//New Document to reference the new node without namespaces
$domDoc2 = new DOMDocument("1.0");

//We clone this node taking out the namespace
$new_node = cloneNode($ChildElement, $domDoc2);

echo "\n\nWe can load this into a DOMDocument without problems:\n\n";
echo $domDoc2->saveXML($new_node);

/*
* We can load this into a DOMDocument without problems:
*
*    <ChildElement>
*        <AnotherChildElement>I'm a Another Child node.</AnotherChildElement>
*    </ChildElement>
*/

===============================================================================

The simpliest (and probably the fastest) way to strip an XML declaration (<?xml
version="1.0" ... ?>) out of output document, is to output child nodes of
DOMDocument separately:

<?php

$document = new DOMDocument();
$document->load('/some/file.xml');

// this will also output doctype and comments at top level
foreach($document->childNodes as $node)
    $result .= $document->saveXML($node)."\n";

echo $result;

?>

This might be userful when dealing with browser compatibility issues, for
example, well known problem with valid XHTML in IE6.
===============================================================================

Create before test.xml with:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Photos>
</Photos>

and past after in your php-file:

<?php
$simp = simplexml_load_file('test.xml');
$node = $simp->addChild('home');
$node->addChild('mychild', 'insert text');
$s = simplexml_import_dom($simp);
$s->saveXML('test.xml');
?>

This code creating a child-nod in the root.

Note that for large DOM trees (tens of thousands of elements nested at least a
few levels deep), setting formatOutput to true drives up memory usage to rather
insane levels when you call saveXML(). (Tested with PHP 5.2.1) Pretty output is
not worth that cost.
===============================================================================

A little function to get the full xml contents of a Xml node.

function innerXml($node)
{
    $out = $node->ownerDocument->saveXML($node);
    $re = "{^<(\\w*)(?:\\s*\\w+=(?:\"[^\"]*\"|\'[^\']*\'))*\\s*>(.*)</\\1>$}";
    preg_match($re, $out, $mat);
    return $mat[2];
}
===============================================================================

I used the function posted by "joe" but the following works to me for get the
innerXML
<?php
$itemLeido = $XMLRespuesta->getElementsByTagName("articulos");
foreach($itemLeido as $node) {
    echo($node->ownerDocument->saveXML($node));
}
?>

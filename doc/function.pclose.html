pclose

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pclose — 关闭进程文件指针

说明

int pclose ( resource $handle )

关闭用 popen() 打开的指向管道的文件指针。

参数

handle

    文件指针必须有效，且必须是成功调用 popen() 所返回的。

返回值

返回运行的进程的终止状态。发生错误时会返回 -1。

范例

Example #1 pclose() 例子

<?php
$handle = popen('/bin/ls', 'r');
pclose($handle);
?>

注释

    Note: Unix Only:

    proc_close() is internally implemented using the waitpid(3) system call. To
    obtain the real exit status code the pcntl_wexitstatus() function should be
    used.

===============================================================================

As I understand pclose will return 0 (on every platform) in case popen could
not execute the specified command.

Since popen only returns the status wether it was able to send a command and
not wether it was succesfully executed. Only the returned value of pclose can
be used to check wether a command could be executed.
===============================================================================

Regarding the return value:
"Returns the termination status of the process that was run. In case of an
error then -1 is returned. "
and the note about the exit status: "pclose() is internally implemented using
the waitpid(3) system call. To obtain the real exit status code the
pcntl_wexitstatus() function should be used."

The documentation of the return value is, at best, misleading. The function
returns, as does proc_close():
* -1 on error,
* WEXITSTATUS(status) if WIFEXITED(status) is true, or
* status if WIFEXITED(status) is false,
where status is the status parameter of waitpid().

This makes it impossible to differentiate between a relatively normal exit or a
termination by signal, and reduces the value of the proc_close return code to a
binary one (ok / something broke).

This can be seen in proc_open_rsrc_dtor() in ext/standard/proc_open.c (PHP
5.4.44, 5.6.12).

The note advising the use of pcntl_wexitstatus is plain wrong. One cannot use
pcntl_wexitstatus because it already has been used.
===============================================================================

The termination status, as pointed out in another note, is not the same as the
exit status from the process. However, something like "pclose($fp)/256" is not
the correct way to extract the exit status, since this uses system- and
version-specific knowledge of where in the termination status the exit status
is stored. (Also, the process may not even have exited normally, so it may not
have an exit status at all.)

Instead, the functions pcntl_wifexited() and pcntl_wexitstatus() should be
used. They are wrappers for the C macros WIFEXITED() and WEXITSTATUS() that are
designed for determining whether the process had an exit status and what that
status was, respectively.
===============================================================================

Somewhere between 4.1.1 and 4.2.3, the return value from pclose changed.

The exit status used to be in the second byte, so that the status would be
(pclose($fp)/256).

It is now in the low-order byte, so the status is just pclose($fp).

Be careful.

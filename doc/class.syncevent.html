The SyncEvent class

(PECL sync >= Unknown)

简介

A cross-platform, native implementation of named and unnamed event objects.
Both automatic and manual event objects are supported.

An event object waits, without polling, for the object to be fired/set. One
instance waits on the event object while another instance fires/sets the event.
Event objects are useful wherever a long-running process would otherwise poll a
resource (e.g. checking to see if uploaded data needs to be processed).

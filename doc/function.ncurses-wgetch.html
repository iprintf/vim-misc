Something worth noting here; I noticed that with ncurses_wgetch function keys
are broken into multiple codes while ncurses_getch returns only one attributed
code.

For example, with ncurses_wgetch pressing an up arrow results in three codes 27
91 65 (an ascii escape sequence). The problem is subsequent calls to
ncurses_wgetch are required to acquire all three codes. Unfortunately, pressing
an “A” key for example would result in only a single code of 65. This makes it
hard to trap for both function keys and regular keys.

However, with ncurses_getch an up arrow results in a single attributed code of
259 or the “NCURSES_KEY_UP” key constant. An “A” key is still 65.
===============================================================================

By default ncurses_wgetch does not return keypad keys.  If you need to use
function or arrow keys in a sub window, simply do this first.

ncurses_keypad($win, TRUE);
===============================================================================

Heres a function to get a string from a specific window and return it on ENTER.

// Dynamic String Input (converts INT ASCII to CHAR)
function ncurses_wgetstr($win){
    $strlen = 1;
    for ($sx=0;$sx<$strlen;$sx++){
        $strlen++;
        $ch = ncurses_wgetch($win);
        if ($ch == 13){
            return $str;
            break 2;
        }
        $str .= chr($ch);
    }
}

Example:

$ncurse = ncurses_init();
$fullscreen = ncurses_newwin (0,0,  0,0);
ncurses_border(0,0,  0,0,  0,0,  0,0);
ncurses_refresh();

while (1){
    $keyPressed = ncurses_wgetstr($fullscreen);
    ncurses_wrefresh($fullscreen);
}

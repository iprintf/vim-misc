(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoCursor::maxTimeMS — Sets a server-side timeout for this query

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::maxTimeMS ( int $ms )

Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds to be allowed by the server
for processing operations on the cursor.

参数

ms

    Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds to be allowed by the
    server for processing operations on the cursor.

返回值

This cursor.

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if this cursor has started iterating.

Causes methods that fetch results to throw a MongoExecutionTimeoutException if
the query takes longer than the specified number of milliseconds in processing
time.

范例

Example #1 MongoCursor::maxTimeMS() example

In the following example, the server will abort the query if the cursor
requires more than two seconds in processing time to return its results.

<?php

$cursor = $collection->find();
$cursor->maxTimeMS(2000);

try {
    $results = iterator_to_array($cursor);
} catch (MongoExecutionTimeoutException $e) {
    echo "query took too long!";
}

?>

注释

Warning

Unlike MongoCursor::timeout(), which specifies a client-side timeout, 
MongoCursor::maxTimeMS() can be used to cause the MongoDB server to abort
long-running queries. This timeout is cumulative for the lifetime of the cursor
(i.e. each batch will contribute to this time limit). The timeout only
considers processing time; idle time is not considered.

rpm_is_valid — Tests a filename for validity as an RPM file

说明

bool rpm_is_valid ( string $filename )

rpm_is_valid() will test an RPM file for validity as an RPM file. This is not
the same as rpm_open() as it only checks the file for validity but does not
return a file pointer to be used by further functions.

参数

filename

    The filename of the RPM file you wish to check for validity.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 rpm_is_valid() example

<?php

$file = "/path/to/file.rpm";

if (rpm_is_valid($file)) {
    echo "File is recognized as an RPM file.<br>\n";
}
else {
    echo "File is not recognized as an RPM file.<br>\n";
}

?>

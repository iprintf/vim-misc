rawurlencode

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

rawurlencode — 按照 RFC 3986 对 URL 进行编码

说明

string rawurlencode ( string $str )

根据 » RFC 3986 编码指定的字符。

参数

str

    要编码的 URL。

返回值

返回字符串，此字符串中除了 -_. 之外的所有非字母数字字符都将被替换成百分号（%）
后跟两位十六进制数。这是在 » RFC 3986 中描述的编码，是为了保护原义字符以免其被
解释为特殊的 URL 定界符，同时保护 URL 格式以免其被传输媒体（像一些邮件系统）使
用字符转换时弄乱。


    Note:

    在 PHP 5.3.0 之前，rawurlencode 根据 » RFC 1738 来编码波浪线（~）。

更新日志

版本                               说明
5.3.4 因为 rawurlencode() 使用了 EBCDIC，所以波浪线字符不会再被编码。
5.3.0 现在符合了» RFC 3986。

范例

Example #1 在 FTP URL 里包含一个密码

<?php
echo '<a href="ftp://user:', rawurlencode('foo @+%/'),
     '@ftp.example.com/x.txt">';
?>

以上例程会输出：

<a href="ftp://user:foo%20%40%2B%25%2F@ftp.example.com/x.txt">

或者，如果你想通过 URL 的 PATH_INFO 构成部分去传递信息：

Example #2 rawurlencode() 示例 2

<?php
echo '<a href="http://example.com/department_list_script/',
    rawurlencode('sales and marketing/Miami'), '">';
?>

以上例程会输出：

<a href="http://example.com/department_list_script/sales%20and%20marketing%2FMiami">

===============================================================================

I've written a simple function to convert an UTF-8 string to URL encoded
string. All the given characters are converted!

The function:
<?php
function mb_rawurlencode($url){
$encoded='';
$length=mb_strlen($url);
for($i=0;$i<$length;$i++){
$encoded.='%'.wordwrap(bin2hex(mb_substr($url,$i,1)),2,'%',true);
}
return $encoded;
}
?>

Example:
<?php
echo 'http://example.com/',
    mb_rawurlencode('你好');
?>

The above example will output:
http://example.com/%e4%bd%a0%e5%a5%bd
===============================================================================

Note that RFC 1738 has been amended:
The "[" and "]" are no longer considered unsafe, but instead are now considered
"reserved", meaning that they CAN be used in URLs!

Currently this usage has only been allowed in the hostname part, but there are
some proposals to allow such use in some URL schemes. Similar extensions are
now found that use the "{}" characters as "reserved" characters with special
semantics, instead of "unsafe" characters that must be URL encoded...

Note also that some characters are currently "reserved" but should have instead
been considered as "unsafe": this includes the parenthesis "()" which are
clearly unsafe when a URL is used in MIME headers.

Because of this, if a valid URL contains "()" characters, one should use an
upper-level encoding to either enclose the URL with a pair of "unsafe"
characters defined in the upper-level protocol (for example a "<>" pair in MIME
headers, because these characters cannot be part of a valid URL)...
===============================================================================

You can encode paths using:

<?php
$encoded = implode("/", array_map("rawurlencode", explode("/", $path)));
?>
===============================================================================

--- 1) About "reserved" characters in URLS:

Beware that RFC 1738 specifies that the characters "{", "}", "|", "\", "^",
"~", "[", "]", and "`" are all considered unsafe and SHOULD be URL-encoded with
a "%xx" triplet within *ALL* URLs.

However, some HTTP URLs seem to use the "~" character as a prefix for a user
account for example:
http://www.any.host.domain/~user/subpath/page.html?query#fragment

This usage is acceptable, but the RFC specifies that "%7E" should be used
instead of "~" in the path component. HTTP servers should accept "~" as being
equivalent to "%7E", and according to the RFC, the "%7E" form should be the
canonical one.

However, some HTTP servers are not fully complying to this RFC and consider
"%7E" differently from "~" (i.e. they consider it as being part of a path
component name, and search a directory name containing a "~" character, instead
of mapping the "~user" path component to a user's directory. In that case,
these non compliant HTTP server will not find the resource associated to that
URL and may return a 404 error or other errors such as an access denied.

When using rawurlencode() on such HTTP URLs, it's best to consider this legacy
usage, by using str_replace() on the result to convert back "/%7E" to "/~", so
that the URLs will correctly map to the legacy use of the "~" character by
these servers. On compliant HTTP servers, they will treat the "~" unsafe
character equivalently with the "%7E" recommanded form, so they will
automatically canonicalize the "~" character into "%7E".

--- 2) Encoding of hostnames in URLs

Finally, beware that host domain names parts in URLs *MUST NOT* be encoded with
rawurlencode(), as the "[" and "]" are valid delimiters that *MUST* be used to
reference an IPv6 address or other hostnames that don't fit to the restricted
set of characters allowed in a host name (the "[" and "]" characters MUST be
used if the hostname includes characters such as ":" which is typically used to
specify an alternate non-default port number).

The encoding of host names uses another encoding, required to encode
international domain names, with a base-64 encoding of Unicode characters and a
"bq--" prefix. This encoding must be used only on individual subdomain parts
(separated by "." characters). This encoding does not use any "%xx" triplets.

So NEVER use urlencode() or rawurlencode() on an unparsed URL, unless this full
URL is part of a query parameter string!

--- 3) Encoding of username/passwords in URLs:

There is no standard to specify a password in a URL. In fact, there's a legacy
usage of the ":" character to separate a username from a password, but it is
strongly discouraged. The RFC does not attempt to specify a semantic to the
authentication part of an URL (before the "@" character and the hostname part).

If you need to encode a password, always use rawurlencode() on username and
passwords separately, and then insert the ":" character to separate both
components. Don't use urlencode() (which could use a "+" to encode a space, and
would not work because usernames and passwords consider "+" and spaces as being
different!)
===============================================================================

phpversion()>=5.3 will compliant with RFC 3986, while phpversion()<=5.2.7RC1 is
not compliant with RFC 3986.

History of related RFCs:

RFC 1738 section 2.2
only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
unencoded within a URL.

RFC 2396 section 2.3
unreserved  = alphanum | mark
mark        = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"

RFC 2732 section 3
(3) Add "[" and "]" to the set of 'reserved' characters:

RFC 3986 section 2.3
unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

RFC 3987 section 2.2
unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
===============================================================================

rawurlencode() MUST not be used on unparsed URLs.

rawurlencode() should not be used on host and domain name parts (that may
include international characters encoded in each domain part with a "q--"
prefix followed by a special encoding of the international domain, currently in
testbed).

rawurlencode() may be used on usernames and passwords separately (so that it
won't encode the ':' and '@' separators).

rawurlencode() must not be used on paths (that may contain '/' separators): the
['path'] element of a parsed URL must first be exploded into individual
"directory" names. A directory or filename that contains a space must not be
encoded with urlencode() but with this rawurlencode(), so that it will appear
as a '%20' hex sequence (not '+')

rawurlencode() must not be used to encode the ['query'] element of a parsed
URL. Instead you must use the urlencode() function:

Typical queries often use the '&' separator between each parameter. This '&'
separator however is just a convention, used in the www-url-encoded format for
HTML forms using the default GET method. However, when references are done in a
HTML page to an URL that contains static query parameters, these '&' separators
should be encoded in the HTML code as '&amp;' for HTML conformance. This is not
part of the URL specification, but of the HTML encapsulation! Some browsers
forget this, and send '&amp;' with their HTTP GET query. You may wish to
substitute '&amp;' by '&' when parsing and validating URLs. This should be done
BEFORE calling urlencode() on query parts.

The ['fragment'] part of a parsed URL (after the first '#' separator found in
any URL) must not be encoded with this rawurlencode() function but instead by
urlencode().

Validating a URL sent in a HTTP request is then more complicated than what you
may think. This must be done only on parsed URLs (where the basic elements of
an URL have been splitted), and then you must explode the path components, and
check the presence of '&amp;' sequences in the query or fragment parts.

The next thing to do is to check the URL scheme that you want to support (for
example, only 'http', 'https', or 'ftp').

You may wich to check the ['port'] part to see if it's really a decimal integer
between 1 and 65535.
You may wish to remove the default port number used by the URL schemes you want
to support (for example the port '80' for 'http', the port '21' for 'ftp', the
port '443' for 'https'), and restrict severely all port numbers below 1024, or
some critical ports below 140 (this includes DNS and NetBios ports).

Then you may wish to control severely the ['host'] part (in fact a full host
domain name or an IP address), by forbidding those host names that don't
contain at least one dot, forbidding those that start with a dot, those that
contain two consecutive dots, those that start or finish with a '-' dash, those
that contain '.-' or '-.' (invalid in all domain names), those that contain two
dashes in another position than the second and third character of a domain name
part and not folled by at least one other character, forbid top level domain
names that have only one non numeric character, or more than 6 characters
(".museum" is, for now, the longest acceptable TLD), check that pseudo-TLD
names that are pure integers are effectively between 0 and 255, in that case
check that this is a valid IPv4 address by comparing it to long2ip(ip2long
($host)), ...

This done, you must use the urlencode() function on all parts up to the
exploded path elements, and rawurlencode() on the query and fragment parts,
according to the specs, to recreate a complete and validated URL.
===============================================================================

For those looking to strip all non-reserved characters from a URL according to
RFC 3986, the code would look like:

<?php
$stripped = preg_replace('/[^[:alnum:]-._~]/', '', $source);
?>

To get this string as it should be used in a url, you still probably want to
use rawurlencode, as the [:alpha:] posix bracket expression will catch accented
characters - use [A-Za-z][0-9] instead if you only want to include ascii
characters.

So a basic "slug" generation routine might look like:

<?php
function strtoslug($string) {
    // strip out all but unreserved characters from rfc:3986
    $stripped = preg_replace('/[^[:alnum:][:blank:]-._~]/', '', $string);
    // convert compacted whitespace to hyphens
    $slug = preg_replace('/[:blank:]+/', '-', $stripped);
    return $slug;
}
?>
===============================================================================

On the comments of rickyale and djmaze...
Is what you try to achieve is not a combination of utf8 and url encoding, e.g.
:

<?
$str = "bl f Charl ne";
$enc = urlencode(utf8_encode($str));
$str2 = utf8_decode(urldecode($enc));
echo "$str -> $enc -> $str2";
?>

will output:
bl f Charl ne -> bl%C3%B8f+Charl%C3%A8ne -> bl f Charl ne

At least works for me, Jeroen Hofstee
===============================================================================

Easier version to 'rickyale at ig dot com dot br' his example

<?php
function encode($text)
{
    $REQUEST_URI = str_replace('"', '%22', $text);
    // 0 - 128
    return preg_replace('#([\x3C\x3E])#e', '"%".bin2hex(\'\\1\')', $text);
}
?>
Just fill the regular expression with all characters that you need to have
encoded.

NOTE: 142 and up in his array are language specific ASCII characters so the
conversion to their unicode ('%C5%BD') equivelant may or may not work for you.
This needs a far more serious and bigger system to handle for non us tables
===============================================================================

If you, like me, sometimes have the misfortune of being forced to work with
PHP4, here is a PHP implementation of http_build_query() that produces more or
less the same output as this function, accepting the same arguments.

The only differences here are that the RFC selector argument does not behave
precisely correctly. This implementation passes RFC1738 through urlencode() and
RFC3986 through rawurlencode(), which is not 100% correct, see the manual pages
of those function for more information.

<?php

  if (!function_exists('http_build_query')) {

    if (!defined('PHP_QUERY_RFC1738')) define('PHP_QUERY_RFC1738', 1);
    if (!defined('PHP_QUERY_RFC3986')) define('PHP_QUERY_RFC3986', 2);

    function http_build_query ($query_data, $numeric_prefix = NULL, 
$arg_separator = NULL, $enc_type = PHP_QUERY_RFC1738, $base = NULL) {
      $result = array();
      $arg_separator = ($arg_separator != '') ? (string) $arg_separator : 
ini_get('arg_separator.output');
      $enc_func = ($enc_type == PHP_QUERY_RFC3986) ? 'rawurlencode' : 
'urlencode';
      foreach ($query_data as $key => $item) $result[] = (is_array($item) || 
is_object($item)) ? http_build_query($item, NULL, $arg_separator, $enc_type, (
$base !== NULL) ? "$base%5B".$enc_func($key).'%5D' : $enc_func($key)) : (($base
!== NULL) ? "$base%5B".$enc_func($key).'%5D='.$enc_func($item) : ((is_int($key)
&& $numeric_prefix !== NULL) ? (string) $numeric_prefix : '').$enc_func($key).'
='.$enc_func($item));
      return implode($arg_separator, $result);
    }

  }

I had serious trouble with local Windows paths containing umlauts on my Apache
2 / Windows NT machine. Apache could not find any of those files if I just used
rawurlencode. It's not noted anywhere here, but you fix this by simply making
your path utf8 first:

rawurlencode(utf8_encode($str));
===============================================================================

Note in regards to 'rickyale at ig dot com dot br' program:

Wouldn't the whole issue be fixed by using charset=utf-8 in the HTML page?

I'm passing some data between the HTML form and an PHP program - my 'special'
characters have to do with the Polish alphabet - and it looks like JavaScript
encoding actually... works.

Of course, I could have tested only a limitted number of cases.

Just a thought.
===============================================================================

In addition to my last post I would like to add that, this function is for the
"directories/somefile.ext" paths

In order to construct valid ftp url (with password added in it )
do this

$valid_path = "ftp://" . rawurlencode($user) . ":" . rawurlencode($pass) .
ftp_url_encode($your_server_path_to_file)

Last function will encode path url so that language characters remain untouched
and you get same file name for download after download dialog appears.
===============================================================================

The microsoft URLEncode method ignores the documentation in RFC1738 which
states that:

".... the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and reserved characters used for
their reserved purposes may be used unencoded within a URL"

So for example, myaddress@mydomain.com becomes myaddress%40mydomain%2Ecom,
whereas php and other languages would encode this as myaddress%40mydomain.com

This can be an issue when porting from asp or if you are doing string
comparison of strings urlencoded on different platforms.

NB. php will correctly decode myaddress%40mydomain%2Ecom to
myaddress@mydomain.com, it is only the encoding that differs
===============================================================================

PHP's functions rawurlencode() and urlencode(), both encode the whole argument
parameter string, making the result useless as a valid link.

The function listed here encodes a link string (e.g. http://www.domain.com/
long_path/to\file.php?query=param#fragm) to a valid <a href=""> parameter
string, preserving the original URI structure and the path given.

function linkencode ($p_url) {
    $ta = parse_url($p_url);
    if (!empty($ta[scheme])) { $ta[scheme].='://'; }
    if (!empty($ta[pass]) and !empty($ta[user])) {
            $ta[user].=':';
            $ta[pass]=rawurlencode($ta[pass]).'@';
    } elseif (!empty($ta[user])) {
        $ta[user].='@';
    }
    if (!empty($ta[port]) and !empty($ta[host])) {
        $ta[host]=''.$ta[host].':';
    } elseif    (!empty($ta[host])) {
        $ta[host]=$ta[host];
    }
    if (!empty($ta[path])) {
        $tu='';
        $tok=strtok($ta[path], "\\/");
        while (strlen($tok)) {
            $tu.=rawurlencode($tok).'/';
            $tok=strtok("\\/");
        }
        $ta[path]='/'.trim($tu, '/');
    }
    if (!empty($ta[query])) { $ta[query]='?'.$ta[query]; }
    if (!empty($ta[fragment])) { $ta[fragment]='#'.$ta[fragment]; }
    return implode('', array($ta[scheme], $ta[user], $ta[pass], $ta[host], $ta
[port], $ta[path], $ta[query], $ta[fragment]));
}
===============================================================================

I have to mention something about javier's post: the issue you are experiencing
only happens because you are using ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1) encoding,
which is an extension of ASCII using the values 128-255 for latin specific
characters (these characters are NOT part of ASCII). To say somethig like 0xF1
is the correct value for "ñ" in ASCII is wrong: any value equal or higher than
0x80 is invalid in ASCII; and there is no "correct" value for "ñ" in ASCII
because the ASCII character set does not include that character.
These encode/decode functions are designed to work on UTF-8, which is an
ASCII-compatible encoding for Unicode, thus being able to represent the entire
Unicode character range.

The main point is: the "Ã±" you get is the 0xC3 0xB1 sequence, interpreted as
two single-byte ISO-8859-1 characters; but if you interpret them as UTF-8, they
indeed represent "ñ". If you are working with the latin character set and
encoding, then you are fine with your method (which is essentially a utf-8 =>
iso-latin-1 converter).

For anybody who is using UTF-8 enconding, check if there is any issue before
you use a method like javier's: these multi-byte values are actually the right
way to represent any non-ASCII character on UTF-8.

For deeper details on the UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encodings, take a look at
wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-8859-1

(0xC0 | 0xB0), then, a logical AND between both LOW nibble (0x03 & 0x01), and
finally we have to make a logical OR between these two results -> [hex] ((0xC0
| 0xB0) | (0x03 & 0x01)) = [binary] ((1100 0000 | 1011 0000) | (0000 0011 &

As peter@nospam said, the microsoft uses an different table for encode string
when sending data...

with some test i have created a table with this encodes for special char like  
       

here is it for those who need know what is this table..

the index of array is the ord() of a character..
use with chr(index) to know the char.. and replace with the value.....

var    $ENCODE_TABLE = ARRAY(33=>'%21', 35=>'%23', 36=>'%24', 37=>'%25', 38=>

}

hope this help ...

Be careful here. rawurlencode changes ä to %C3%83%C2%A4 but firefox changes
this internally to %c3%83%c2%a4. This could lead to bugs with rewrite loops.
Cheers.
===============================================================================

This seems the correct way to encode ftp url which you could provide for your
users:

function ftp_url_encode($string) {

   $hex="";
   $retstr = "";
   for ($i=0; $i < strlen($string) ;$i++) {

     $char = $string[$i];
     if(($char >= '0' && $char <= '9') || ($char >= 'A' && $char <= 'Z') ||
($char >= 'a' && $char <= 'z') || $char == '.' || $char == '-' || $char == '/'
|| (ord($char) >=128) ) $retstr .= $char;
     else
     $retstr .= "%".strtoupper(dechex(ord($string[$i])));

   }
   return $retstr;
}

===============================================================================

note that if you implement your own server request engine in the HTTP manner
like:

GET $request_uri

you should first split all parts of the $request_uri path and rawurlencode()
each part, then concatenate those parts back again.  this function will
translate the URI correctly:

function translate_uri($uri) {
    $parts = explode('/', $uri);
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($parts); $i++) {
      $parts[$i] = rawurlencode($parts[$i]);
    }
    return implode('/', $parts);
}

because if you do rawurlencode() over the whole URI, path separator characters
'/' are also encoded and request will not happen to be correct.  '/' characters
should not be encoded, only those parts in between.

hope this helps someone like me...

About the ";" reserved character in URLs:

rawurlencode() will encode it with a "%2A" triplet. When used on the path part
of a URL, this will break the usage defined in URL RFCs, that allows specifying
additional parameters to *EACH* element of a path (separated by "/").

So if a path element contains a ";" character (some filesystems allow it, but
this is not recommanded) as part of a directory name, this character must be
encoded so that it won't be mixed with a parameter extension.

This mapping is allowed on URLs that use a hierarchical scheme (HTTP, HTTPS,
FTP, FILE, ...), so that each path element prefixed by "/" can have additional
navigational parameters such as authorization strings or semantic parameters.

The generic format of a path element may include path elements such as:
"/." or "/.." or "/.specialname" or "/regularname"
Each part may be followed by a ";" and other parameters separated by ";". These
parameters can be eithger ordered or unordered. Unordered parameters have a
symbolic name separated from their value with an equal sign.

Do not mix path element parameters with a query string: these parameters are
directly attached to the individual path element, and this makes a difference
when this path element is not the last one of the URL. These parameters are
part of the resource name (unlike the query string), and the semantic of "."
and ".." apply to the full path element with its parameters, so that:
"/subdir1/subdir2/page.html;charset=UTF-8/../index.html"
will resolve to "/subdir1/index.html".

Note that:
"/subdir1/subdir2/page.html;charset=UTF-8"
designates a DISTINCT resource name from:
"/subdir1/subdir2/page.html"
It does not necessarily involves a query, and so it can be cached by default
(unlike URLs that contain a query string).

When using path element parameters, their optional name and required value must
be rawurlencode()'d separately before inserting ";" and "=" parameters and
creating the path elements that will be imploded in the full path.

The consequence is that you MUST not urlencode() or rawurlencode individual
path elements, without first parsing them:
- first explode the path into its path lements separated by "/"
- then explode each path element in their name and parameters separated by ";"
characters
- then split path element parameters that contain a "=" sign into a name/value
pair.
- make sure that unordered path paremeters (that have been cut according to "="
into a pair) are specified *after* ordered parameters (including the main path
element name) in each path element, and that no two unordered parameters have
the same name (this restriction does not occur on unordered, unnamed parameters
which only supply a value).
- finally you can interpret rawurlencoded names and values that constitute each
path element.

Note also that some non-compliant HTTP servers consider that named parameters
are ordered, and don't add a semantic to the ";" and "=" used to break up the
list of path element parameters. On client agents, when validating URLs, it's
best then not to try to interpret this list, and you should just split the main
part of a path element and the parameters list by isolating the first ";" that
introduces this list. However, the encoded parameter list cannot include any "/
" parameter.

Caveats: note that path element parameters (introduced by ";") may be used on
upper levels of a hierarchic URL, even before the final document name and its
query parameters. When building lists of URLs, you should not separate URLs
blindly with a ";" separator, as each URL may include a ";" character, in their
path part (the ";" character cannot ocur safely in a query string). In that
case, use a surrounding pair such as "<>" or quotes to enclose each URL in such
a list.

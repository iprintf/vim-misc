===============================================================================

When calling imap_close($mbox), notices will be generated for each error that
has occurred within the imap functions.  To suppress these error messages
(including Mailbox is empty, which is not really an error) simply call
imap_errors() and then imap_close($mbox).
===============================================================================

For those curious, this function will return a linear array of strings as
opposed to say error_get_last which returns an associative array of different
things.

e.g.

[0 => '[TRYCREATE] No folder {imap.gmail.com} (Failure)']
===============================================================================

If you do not use imap_errors() to clear the error stack, any errors that
remain at the end of the script execution will be raised as PHP Notices.

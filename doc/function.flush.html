flush

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

flush — 刷新输出缓冲

说明

void flush ( void )

刷新PHP程序的缓冲，而不论PHP执行在何种情况下（CGI ，web服务器等等）。该函数将当
前为止程序的所有输出发送到用户的浏览器。

flush() 函数不会对服务器或客户端浏览器的缓存模式产生影响。因此，必须同时使用 
ob_flush() 和flush() 函数来刷新输出缓冲。

个别web服务器程序，特别是Win32下的web服务器程序，在发送结果到浏览器之前，仍然会
缓存脚本的输出，直到程序结束为止。

有些Apache的模块，比如mod_gzip，可能自己进行输出缓存，这将导致flush()函数产生的
结果不会立即被发送到客户端浏览器。

甚至浏览器也会在显示之前，缓存接收到的内容。例如 Netscape 浏览器会在接受到换行
或 html 标记的开头之前缓存内容，并且在接受到 </table> 标记之前，不会显示出整个
表格。

一些版本的 Microsoft Internet Explorer 只有当接受到的256个字节以后才开始显示该
页面，所以必须发送一些额外的空格来让这些浏览器显示页面内容。

This will show each line at a time with a pause of 2 seconds.
(Tested under IEx and Firefox)

<?php

if (ob_get_level() == 0) ob_start();

for ($i = 0; $i<10; $i++){

        echo "<br> Line to show.";
        echo str_pad('',4096)."\n";

For a Windows system using IIS, the ResponseBufferLimit takes precedence over
PHP's output_buffering settings. So you must also set the ResponseBufferLimit
to be something lower than its default value.

For IIS versions older than 7, the setting can be found in the %windir%\
System32\inetsrv\fcgiext.ini file (the FastCGI config file). You can set the
appropriate line to:
  ResponseBufferLimit=0

For IIS 7+, the settings are stored in %windir%\System32\inetsrv\config. Edit
the applicationHost.config file and search for PHP_via_FastCGI (assuming that
you have installed PHP as a FastCGI module, as per the installation
instructions, with the name PHP_via_FastCGI). Within the add tag, place the
following setting at the end:
  responseBufferLimit="0"
So the entire line will look something like:
  <add name="PHP_via_FastCGI" path="*.php" verb="*" modules="FastCgiModule"
scriptProcessor="C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe" resourceType="Either" responseBufferLimit=
"0" />
Alternatively you can insert the setting using the following command:
  %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config /section:handlers "/[name=
'PHP_via_FastCGI'].ResponseBufferLimit:0"

ob_flush();flush();

Not the other way around, because it wont work.
===============================================================================

I would like to point out that there is a function to replace ob_flush and
flush. If you set ob_implicit_flush(true); at the top of the page it will
automatically flush any echo or print you do in the rest of the script.

Note that you still need a minimum amount of data to come through the browser
filter. I would advice using str_pad($text,4096); since this automatically
lenghtens the text with spaces to 4 KB which is the minimum limit when using
FireFox and linux.

I hope this helps you all out a bit.
===============================================================================

Netscape will flush the output as expected at the point it is called from
within your script. IE, however, needs a boost.

IE seems to have a condition where it will flush data when it hits an end (</
table>) tag AND has at least 256 chars of data.

So, pad your output with necessary spaces, wrap your progressing data around
open (<table>) and end (</table>) tags, and then call flush() so that one
script will work for Netscape as well.

TESTING ENVIRONMENT
IE: Ver/6.0.2800
Netscape: Ver/7.1
PHP: Ver/4.3.4
Apache: Ver/1.3.27
===============================================================================

This is what I use to turn off pretty much anything that could cause unwanted
output buffering and turn on implicit flush:

<?php

    @apache_setenv('no-gzip', 1);
    @ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);
    @ini_set('implicit_flush', 1);
    for ($i = 0; $i < ob_get_level(); $i++) { ob_end_flush(); }
    ob_implicit_flush(1);

?>

If it still fails though, keep in mind that Internet Explorer and Safari have a
1k buffer before incremental rendering kicks in, so you'll want to output some
padding as well.
===============================================================================

Sorry if this is off topic, but it's the closest place I could find :)  I had
an issue with essentially running a CPU intensive task while updating the
browser with a progress bar via javascript and flushing the buffer a lot.

When the script was running, it effectively blocked other pages from running. 
I had a few extra httpd_preforks processes just waiting to be used, but they
just sat there.  I wasn't reading a file, locking database tables or anything
that I would suspect an exclusive lock on, just outputting a bunch of text to
the browser.  I even tried throttling my loops to see if it was processor
related but still had problems.

Finally, I found this in the php.ini file and changed the On to Off and it
worked.

[Sockets]
; Use the system read() function instead of the php_read() wrapper.
sockets.use_system_read = Off

Posting in case someone else has the same issue (or if someone knows why this
would make a difference :) ).
===============================================================================

After searching through the PHP site, google and various forums, not finding a
solution to my script not outputting anything while calling flush and ob_flush,
I thought of trying to tell PHP to call:

session_write_close();

before starting echo'ing. It worked like a charm. I couldn't find any
references to this, so I hope this note will help someone in the future.
===============================================================================

If flush() function does not work. You must set next options in php.ini like:

--[code]--
output_buffering = Off 
;output_handler =  
zlib.output_compression = Off 
;zlib.output_handler =  
--[^code^]--

If things does not work you must view headers from the server and check `Server
` string.
In my case, as the frontend was Nginx webserver and Apache work as backend.
Accordingly, buffering must be disabled in Nginx config file.
To stop buffering you must add next string to config file:

--[code]--
proxy_buffering off;
--[^code^]--

and restart Nginx daemon.  More information about  configuration you find in
documentation on the nginx website.
===============================================================================

On Windows xampp 1.3 with php 4.3.4 is use this functions
to force a flush.
<?php
function dummyErrorHandler ($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
}

function forceFlush() {   
    ob_start();
    ob_end_clean();
    flush();
    set_error_handler("dummyErrorHandler");
    ob_end_flush();
    restore_error_handler();
}
?>

ob_end_flush generates a warning, which is supressed, using the
dummy-errorhander. You could also use @, but then nusphere will also print the
warning.
===============================================================================

Regarding Apache2
flush() will produce the same results as ob_flush() when output buffering is
involved.
===============================================================================

Like IE, Safari needs a fair amount of data before it'll display anything,
actually more than explorer.  The following code works for me in Firefox and
Safari, and should work in IE as well.

<?php

for($i = 0; $i < 40000; $i++)
{
echo ' '; // extra spaces
}
// keeps it flowing to the browser 
flush();
// 50000 microseconds keeps things flowing in safari, IE, firefox, etc
usleep(50000);

?>

This code came from a comment on a blog discussing browser functionality with
flush();
===============================================================================

IE 7, Opera 9.6, any. All is quite simple. Today I just fogot what i do every
night, :)

<?php
// All you need is 256 spaces first
echo str_repeat(" ", 256)."<pre>"; flush();

// and ANY TAG before \r\n
echo "working...<br/>\r\n"; flush(); sleep(1); // this in cycle
?>
===============================================================================

It is a bit complicated to work with the funktion flush() and you have to
experiment with it a bit.
So if you design a site which has a timeloop at the end that calls a other site
via a form data input (Data Submit) you have
to give something out to the buffer to get that new site loaden quick.

For example:

<?php
$instant=gettimeofday();
$timenow=$instant["sec"];//Start Time

//timeloop(e.g. for security_save after 30 min)
while (1) { echo "<b></b>";//Useless (only to quickload next
                                    //or same Site when do a switch)
flush();                          //giveout buffer
$instant=gettimeofday();
$timeactual=$instant["sec"]; //get Actual Time in Secs
$flag=(($timeactual>$timenow+$diff)? 1:0);//$diff=switchTime
if ($flag) { what_do_at_switch_Time();//Sec.Save etc.etc.
$timenow=$timeactual; } //Set new Start Time
sleep(5); //Or so...(Important)
} //End of while-Loop
?>

So you can programm a security save or other function in your site and if you
do a switch the upload of the new or same site (the called site) works...

In my testing, Internet Explorer 6.0 wouldn't flush anything nested in <table>
or <td> tags, regardless of padding. But at the <body> level everything flushed
with no fuss -- no padding or tags required.

Both Firefox 1.0 and Safari 2.0 could flush within tables, and both required a
tag after the text (like <br>). Safari could flush only after the first 1024
characters where received. Firefox needed at least 8 characters per flush (but
it could flush anything at the <body> level).

So the only thing that worked on all those browsers was this:

<html>
<body>
<?php  // not in table tags for IE
echo str_pad('',1024);  // minimum start for Safari
for ($i=10; $i>0; $i--) {
    echo str_pad("$i<br>\n",8);
    // tag after text for Safari & Firefox
    // 8 char minimum for Firefox
    flush();  // worked without ob_flush() for me
    sleep(1);
}
?>
</body>
</html>
===============================================================================

I had a bunch of problems trying to get flush working on my windows box, I
finally found a solution after reading everyones here and it not working.

1) Set output_buffering = 0
2) Set zlib.output_compression = 0

I then used Wireshark to monitor network packets, and indeed the server was
pusing the data, but the browser was not displaying it.. So it was a browser
buffer issue (I am on Firefox 13)

For me I needed to send about 1k of data before it would display the data. To
do this I added more header information..
In php.ini I set default_charset = "utf-8"
And that was enough to give me enough for the buffer issue.

You can also try doing
echo str_repeat(" ", 1024), "\n";
at the start of the script.

hope this helps
===============================================================================

If flush is not working probably mod_gzip is enabled.
To disable it just add following lines to .htaccess

<IfModule mod_gzip.c>
mod_gzip_on no
</IfModule>
===============================================================================

This helped me getting flushing to work.
Using apache with deflate.

Turning compression off for this script: (add it somewhere at the top of the
script)
apache_setenv('no-gzip', '1');

However, this only works if php is running as a module rather than a
cgi-extension and safe mode must be disabled.

You can also turn the compression off for a directory by making a .htaccess
file and adding the following entry:
mod_gzip_on Off

However that affects the whole directory.
Hope I could help.

mod_security 2.x core rules will also prevent flush() from working.
===============================================================================

I just had some problems with flush() and ob_flush(). What I did to resolve
this problem took me some time to figure out so I'd like to share what I came
up with.

The main problem is the php setting "output_buffering" which can be set too
large and will prevent your text from outputting. To change this value you can
either set it in php.ini or you can add the line

php_value output_buffering "0"

to your .htaccess file. It will not work with ini_set() since it is
PHP_INI_PERDIR.

Next thing is to begin with ob_start();
Then you need
ob_flush();
flush();
before any echo or print.

Your code might look like this:

<?php
ob_start();

for($i=0;$i<70;$i++)
{
    echo 'printing...<br />';
    ob_flush();
    flush();

    usleep(300000);
}

?>

Hope this helps anyone with the same problems.

had problems flushing tables to screen.
this worked for me

<?php
if (ob_get_level() == 0) ob_start();
loop{
    tables and stuff
    echo str_pad("<br>\n",8);
}
ob_flush();
flush();  // needed ob_flush
usleep(50000);// delay minimum of .05 seconds to allow ie to flush to screen

Hello,

I had the same problems with sending a javascript after the <body></body>
content has been sent to the browser (the script updates the content of an
iframe).

Two solutions work for me:
   - add enough data (i.e.: extra dummy text like spaces) or,
   - echo the '</body>' tag at the end of the page

Note, that for the latter to work one should:
   - turn of output_buffering in php.ini and either:
      * turn on implicit_flush in its php.ini or,
      * call ob_implicit_flush(); at the beginning of a script

I preferr echoing the '</body>' tag at the end as it doesn't require any extra
data to be sent over the wire and its much a neater coding technique.

Notes:
   - these worakarounds aren't needed when using perl and cgi,... .
   - you can leave the zlib.output_compression in your php.ini switched on

Kind regards and hoped this is of any help.

I figured out a way to create a simple progress bar that is for the most part
cross platform. Seeing as I got my ideas from this site it's only share to give
back to the community.

Note: Something interesting about browser buffering... you have to have the
<html><body> for Firefox and some other browsers to recognize items by their id
in Javascript. So I recommend using some sort of header function before calling
this function.

<?php

function fn_progress_bar($intCurrentCount = 100, $intTotalCount = 100)
{
    static $intNumberRuns = 0;
    static $intDisplayedCurrentPercent = 0;
    $strProgressBar = '';
    $dblPercentIncrease = (100 / $intTotalCount);
    $intCurrentPercent = intval($intCurrentCount * $dblPercentIncrease);
    $intNumberRuns++;
       
    if(1 == $intNumberRuns)
    {
        $strProgressBar = <<< BAR
<table width='50%' id='progress_bar' summary='progress_bar' align='center'>
<tbody><tr>
<td id='progress_bar_complete' width='0%' align='center' style='background:#
CCFFCC;'>&nbsp;</td>
<td style='background:#FFCCCC;'>&nbsp;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript'>
function dhd_fn_progress_bar_update(intCurrentPercent)
{
    document.getElementById('progress_bar_complete').style.width =
intCurrentPercent+'%';
    document.getElementById('progress_bar_complete').innerHTML =
intCurrentPercent+'%';
}
</script>
BAR;
    }
    else if($intDisplayedCurrentPercent <> $intCurrentPercent)
    {
        $intDisplayedCurrentPercent = $intCurrentPercent;
        $strProgressBar = <<< BAR
<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript'>
dhd_fn_progress_bar_update($intCurrentPercent);
</script>
BAR;
    }
    if(100 <= $intCurrentPercent)
    {
        $intNumberRuns = $intDisplayedCurrentPercent = 0;
        $strProgressBar = <<< BAR
<script type='text/javascript' language='javascript'>
document.getElementById('progress_bar').style.visibility='hidden';
</script>
BAR;
    }
    echo $strProgressBar;
    flush();
    ob_flush();
}

?>

combining some ideas i was finally able to get a long running script to give me
real time feedback on what it was doing.  this was a wamp setup with php
running as cgi.  i'm pretty sure that apache just wasn't sending any of the
buffered output because it was trying to be helpful. also trying to be helpful,
i hope this example solution helps someone.

<?php
// thx mandor at mandor
ini_set('max_execution_time', 0);
ini_set('implicit_flush', 1);
ob_implicit_flush(1);

echo 'doing something';  my_flush();
sleep(5);
echo 'doing something else'; my_flush();
sleep(5);
echo 'finally done - hooray';

function my_flush() {
  // following matt at hevanet's lead
  for ($i=0;$i<10000;$i++) echo ' ';
  ob_flush();
  flush();
}
===============================================================================

I've spent days trying to figure out why flush didn't work all of a sudden,
while it used to work perfectly. Apparently, it was McAfee Spamkiller that
caused problems. Disabling it didn't work, I had to completely remove it. Hope
this helps someone.
===============================================================================

If you're not explictly using the buffering functions, then ob_flush() is only
necessary if output buffering is turned on in your php.ini file.

flush() is only necessary if implicit_flush is turned off in your php.ini file.
Setting implicit_flush to on will remove the need for all these flush() calls,
but it's generally only good in an extremely controlled environment. Turning on
implicit_flush in a production environment can be bad.
===============================================================================

Hi all.
Been scratching my head over data NOT flushed to IE (6) even though I tried
strpad 4096 chars, all headers OK,  TABLE and no TABLE, flush and ob_flush -
still a blank page. Tried adding a sleep(1) before flushing - and everything
worked as a charm.

===============================================================================

This is an extention of Rusty's comment below:

After sitting here for hours trying to make IE6 flush data out in the middle of
a page (with it working perfectly in Firefox), I finally figured out the
problem. IE will not display flushed data (even if it has it) unless the table
that contains it is complete.

Every new element you want IE to display must not be in ANY kind of table at
all. You must end all your tables.
===============================================================================

Many of the suggestions below are very helpful but I would just like to clarify
something. 

If you are making calls to a .php script with AJAX (xmlHttpReq) and use flush,
this will send data to your script HOWEVER it will not set the
xmlHttpReq.readyState to 4 -- which is a requirement to use the information
sent (Firefox does however allow you to use the responseText property with a
readyState == 3 but IE will throw an error).

To get around this, you will need to make sure of a couple things:

In your Apache php.ini config file, check to make sure that output buffering is
disabled:

output_buffering = off

Next, disable gzip compression for the .php script that is called from your
AJAX script by using the excellent suggestion from Mandor by placing the
following at the top of your script:

@apache_setenv('no-gzip', 1);
@ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);

What causes this problem is that while the php child process is running under
apache, apache is waiting for the script to complete before completely closing
the connection.  Scripts that send information directly to the browser with
echos and prints will get away with using flush followed by a sleep command and
then clean up procedures.  However, if you notice in the status bar of your
browser window, the connection is still held open by apache until the script
completed ("Transferring" ... yadda yadda).

By turning off the Apache compression, the connection is terminated directly
after a flush while still giving the user the ability to run a sleep command
followed by clean up code.

This bit me because the AJAX was returning <img> tags to newly created images
by php.  The cleanup script would then remove those images after completion. 

Since Apache held the connection open, the readyState only changed to 4 AFTER
my php cleanup fired -- thereby erasing the links referred to my the <img>
tags.

With this solution, the readyState will change to 4 BEFORE the sleep command
begins.

I hope this saves someone a lot of time and frustration.  AJAX requests are an
entirely different beast compared with simple outputting to a browser window.
===============================================================================

in order to display in HTML pages something like a "progress bar" or if you
want to force the web server to flush output to the browser, or the browser to
flush as well, you can print a long enough "dummy" string to make the output
buffer grow, as you probably know, like:

<?php
print "[";

for($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++){
  $spaces.=" ";
} // for

//and then

for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++){
  for($ii = 0; $ii < 200000; $ii++){
    //do something slow here
  } // for
  print "$spaces|";
  flush();
} // for

print "]";

/*
but this somethin may be not really what you expect in
a progress bar, as it prints spaces (although rendered as single by the
browser) between the bar units..
you can solve this using
  $spaces.="<!-- bufferme -->";

/*

print "[";

for($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++){
  $spaces.="<!-- bufferme -->";
} // for

//and then

for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++){
  for($ii = 0; $ii < 200000; $ii++){
    //do something slow here
  } // for
  print "$spaces|";
  flush();
} // for

print "]";

//which looks nice as a progress bar..
?>
===============================================================================

Try to add more white spaces if your ob_flush() and flush() don't work,
especially under NGINX.
However, too many white spaces can be a challenge to your web browser.
<?php
    ob_clean();
    while(true){
        echo str_repeat(' ',1024*1024*4);
        echo 'hello, world ...<br />';
        ob_flush();
        flush();
        usleep(1000);
    }
===============================================================================

If flush() don't work remember to check if you have any antivirus caching the
data sent to the browser.

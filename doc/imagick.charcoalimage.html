===============================================================================

The parameters for this function are really scary.  Radius of the Gaussian and
Standard Deviation of the Gaussian?  After playing with it for a little bit, I
think I put it together.  The Gaussian is the "brush" (in Gimp/Photoshop
jargin), the radius is simply the radius of the brush, and the standard
deviation is the level of variation among the sizes of the brush imprints.  The
$radius parameter can be anything from 0 to as high a number as you can think,
but once you beyond 10, 20, or 30 pixels, depending on the image size, the
whole image gets blurred beyond useful recognition.  The $sigma, being the
standard deviation, should be smaller than your radius to get the desired
effect.  Think of it as "Charcoal Brushes of $radius Pixels Size, with each
brush being as much as $sigma Pixels bigger or smaller than that."

For an average 500 x 500 pixel image, you'll probably want a $radius of 3 to 5
and a $sigma of 1 to 3, but you can go as far as 10 pixels generally before the
image is blurred beyond recognition.  (At the moment, $radius: 5 / $sigma: 2 is
the perfect blend for this 400x400 image that I'm working on right now.)

There was not too help from the official documentation site for this project,
either: http://www.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/image1.html .  The authors there
note: "You can alter the intensity of the effect by changing the radius and
sigma arguments."  So, my description here of the functioning is based mostly
on experience rather than documentation, which is difficult to find.

The following is the entire code for applying the effect to an image.  This
code will open the specified file, it will apply the charcoalImage effect to
it, and then it will save it to another specified file.  The arguments are
served up through POST data, and the only functions of the ImageMagick class
that are used are the readImageFile, charcoalImage, and writeImageFile, as so :

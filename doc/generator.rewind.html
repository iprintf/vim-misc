I'm guessing the *only* purpose for this even existing is so that it is
compatible with the Iterator interface o_O

Actually, this method can be useful to test a generator before iterating, as it
executes your function up to the first yield statement. I.e. if you try to read
a non-existent file in a generator, an error will normally occur only in client
code foreach()'s first iteration. Sometimes this can be critical to check
beforehand.

Take a look at a modified example from here:
http://php.net/manual/ru/language.generators.overview.php#112985

<?php

function getLines($file) {
    $f = fopen($file, 'r');
    try {
        while ($line = fgets($f)) {
            yield $line;
        }
    } finally {
        fclose($f);
    }
}

$getLines = getLines('no_such_file.txt');
$getLines->rewind(); // with ->rewind(), a file read error will be thrown here
and a log file will not be cleared

openAndClearLogFile();

foreach ($getLines as $n => $line) { // without ->rewind(), the script will die
here and your log file will be cleared
    writeToLogFile('reading: ' . $line . "\n");
}

closeLogFile();

?>

P.S.: When you iterate over a generator after ->rewind(), you'll get the first
yielded value immediately, as the preceding code was already executed.

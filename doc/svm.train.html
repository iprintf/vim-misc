SVM::train — Create a SVMModel based on training data

说明

public SVMModel svm::train ( array $problem [, array $weights ] )

Train a support vector machine based on the supplied training data.

参数

problem

    The problem can be provided in three different ways. An array, where the
    data should start with the class label (usually 1 or -1) then followed by a
    sparse data set of dimension => data pairs. A URL to a file containing a
    SVM Light formatted problem, with the each line being a new training
    example, the start of each line containing the class (1, -1) then a series
    of tab separated data values shows as key:value. A opened stream pointing
    to a data source formatted as in the file above.

weights

    Weights are an optional set of weighting parameters for the different
    classes, to help account for unbalanced training sets. For example, if the
    classes were 1 and -1, and -1 had significantly more example than one, the
    weight for -1 could be 0.5. Weights should be in the range 0-1.

返回值

Returns an SVMModel that can be used to classify previously unseen data. Throws
SVMException on error

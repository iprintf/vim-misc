MongoGridFS::put — Stores a file in the database

说明

public mixed MongoGridFS::put ( string $filename [, array $metadata = array()
[, array $options = array() ]] )


    Note:

    MongoGridFS::put() is an alias of MongoGridFS::storeFile().

参数

filename

    Name of the file to store.

metadata

    Other metadata fields to include in the file document.

        Note:

        These fields may also overwrite those that would be created
        automatically by the driver, as described in the MongoDB core
        documentation for the » files collection. Some practical use cases for
        this behavior would be to specify a custom chunkSize or _id for the
        file.

options

    An array of options for the insert operations executed against the chunks
    and files collections. See MongoCollection::insert() for documentation on
    these these options.

返回值

Returns the _id of the saved file document. This will be a generated MongoId
unless an _id was explicitly specified in the extra parameter.

错误／异常

Throws MongoGridFSException if there is an error reading filename or inserting
into the chunks or files collections.

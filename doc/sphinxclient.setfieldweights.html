SphinxClient::setFieldWeights — Set field weights

说明

public bool SphinxClient::setFieldWeights ( array $weights )

Binds per-field weights by name.

Match ranking can be affected by per-field weights. See » Sphinx documentation
for an explanation on how phrase proximity ranking is affected. This call lets
you specify non-default weights for full-text fields.

The weights must be positive 32-bit integers, so be careful not to hit 32-bit
integer maximum. The final weight is a 32-bit integer too. Default weight value
is 1. Unknown field names are silently ignored.

参数

weights

    Associative array of field names and field weights.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

although the specs (both php & sphinx manuals) states that field weight should
be positive integer, values lower than 1 (0 for example) would not work. Found
this on a blog and i hope this will help you ...

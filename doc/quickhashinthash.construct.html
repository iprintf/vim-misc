(PECL quickhash >= Unknown)

QuickHashIntHash::__construct — Creates a new QuickHashIntHash object

说明

public QuickHashIntHash::__construct ( int $size [, int $options ] )

This constructor creates a new QuickHashIntHash. The size is the amount of
bucket lists to create. The more lists there are, the less collisions you will
have. Options are also supported.

参数

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 64 to 4194304.

options

    The options that you can pass in are: QuickHashIntHash::CHECK_FOR_DUPES,
    which makes sure no duplicate entries are added to the hash;
    QuickHashIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC to not use PHP's internal memory
    manager as well as one of QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_NO_HASH,
    QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_JENKINS1 or QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_JENKINS2.
    These last three configure which hashing algorithm to use. All options can
    be combined using bitmasks.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntHash object.

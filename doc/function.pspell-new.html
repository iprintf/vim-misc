pspell_new — Load a new dictionary

说明

int pspell_new ( string $language [, string $spelling [, string $jargon [, 
string $encoding [, int $mode = 0 ]]]] )

pspell_new() opens up a new dictionary and returns the dictionary link
identifier for use in other pspell functions.

For more information and examples, check out inline manual pspell website:
» http://aspell.net/.

参数

language

    The language parameter is the language code which consists of the two
    letter ISO 639 language code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country
    code after a dash or underscore.

spelling

    The spelling parameter is the requested spelling for languages with more
    than one spelling such as English. Known values are 'american', 'british',
    and 'canadian'.

jargon

    The jargon parameter contains extra information to distinguish two
    different words lists that have the same language and spelling parameters.

encoding

    The encoding parameter is the encoding that words are expected to be in.
    Valid values are 'utf-8', 'iso8859-*', 'koi8-r', 'viscii', 'cp1252',
    'machine unsigned 16', 'machine unsigned 32'. This parameter is largely
    untested, so be careful when using.

mode

    The mode parameter is the mode in which spellchecker will work. There are
    several modes available:
      □ PSPELL_FAST - Fast mode (least number of suggestions)
      □ PSPELL_NORMAL - Normal mode (more suggestions)
      □ PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS - Slow mode (a lot of suggestions)
      □ PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER - Consider run-together words as legal compounds.
        That is, "thecat" will be a legal compound, although there should be a
        space between the two words. Changing this setting only affects the
        results returned by pspell_check(); pspell_suggest() will still return
        suggestions.
    Mode is a bitmask constructed from different constants listed above.
    However, PSPELL_FAST, PSPELL_NORMAL and PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS are mutually
    exclusive, so you should select only one of them.

返回值

Returns the dictionary link identifier on success 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 pspell_new()

<?php
$pspell_link = pspell_new("en", "", "", "",
                           (PSPELL_FAST|PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER));
?>

===============================================================================

Just as a small tip, I noticed that when you call pspell_new multiple times,
php does not free memory usage when the resource is destroyed, but only when
your entire script has completely finished. So if you create a pspell_link
resource and you intend to use it again somewhere else, instead of calling
pspell_new again, keep track of your original pspell_link resource
instantiation, and use it again, your script will run much more efficiently.

I was switching between 16 dictionaries by just calling a new pspell_new
everytime, my memory usage on the server grew until i hit a failure/php core
dump. :-/ So i stored each pspell resource in an array keyed by language, and
checked if the resource existed first, before creating one if needed.

I hope that helps someone.
===============================================================================

I think the language and spelling parameters differs on different PHP versions
and/or aspell/UNIX distributions.

My PHP 5.2.6 Debian ignores the spelling parameter.

Instead:

For Americans use en_US as language.
For British use en_GB (not en_UK)
For Canadian use en_CA

===============================================================================

imap_timeout(1, <seconds>) works fine for pop3 connections, but apparently not
for pop3s (ssl, port 995) connections, where the default socket timeout still
applies.
This applies to php 4.3.10, not tested on other versions.
===============================================================================

We looked into the source to find out what this function actually does and how
to use it. The function overrides the default_socket_timeout setting from your
php.ini file 

You can retrieve the current timeout length for each timeout type by calling
the function as:

  imap_timeout(timeout_type);
     or
  imap_timeout(timeout_type,-1);

You can set the timeout length for any of the timeout types by setting the
timeout value to a number of seconds.

  imap_timeout(timeout_type,<number of seconds>);

The timeout types are as follows:

1: Open
2: Read
3: Write
4: Close

It does not appear that the close type has been implemented.

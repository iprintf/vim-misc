gmp_strval — Convert GMP number to string

说明

string gmp_strval ( GMP $gmpnumber [, int $base = 10 ] )

Convert GMP number to string representation in base base. The default base is
10.

参数

gmpnumber

    The GMP number that will be converted to a string.

    可以是一个 GMP 数据 resouce，或一个可以转换为数值的字符串。

base

    The base of the returned number. The default base is 10. Allowed values for
    the base are from 2 to 62 and -2 to -36.

返回值

The number, as a string.

更新日志

版本                              说明
5.3.2 The base was extended from 2 to 36, to 2 to 62 and -2 to -36.

注释

    Note:

    To use the extended base introduced in PHP 5.3.2, then PHP must be compiled
    against GMP 4.2.0 or greater.

范例

Example #1 Converting a GMP number to a string

<?php
$a = gmp_init("0x41682179fbf5");
printf("Decimal: %s, 36-based: %s", gmp_strval($a), gmp_strval($a,36));
?>

===============================================================================

It may be worth noting that using gmp_strval can slow your script down a lot
with large numbers.

This script for example, produces factorials in succession:
<?php

$start = microtime(TRUE);

$fact = gmp_init(1, 10);
for($i=1;$i<100000;$i++) { // calculates 100,000 factorials
  $fact = gmp_mul($fact, $i); // $fact is now the result of the $ith factorial
  // gmp_strval($fact, 10); // see below...
  if(microtime(TRUE)-$start>1) // stop calculating after 1 second
    break;
}
// print whatever result that took 1 second to complete
printf("\$i = %d\n\$fact = %s\n", gmp_strval($fact, 10));

?>

My server calculates around about the 69,500th factorial on average every time.
Uncommenting that gmp_strval line slows this process down dramatically, and
only calculates about 5,000 factorials. This is about 14 times longer than
before (this is consistent with allowing it to run for any number of seconds,
not just 1).

Nitrogen.
===============================================================================

A gotcha when using the value from gmp_strval as a key in an associative array.
Some numbers are 2^31 are converted to signed integer format, this is usually
incorrect.

<?php

$a = gmp_init('2147483649'); // = 2^31 + 1
$b = gmp_init('3173604585'); // = 2^31 < $b < 2^32

$c = gmp_strval($a);
$d = gmp_strval($b);

$e = array($c => 'c', $d => 'd');

print '*** Expect '."\n";
print 'Array '."\n".'('."\n".'    ['.$c.'] => c'."\n".'    ['.$d.'] => d'."\n".
')'."\n\n";
print '*** Actual '."\n";
print_r($e);

?>

Output:

*** Expect
Array
(
    [2147483649] => c
    [3173604585] => d
)

*** Actual
Array
(
    [-2147483647] => c
    [3173604585] => d
)

A workaround is to format as base 16 and append '0x' before using as a key.

I think it's no longer necessary to worry about trailing nulls. This was fixed
in Feb 2002 (see bug 10133)
===============================================================================

Warning: gmp_strval may return a null terminated string (e.g., gmp_strval
(gmp_init(8)) has two characters. This is because gmp is built for speed, so
uses estimates based on things it can get quickly, like the number of bits in
N. So since 8 is a 4 bit number, it will be allocated ceil(log10(2^4))=ceil
(4*0.30103....) = 2 characters. The gmp folks feel it is the caller's
responsibility (in this case the PHP interface) to check whether or not all the
characters were required.  PHP might have done this for us (and may in the
future), but for now, you need to check (if it matters to you--it sure did in
my program!).

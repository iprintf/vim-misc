EZ Mailing List Manager (EZMLM) is a mailing list manager which allows users to
create their own mailing lists with a single command.

It seems to require qmail.

See:
http://www.ezmlm.org/
http://www.qmail.org/top.html#ezmlm
===============================================================================

ezmlm will add a user to the list from a mail() call if you use the -f extra
flag in the function.
Example:

mail($to,$title,$email,$headers,"-tfromemail@example.com");

The extra flag being a -t followed by no space and the email address you want
the email to appear as though it's being sent from. I spent hours messing with
this to try to allow users to sign up for my mailing list by marking a check
box while signing up on my site, ezmlm ignored everything until I threw that
extra parameter in there.

Hope this helps.

This is really ezmlm documentation, but I certanly would have been happy if I
found it anywhere during my time of trial. I am not a Linux expert, as you
probably will notice, so things I do/did that might sound incredibly stupid to
those who do know. I blame hard-to-find documentation :)

I wanted a page where a visitor could add their address to my mailinglist. That
shouldn't be too hard, or atleastso I thought...

First I tried mailing the mailinglist. For some reason, the mailinglist didn't
see my "From:" -header and it failed miserably.

Then I tried to use system() to call ezmlm-sub, which only produced the
error-code 111. That was an access problem. So, I tried making the mailinglist
availible to the website, but the change in permissions caused the mailserver
to malfunction (as opposed to mailfunction....). It took a while to sort that
mess out.

I couldn't find any guide as howto add mysql-support. The big problem was how
to know which tables was needed. Apperantly, this is all that is needed:

ezmlm-mktab listname | mysql -u root -p databasename

Then its just adding the mailinglist with mysql-support i qmailadmin. It
doesn't seem to allow socket connection to the database, so iptables has to
allow local connections to the mysql port.

Hope this helps someone.

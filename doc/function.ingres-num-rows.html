ingres_num_rows — Get the number of rows affected or returned by a query

说明

int ingres_num_rows ( resource $result )

This function primarily is meant to get the number of rows modified in the
database. However, it can be used to retrieve the number of rows to fetch for a
SELECT statement.

    Note:

    If scrollable cursors are disabled and this function is called before using
    ingres_fetch_array(), ingres_fetch_object(), or ingres_fetch_row(), the
    server will delete the result's data and the script will be unable to get
    them.

    Instead, you should retrieve the result's data using one of these fetch
    functions in a loop until it returns FALSE, indicating that no more results
    are available.

参数

result

    The result identifier for a query

返回值

For delete, insert, or update queries, ingres_num_rows() returns the number of
rows affected by the query. For other queries, ingres_num_rows() returns the
number of rows in the query's result.

If you want to save data that is derived from a Javascript canvas.toDataURL()
function, you have to convert blanks into plusses. If you do not do that, the
decoded data is corrupted:

<?php
  $encodedData = str_replace(' ','+',$encodedData);
  $decocedData = base64_decode($encodedData);
?>
===============================================================================

I had some trouble trying to let base64_decode decode base64-strings longer
than ~5k chars.

The base64-decoding function is a homomorphism between modulo 4 and modulo
3-length segmented strings. That motivates a divide and conquer approach: Split
the encoded string into substrings counting modulo 4 chars, then decode each
substring and concatenate all of them.

Then instead of

<?php $decoded = base64_decode($encoded); ?>

for big $encoded strings, it's saver to use

<?php
$decoded = "";
for ($i=0; $i < ceil(strlen($encoded)/256); $i++)
   $decoded = $decoded . base64_decode(substr($encoded,$i*256,256));
?>

where 256 can be replaced by a sufficiently small modulo 4 natural.
===============================================================================

Base64 for URL parameters/filenames, that adhere to RFC 4648.
Defaults to dropping the padding on encode since it's not required for
decoding, and keeps the URL free of % encodings.

<?php
function base64url_encode($data, $pad = null) {
    $data = str_replace(array('+', '/'), array('-', '_'), base64_encode($data
));
    if (!$pad) {
        $data = rtrim($data, '=');
    }
    return $data;
}
function base64url_decode($data) {
    return base64_decode(str_replace(array('-', '_'), array('+', '/'), $data));
}

To expand on Jes' post:

The change took place between 5.0.5 and 5.1.0.  Exactly where I don't know or
care.

In short php <= 5.0.5's base64_decode( $string ) will assume that a space is
meant to be a + sign where php >= 5.1.0's base64_decode( $string ) will no
longer make that assumption.  I did not see this noted in the change log.

Please note that, as of this writing, mb_convert_encoding( $string, "UTF-8",
"BASE64" ) still behaves as base64_decode( $string ) did in php <= 5.0.5
regardless of the version of php you are running.
===============================================================================

To follow up on Starson's post, PHP was changed to no longer treat a space as
if it were a plus sign in CVS revision 1.43.2.1, which corresponds to PHP
5.1.0.  You can see what happened with a diff to branch point 1.43 at:

http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/standard/base64.c

The CVS log indicates that this change was made to fix bug #34214
(base64_decode() does not properly ignore whitespace).

It would seem from the comment preceding the code which was removed that the
treatment of the space as if it were the plus sign was actually intentional at
one time:

    When Base64 gets POSTed, all pluses are interpreted as spaces.
    This line changes them back.  It's not exactly the Base64 spec,
    but it is completely compatible with it (the spec says that spaces
    are invalid).  This will also save many people considerable
    headache.

    if (ch == ' ') ch = '+';

However, RFC 3548 states that characters not in the Base64 alphabet should
either be ignored or cause the implementation to reject the encoding and RFC
2045 says they should be ignored.  So the original code was unfortunately not
fully compatible with the spec or other implementations.  It may have also
masked problems with code not properly escaping POST variables.
===============================================================================

The docs don't make this explicitly clear, but if you omit `$strict` or set it
to `false` then invalid characters in the encoded input will be silently
ignored.

<?php

echo base64_decode('VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBlbmNvZGVkIHN0cmluZw=='); // "This is an
encoded string"
echo base64_decode('$VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBlbmNvZGVkIHN0cmluZw=='); // "This is an
encoded string"
echo base64_decode('$VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBlbmNvZGVkIHN0cmluZw==', true); // false

?>

I had a problem testing whether an imap message body was base64 encoded on a
pre 5.2.* server.  I had been using this function on a post 5.2 server.

I found that the function imap_base64() returns FALSE on failing to decode a
string, and that I could use that to check instead.

<?php
if(imap_base64($body)) $body = imap_base64($body);
?>
===============================================================================

This function supports "base64url" as described in Section 5 of RFC 4648, "Base
64 Encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet"

    <?php
    function base64url_decode($base64url)
    {
        $base64 = strtr($base64url, '-_', '+/');
        $plainText = base64_decode($base64);
        return ($plainText);
    }
    ?>
===============================================================================

base64_decode seems to fail when decoding big files/strings. I had an issue
decoding a 7MB image file. Here is a solution that worked for me:

$decodedstring=base64_decode(chunk_split($encodedstring));

A better implementation would be the following regular expression:

^[a-zA-Z0-9/+]*={0,2}$

Which will also detect the usage of = or == at the end of the string (and only
end).

If this regex isn't following proper RFC guidelines, please comment on it.

A function geared specifically toward this:

<?php

function is_base64_encoded()
    {
        if (preg_match('%^[a-zA-Z0-9/+]*={0,2}$%', $data)) {
            return TRUE;
        } else {
            return FALSE;
        }
    };

is_base64_encoded("iash21iawhdj98UH3"); // true
is_base64_encoded("#iu3498r"); // false
is_base64_encoded("asiudfh9w=8uihf"); // false
is_base64_encoded("a398UIhnj43f/1!+sadfh3w84hduihhjw=="); // true

?>

I was wondering how to decode attached images within mails. Basically they are
mostly JPEG files, so it was obviously to write a function that decodes JPEG
images.
I guess the plainest way to do so was the following:

<?php
function base64_to_jpeg( $inputfile, $outputfile ) {
  /* read data (binary) */
  $ifp = fopen( $inputfile, "rb" );
  $imageData = fread( $ifp, filesize( $inputfile ) );
  fclose( $ifp );
  /* encode & write data (binary) */
  $ifp = fopen( $outputfile, "wb" );
  fwrite( $ifp, base64_decode( $imageData ) );
  fclose( $ifp );
  /* return output filename */
  return( $outputfile );
}
?>

This function decodes the given inputfile (a filename!) and saves it to the
given outputfile (a filename as well) and then returns the output filename for
further usage (e.g. redirect, imagejpeg() and so on).
I thought that might be helpful.
===============================================================================

this script can correct the bug

<?php
$enc = chunk_split(preg_replace('!\015\012|\015|\012!','',$enc));
$enc = base64_decode($enc);
?>
===============================================================================

Here is function to decode Base 62 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_62)
string to number. It is used by MTA in message id, e.g. by Exim
<?php
function base62_decode($str) {
    $ret= 0;
    for ($i= 0, $l= strlen($str); $i < $l; $i++) {
        $val= ord($str[$i]);
        if (ctype_digit($str[$i]))
            $val-= ord('0');
        else if (ctype_upper($str[$i]))
            $val-= ord('A') - 10;
        else if (ctype_lower($str[$i]))
            $val-= ord('a') - 36;
        else
            $val= 0;
        $ret= $ret * 62 + $val;
    }
    return $ret;
}
?>

I used to do uudecode as a C module, but I've discovered a really fast way to
do it in PHP. Here it is:

<?php
function uudecode($encode) {
  $b64chars="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/";

  $encode = preg_replace("/^./m","",$encode);
  $encode = preg_replace("/\n/m","",$encode);
  for($i=0; $i<strlen($encode); $i++) {
    if ($encode[$i] == '`')
      $encode[$i] = ' ';
    $encode[$i] = $b64chars[ord($encode[$i])-32];
  }

  while(strlen($encode) % 4)
    $encode .= "=";

  return base64_decode($encode);
}
?>

This is the PHP equivalent to perl's unpack("u",___). That is, you need to
strip the 'begin' and 'end' lines from the typical uuencoded file.
===============================================================================

Here is a drop-in replacement for base64_decode(), based on a faster version of
morgangalpin's code:

<?php
// workaround for bug in php 4.3.11 through 4.4.7, 5.1.2 through 5.2.4 and
perhaps others (http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37244)
function    base64_decode_fix( $data, $strict = false )
{
    if( $strict )
        if( preg_match( '![^a-zA-Z0-9/+=]!', $data ) )
            return( false );
   
    return( base64_decode( $data ) );
}
?>
===============================================================================

You can do partial decoding (e.g. from buffered input streams) if you choose a
chunk length that is multiple of 4:

<?php

$encoded = base64_encode('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog');
for($i=0, $len=strlen($encoded); $i<$len; $i+=4){
    echo base64_decode( substr($encoded, $i, 4) );
}

?>

4 encoded chars represent 3 original chars. The "=" character is used as
padding.

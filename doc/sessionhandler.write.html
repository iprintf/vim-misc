SessionHandler::write

(PHP 5 >= 5.4.0, PHP 7)

SessionHandler::write — Write session data

说明

public bool SessionHandler::write ( string $session_id , string $session_data )

Writes the session data to the session storage. Called by normal PHP shutdown,
by session_write_close(), or when session_register_shutdown() fails. PHP will
call SessionHandler::close() immediately after this method returns.

This method wraps the internal PHP save handler defined in the
session.save_handler ini setting that was set before this handler was set by 
session_set_save_handler().

If this class is extended by inheritiance, calling the parent write method will
invoke the wrapper for this method and therefor invoke the associated internal
callback. This allows this method to be overidden and or intercepted and
filtered (for example, encrypting the $data value before sending it to the
parent write method).

For more information on what this method is expected to do, please refer to the
documentation at SessionHandlerInterface::write().

参数

session_id

    The session id.

session_data

    The encoded session data. This data is the result of the PHP internally
    encoding the $_SESSION superglobal to a serialized string and passing it as
    this parameter. Please note sessions use an alternative serialization
    method.

返回值

会话存储的返回值（通常成功返回 0，失败返回 1）。

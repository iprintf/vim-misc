ob_flush

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ob_flush — 冲刷出（送出）输出缓冲区中的内容

说明

void ob_flush ( void )

这个函数将送出缓冲区的内容（如果里边有内容的话）。如果想进一步处理缓冲区中的内
容，必须在ob_flush()之前调用ob_get_contents() ，因为在调用ob_flush()之后缓冲区
内容将被丢弃。

此函数不会销毁输出缓冲区，而像ob_end_flush() 函数会销毁缓冲区。

返回值

没有返回值。

参见

  • ob_get_contents() - 返回输出缓冲区的内容
  • ob_clean() - 清空（擦掉）输出缓冲区
  • ob_end_flush() - 冲刷出（送出）输出缓冲区内容并关闭缓冲
  • ob_end_clean() - 清空（擦除）缓冲区并关闭输出缓冲

As of August 2012, all browsers seem to show an all-or-nothing approach to
buffering. In other words, while php is operating, no content can be shown.

In particular this means that the following workarounds listed further down
here are ineffective:

1) ob_flush (),  flush () in any combination with other output buffering
functions;

2) changes to php.ini involving setting output_buffer and/or
zlib.output_compression to 0 or Off;

3) setting Apache variables such as "no-gzip" either through apache_setenv ()
or through entries in .htaccess.

So, until browsers begin to show buffered content again, the tips listed here
are moot.
===============================================================================

some problems with ob_flush() and flush() could be resolved by defining content
type header :
header( 'Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8' );

so working code looks like this:
<?php
header( 'Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8' );
echo 'Begin ...<br />';
for( $i = 0 ; $i < 10 ; $i++ )
{
    echo $i . '<br />';
    flush();
    ob_flush();
    sleep(1);
}
echo 'End ...<br />';
?>
===============================================================================

If you call ob_flush() and flush() and still dont get the buffer flushed it
might be because some antivirus software (Panda in this case) holds the buffer
until the page has finished loaded before sending it to the browser.
===============================================================================

Although browsers now have an all or none buffering strategy, the arguments are
not moot.

If you are not using ob_flush, you run this risk of exceeding socket timeouts
(commonly seen in php-fpm/nginx combos).

Basically, flushing solves the infamous 504 Gateway Time-out error.
===============================================================================

If you're still not getting the buffer work correctly then try to clean all the
others before starting your own (and even if PHP tells you that there are no
buffers active):

while(@ob_end_clean());
===============================================================================

As stated in flush() manual entry, if php compresses the ouput with zlib this
function may be ineffective.

A possible option for folders on your server that have scripts which may take a
long time to run is to add the following in your relevant .htaccess file:

<FilesMatch "\.(php|html?)$">
php_flag zlib.output_compression off
php_value max_execution_time 3000
php_value max_input_time 3000
</FilesMatch>

Currently I have Chrome on OS X Snow Leopard updating a page as it is sent more
data, BUT it only does this after I send it <body> along with 1013 more
characters (making 1019 total characters). After it receives this it
immediately displays it and then displays anything else as it is received.
(Note that this browser-operating system combination isn't necessarily the only
one, it's just the only one I've tested.)

In order to do this using php, I've done nothing but send ob_flush() after each
echo or print. I can also make it happen without ob_flush() by calling
ob_implicit_flush(), then ob_end_flush() before print, and then it updates with
each print after that. I have pretty typical settings and I change none of them
when the file runs, it literally looks like this:

<?php
  ob_implicit_flush();
  ob_end_flush();
  ?><body>[1013 more characters]<?php
  for ($i = 1; $i < 30000000; ++$i) {}
  echo "something that didn't show up immediately";
?>

(Ok, the "[1013 more characters]" part wasn't strictly literal.)

If you want just text in the browser, you do this before everything else:

<?php
header("Content-type: text/plain");
...
?>

Then it won't care whether you sent a body tag, it will just wait for 1019
characters.
===============================================================================

You must call them in the correct order.
ob_flush();
flush();

I was having problems with output buffering which seemed to be active by
default on the server, although phpinfo said something else..

In any case I needed to know that when I ran ob_start, it would start at the
top level, so I could use ob_flush as it's intended without having to call
multiple ob_flush in-script - this is what I did:

<?php

// make sure output buffering is off before we start it
// this will ensure same effect whether or not ob is enabled already
while (ob_get_level()) {
    ob_end_flush();
}
// start output buffering
if (ob_get_length() === false) {
    ob_start();
}

?>

Then I could call ob_flush(); followed by flush(); and get the output I wanted,
which I didn't if I started the script with just ob_start();

This was on a windows apache 2 server with php 5.0.4 btw.
===============================================================================

when using command line php, if somewhere in your script you have ob_start(),
you have to call ob_end_flush() first, and then you can call these functions:
flush();
ob_flush();

without calling ob_end_flush first, flush and ob_flush does not have any
effect, at least that's what I experienced.
===============================================================================

For some reason, calling just flush or ob_flush or even both together did not
get my output buffers flushed, and calling ob_end_flush by itself didn't work
either but calling them all worked well. Here is my new output flushing
function.

<?php
function flush_buffers(){
    ob_end_flush();
    ob_flush();
    flush();
    ob_start();
}
?>

Enjoy
===============================================================================

we had problems with flushing data to the browser. a simple call to ob_flush()
or flush() would not work. We found that repeatly calling theses fuctions did
work however.

<?
flush();
ob_flush();
flush();
ob_flush();
flush();
ob_flush();
?>

go figure!
===============================================================================

Also note that any data in the buffer will flush at the end of the script, not
destroyed, so it is often not necessary to call ob_flush(); for example:

<?php
ob_start();
echo 'Hello World!'
?>

Will still result in Hello World! being displayed to the browser.

===============================================================================

Sockets should be first shutdown and then closed.
<?php
// Sample: Closing sockets gracefully
socket_shutdown($sock, 2);
socket_close($sock);
?>
===============================================================================

Shutdown and SOL_TCP:
<?php
$a= socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP);
socket_shutdown($a, 2)
?>
PHP Warning:  socket_shutdown(): unable to shutdown socket [107]: Transport
endpoint is not connected

Shutdown and SOL_UDP:
<?php
$a= socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_UDP);
socket_shutdown($a, 2)
?>
PHP Warning:  socket_shutdown(): unable to shutdown socket [107]: Transport
endpoint is not connected

Conclusion: if you are not actually connected, shutdown will fails with
socket_error = 107, Transport endpoint is not connected. This is true for both
TPC and UDP connection (which is suprising, UDP being a connectionless
protocol). This is true no matter the value set for the how parameter.
===============================================================================

That is not a good example of a graceful shutdown. One should close the sending
side of the socket and continue to read until the remote end closes its sending
connection.

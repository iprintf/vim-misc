(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

rawurldecode — 对已编码的 URL 字符串进行解码

说明

string rawurldecode ( string $str )

返回字符串，此字符串中百分号（%）后跟两位十六进制数的序列都将被替换成原义字符。

参数

str

    要解码的 URL。

返回值

返回解码后的 URL 字符串。

范例

Example #1 rawurldecode() 示例

<?php

echo rawurldecode('foo%20bar%40baz'); // foo bar@baz

?>

注释

    Note:

    rawurldecode() 不会把加号（'+'）解码为空格，而 urldecode() 可以。

Hi everybody =) My name is Javier and I'm from Argentina.
I've had a little issue with latin characters like ñ","Ñ","á","é","í", etc.
They are not decoded with rawurlencode(), so I've made this:
<?php
function urlRawDecode($raw_url_encoded)
{
    # Hex conversion table
    $hex_table = array(
        0 => 0x00,
        1 => 0x01,
        2 => 0x02,
        3 => 0x03,
        4 => 0x04,
        5 => 0x05,
        6 => 0x06,
        7 => 0x07,
        8 => 0x08,
        9 => 0x09,
        "A"=> 0x0a,
        "B"=> 0x0b,
        "C"=> 0x0c,
        "D"=> 0x0d,
        "E"=> 0x0e,
        "F"=> 0x0f
    );
       
    # Fixin' latin character problem
        if(preg_match_all("/\%C3\%([A-Z0-9]{2})/i", $raw_url_encoded,$res))
        {
            $res = array_unique($res = $res[1]);
            $arr_unicoded = array();
            foreach($res as $key => $value){
                $arr_unicoded[] = chr(
                        (0xc0 | ($hex_table[substr($value,0,1)]<<4))
                       | (0x03 & $hex_table[substr($value,1,1)])
                );
                $res[$key] = "%C3%" . $value;
            }

            $raw_url_encoded = str_replace(
                                    $res,
                                    $arr_unicoded,
                                    $raw_url_encoded
                        );
        }
       
        # Return decoded  raw url encoded data
        return rawurldecode($raw_url_encoded);
}

print urlRawDecode("%C3%A1%C3%B1");

// output:
// áñ

?>
For example, you have the character "ñ" encoded like this "%C3%B1".
This is nothing more and nothing less than 0xc3 and 0xb1,
they are binary numbers, (HHHH LLLL, where HHHH=High and LLLL=Low).
0xc3 = 1100 0011 (binary 8 bit word), 0xb1 = 1011 0001 (binary 8 bit word),
To convert a raw encoded character to ascii we have to make boolean operations
between this two operands (0xc3 and 0xb1), boolean algebra were defined by
George 
Boole, we need to use them here. The first one we going to use is the
logical OR ("|" or "pipe") and logical AND ("&" or "and person").

A logical OR implies the following truth table:
a b (a OR b)
0 0     0
0 1     1   (a OR b or Both, a and b, must be true to get a true result)
1 0     1
1 1     1

A logical AND implies the following truth table:
a b (a AND b)
0 0     0
0 1     0  
1 0     0
1 1     1   (Both a AND b, must be true to get a true result)

So, here we have to make a logical OR with both 0xc3 and 0xb1 HIGH nibble,
a nibble is a half byte (4 bits), so we have to make a logical OR between
1100 (0xc) and 1011 (0xb), we going to get this: 1111 (0xf), then we have to
make
a logical AND between both LOW nibble, 0011 (0x3) and 0001 (0x1), we going to
get
this: 0001, so, if we want to see the final result, we have to put HIGH and LOW
nibble on his Byte position, like this: 1111 0001 (0xf1) and that is nothing
more and nothing less than "ñ" (to check this out, try the following: print(chr
(0xf1));).

This "<<" is a logical shift left, if we have this binary number 0001 (1) and
we make this:
0001 << 2 we'll get 0100 (4) right bits are filled with 0's.

<?php
# Conversion example %C3%B1 to ASCII (0x71)
print(
    chr(
        (0xc0|0x0b<<4) | (0x03&0x01)
    )
);

// Output will be:
// ñ

// 1100 0000 OR 1011 0000 = 1111 0000 (0xf0)
// 0000 0011 AND 0000 0001 = 0000 0001 (0x01)
// 1111 0000 OR 0000 0001 = 1111 0001 (0xf1)

?>

PS: I'm so sorry about my english, I know, is horrible :P

Be aware that rawurldecode does not warn you in any way if the output is
nonvalid UTF-8.
For example if the input passed to the function is just "%C5", then since C is
1100 in binary, and UTF-8 characters starting with 110 should be followed by
another character, the result of rawurldecode will be just a single byte (with
value \xC5) which is not a correct UTF-8.
Confront this with for example Javascript which will warn you about it:

JAVASCRIPT:

decodeURI("%C5")
URIError: URI malformed

decodeURIComponent("%C5")
URIError: URI malformed

unescape("%C5")
"Å"

PHP:
var_dump(rawurldecode("%C5"))
string(1) "▒"

To sum it up: the only difference of this function to the urldecode function is
that the "+" character won't get translated.

{
    # Hex conversion table
    $hex_table = array(

        "D"=> 0x0d,
        "E"=> 0x0e,
        "F"=> 0x0f
    );
       
    # Fixin' latin character problem
        if(preg_match_all("/\%C3\%([A-Z0-9]{2})/i", $raw_url_encoded,$res))
        {
            $res = array_unique($res = $res[1]);
            $arr_unicoded = array();
            foreach($res as $key => $value){
                $arr_unicoded[] = chr(
                        (0xc0 | ($hex_table[substr($value,0,1)]<<4))
                       | (0x03 & $hex_table[substr($value,1,1)])
                );
                $res[$key] = "%C3%" . $value;
            }

            $raw_url_encoded = str_replace(
                                    $res,
                                    $arr_unicoded,
                                    $raw_url_encoded
                        );
        }
       
        # Return decoded  raw url encoded data
        return rawurldecode($raw_url_encoded);
}

print urlRawDecode("%C3%A1%C3%B1");

// output:
// áñ

?>
For example, you have the character "ñ" encoded like this "%C3%B1".
This is nothing more and nothing less than 0xc3 and 0xb1,
they are binary numbers, (HHHH LLLL, where HHHH=High and LLLL=Low).
0xc3 = 1100 0011 (binary 8 bit word), 0xb1 = 1011 0001 (binary 8 bit word),
To convert a raw encoded character to ascii we have to make boolean operations
between this two operands (0xc3 and 0xb1), boolean algebra were defined by
George 
Boole, we need to use them here. The first one we going to use is the
logical OR ("|" or "pipe") and logical AND ("&" or "and person").

A logical OR implies the following truth table:
a b (a OR b)
0 0     0
0 1     1   (a OR b or Both, a and b, must be true to get a true result)
1 0     1
1 1     1

A logical AND implies the following truth table:
a b (a AND b)
0 0     0
0 1     0  
1 0     0
1 1     1   (Both a AND b, must be true to get a true result)

So, here we have to make a logical OR with both 0xc3 and 0xb1 HIGH nibble,
a nibble is a half byte (4 bits), so we have to make a logical OR between
1100 (0xc) and 1011 (0xb), we going to get this: 1111 (0xf), then we have to
make
a logical AND between both LOW nibble, 0011 (0x3) and 0001 (0x1), we going to
get
this: 0001, so, if we want to see the final result, we have to put HIGH and LOW
nibble on his Byte position, like this: 1111 0001 (0xf1) and that is nothing
more and nothing less than "ñ" (to check this out, try the following: print(chr
(0xf1));).

This "<<" is a logical shift left, if we have this binary number 0001 (1) and
we make this:
0001 << 2 we'll get 0100 (4) right bits are filled with 0's.

<?php
# Conversion example %C3%B1 to ASCII (0x71)
print(
    chr(
        (0xc0|0x0b<<4) | (0x03&0x01)
    )
);

// Output will be:
// ñ

// 1100 0000 OR 1011 0000 = 1111 0000 (0xf0)
// 0000 0011 AND 0000 0001 = 0000 0001 (0x01)
// 1111 0000 OR 0000 0001 = 1111 0001 (0xf1)

?>

Let's say you pass some data between the client and the server in a more or
less array-like structure.

If using the [] brackets in the field names is not enough (or won't comply with
the rest of the project for some reason), you might have to use a string with a
number of different delimiters (rows, fields, rows inside fields and such).

To make sure that the data doesn't get mistaken for delimiters, you can use the
encodeURIComponent() JavaScript function. It pairs nicely with rawurldecode().

Once the string passed to the server side finally gets exploded into an array
(or set of such), you could use the following function to recursively
rawurldecode the array(s):

<?php

function rawurldecode_array(&$arr)
{
    foreach (array_keys($arr) as $key)
    {
        if (is_array($arr[$key]))
        {
            rawurldecode_array($arr[$key]);
        }
        else
        {
            $arr[$key] = rawurldecode($arr[$key]);
        }
    }
}

$a[0] = rawurlencode("2+1:3?9");
$a["k"] = rawurlencode("@:-/");
$a[-3][0] = rawurlencode("+");
$a[-3][2] = rawurlencode("=_~");
$a[-3]["a"] = rawurlencode("this+is a%test");

echo "<pre>"; print_r($a); echo "</pre>";

rawurldecode_array($a);

echo "<pre>"; print_r($a); echo "</pre>";

?>

The program will output:

Array
(
    [0] => 2%2B1%3A3%3F9
    [k] => %40%3A-%2F
    [-3] => Array
        (
            [0] => %2B
            [2] => %3D_%7E
            [a] => this%2Bis%20a%25test
        )

)

Array
(
    [0] => 2+1:3?9
    [k] => @:-/
    [-3] => Array
        (
            [0] => +
            [2] => =_~
            [a] => this+is a%test
        )

)
===============================================================================

Please note that the combination encodeURIComponent (Javascript) and
rawurldecode (PHP) only works well if magic quotes are turned off in php.ini
(magic_quotes_gpc = Off)

according to http://www.sphinxsearch.com/forum/view.html?id=5225:

this function doesn't really do what one would expect (mysql_real_escape_string
style) and is more meant to escape individual keywords...

my experience it works better to manually escape reserved characters, for
example:

<?php
$string='make big $ online';

$escaped=str_replace('$','\\$',$string);
?>

pg_escape_string

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_escape_string — 转义 text/char 类型的字符串

说明

string pg_escape_string ( string $data )

pg_escape_string() 转义 text/char 数据类型的字符串，返回转义后的字符串。建议用
此函数替代 addslashes()。

    Note:

    本函数需要 PostgreSQL 7.2 或以上版本。

===============================================================================

Forthose curious, the exact escaping performed on the string may vary slightly
depending on your database configuration.

For example, if your database's standard_conforming_strings variable is OFF,
backslashes are treated as a special character and pg_escape_string() will
ensure they are properly escaped.  If this variable is ON, backslashes will be
treated as ordinary characters, and pg_escape_string() will leave them as-is. 
In either case, the behavior matches the configuration of the database
connection.
===============================================================================

If your database is a UTF-8 database, you will run into problems trying to add
some data into your database...

for securty issues and/or compatability you may need to use the: utf_encode() (
http://php.net/utf8-encode) function.

for example:
<?php
$my_data = pg_escape_string(utf8_encode($_POST['my_data']));
?>
===============================================================================

pg_escape_string() won't cast array arguments to the "Array" string like php
usually does; it returns NULL instead. The following statements all evaluate to
true:

<?php
$a = array('foo', 'bar');

"$a" == 'Array';
(string)$a == 'Array';
$a . '' == 'Array';

is_null(pg_escape_string($a));
?>
===============================================================================

Since php 5.1 the new function pg_query_params() was introduced. With this
function you can use bind variables and don't have to escape strings. If you
can use it, do so. If unsure why, check the changelog for Postgres 8.0.8.
===============================================================================

You should prefer to use pg_query_params, i.e. use parameterized queries,
rather than using pg_escape_string. Or use the newer PDO interface with its
parameterized query support.

If you must substitute values directly, e.g. in DDL commands that don't support
execution as parameterized queries, do so with pg_escape_literal:

http://au1.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-escape-literal.php

Identifiers can't be used as query parameters. Always use pg_escape_identifier
for these if they're substituted dynamically:

http://au1.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-escape-identifier.php

You should not need to change text encodings when using this function. Make
sure your connection's client_encoding is set to the text encoding used by PHP,
and the PostgreSQL client driver will take care of text encodings for you. No
explicit utf-8 conversions should be necessary with a correctly set 
client_encoding.
===============================================================================

Creating a double-tick is just fine. It works the same as the backslash-tick
syntax. From the PostgreSQL docs:

The fact that string constants are bound by single quotes presents an obvious
semantic problem, however, in that if the sequence itself contains a single
quote, the literal bounds of the constant are made ambiguous. To escape (make
literal) a single quote within the string, you may type two adjacent single
quotes. The parser will interpret the two adjacent single quotes within the
string constant as a single, literal single quote. PostgreSQL will also allow
single quotes to be embedded by using a C-style backslash.
===============================================================================

Security methods which you use depend on the specific purpose. For those who
dont know, take a look at the following built-in PHP functions:

strip_tags()            to remove HTML characters
(also see htmlspecialchars)

escapeshellarg()      to escape shell commands etc
escapeshellcmd()

mysql_real_escape_string()     to escape mySQL commands.

Enjoy!

For those who escape their single quotes with a backslash (ie \') instead of
two single quotes in a row (ie '') there has recently been a SERIOUS sql
injection vulnerability that can be employed taking advantage of your chosen
escaping method.  More info here: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.50
Even after the postgre update, you may still be limited to what you can do with
your queries if you still insist on backslash escaping. It's a lesson to always
use the PHP functions to do proper escaping instead of adhoc addslashes or
magic quotes escaping.
===============================================================================

This may seem obvious, but remember that pg_escape_string escapes values for
use as string literals in an SQL query -- if you need to escape arbitrary
strings for use as SQL identifiers (column names, etc.), there doesn't seem to
be a PHP function for that so you'll have to do that escaping yourself. 
(PostgreSQL has an in-database function, quote_ident(), that does this.)

This can be an issue if your database contains mixed-case (or otherwise
unusual) column names and you have a class interface managing your database/
query interactions (for connecting to different types of databases).  If you
don't double-quote your column names then postgreSQL will match them
case-insensitively, but will label the results in all-lowercase (which differs
from MySQL).

For example:

<?php
// Plain column identifier
$res = pg_query("Select columnName from table");
$row = pg_fetch_assoc($res);

var_dump($row['columnName']); // Doesn't work (throws E_NOTICE)
var_dump($row['columnname']); // Works

// Escaped column identifier
$res = pg_query("Select \"columnName\" from table");
$row = pg_fetch_assoc($res);

var_dump($row['columnName']); // Works
var_dump($row['columnname']); // Doesn't
?>

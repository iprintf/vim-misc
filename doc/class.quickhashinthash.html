The QuickHashIntHash class

(PECL quickhash >= Unknown)

简介

This class wraps around a hash containing integer numbers, where the values are
also integer numbers. Hashes are also available as implementation of the
ArrayAccess interface.

Hashes can also be iterated over with foreach as the Iterator interface is
implemented as well. The order of which elements are returned in is not
guaranteed.

预定义常量

QuickHashIntHash::CHECK_FOR_DUPES

    If enabled, adding duplicate elements to a set (through either add() or
    loadFromFile()) will result in those elements to be dropped from the set.
    This will take up extra time, so only used when it is required.

QuickHashIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC

    Disables the use of PHP's internal memory manager for internal set
    structures. With this option enabled, internal allocations will not count
    towards the memory_limit settings.

QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_NO_HASH

    Selects to not use a hashing function, but merely use a modulo to find the
    bucket list index. This is not faster than normal hashing, and gives more
    collisions.

QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_JENKINS1

    This is the default hashing function to turn the integer hashes into bucket
    list indexes.

QuickHashIntHash::HASHER_JENKINS2

    Selects a variant hashing algorithm.

Detecting if another copy of a program is running (*NIX specific)

One cute trick, to see if another process is running, is to send it signal 0. 
Signal 0 does not actually get sent, but kill will check to see if it is
possible to send the signal.  Note that this only works if you have permission
to send a signal to that process.

A practical use for this technique is to avoid running multiple copies of the
same program.  You save the PID to a file in the usual way...   Then during
start-up you check the value of the PID file and see if that process currently
exists.

This is not totally fool-proof.  In rare circumstances it is possible for an
unrelated program to have the same recycled PID.  But that other program would
most likely not accept signals from your program anyway (unless your program is
root). 

To make it as reliable as possible, you would want your program to remove it's
PID file during shutdown (see register_shutdown_function).  That way, only if
your program crashed AND another program happened to use the same PID AND the
other program was willing to accept signals from your program, would you get a
wrong result.  This would be an exceedingly rare occurrence.  This also assumes
that the PID file has not been tampered with (as do all programs that rely on
PID files...). 

It's also possible to use 'ps x' to detect this, but using kill is much more
efficient.

Here is the core routine:

    $PrevPid = file_get_contents($PathToPidFile);

    if(($PrevPid !== FALSE) && posix_kill(rtrim($PrevPid),0)) {
        echo "Error: Server is already running with PID: $PrevPid\n";
        exit(-99);
    } else {
        echo "Starting Server...";
    }

Hmmm...  if you want total 100% reliability, plus efficiency.  What you could
do is to make the initial check using kill.  If it says not running, then you
are ready to zoom.  But if kill says already running, then you could use:

//You can get the $ProgramName from $argv[0]
$Result = shell_exec('ps x | grep "' . $PrevPid . '" | grep "' . $ProgramName .
'" | grep -v "grep"');

Assuming that your program has permissions to do this.  If you execute that and
get back an empty string, then the other program is an imposter using a
recycled PID and you are clear to go.

here is a process kill function for windows:

<?php
function win_kill($pid){
    $wmi=new COM("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\cimv2"
);
    $procs=$wmi->ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE ProcessId='".$pid
."'");
    foreach($procs as $proc)
      $proc->Terminate();
}
?>
===============================================================================

Warning!

The $sig parameter cannot be one of the PCNTL signals constants if you are
running your script from the browser (ie. as an apache process). Strangely it
does seem to allow the constants to be used from the command line ("php -r
...") but if your script is running from within apache then calling posix_kill
($pid, SIGINT) will return FALSE (and posix_get_last_error() will return 0).
===============================================================================

In order to check the outcome of posix_kill() you can use posix_get_last_error
(), which will return 0 (zero) in case of success and a non-zero error code
otherwise. Use the number returned by posix_get_last_error() as a parameter to
posix_strerror() to get a human-readable error message corresponding to that
error code.

Please note that a non-zero code from posix_get_last_error() does NOT mean that
the pid doesn't exist; it only means that posix_kill() ran into trouble
signalling that process. For example, the pid may exist but the process is
owned by a user other than the one you use to run the code, and you're not
root; in which case you'll get an error saying you're not allowed to signal
that process (operation not permitted).

Accordingly, the code posted by Jille earlier is WRONG. According to the POSIX
spec (see errno.h on your system), EPERM means "operation not permitted". This
should NOT be taken as indication that the pid doesn't exist, it merely means
that posix_kill() couldn't signal that process. If anything, it should be a
hint that a process with that pid IS running.

errno.h constant names definitions:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/errno.h.html

Unfortunately, PHP does not currently define constants with these names (such
as EPERM, ENOENT, ESRCH etc.) A non-complete subset is defined for socket
operations (SOCKET_EPERM for example), but it doesn't hold all the possible
POSIX error constants; ESRCH for instance is of particular interest for
posix_kill(), but SOCKET_ESRCH doesn't exist, because it means "no such
process" and doesn't make sense for sockets.

Solutions:
* Have PHP devs define these constants in a future PHP version.
* Look-up errno.h on your system and define your own constants. You can use a
script to parse errno.h and either define the constants on the fly or generate,
once, the PHP code to define them.

Please be advised, however, that relying on a specific errno.h is not portable.
Different systems may have different numeric values for these constants. That's
why PHP should be defining the constants at compilation time and the code
should be able to rely on the constant names; only the names are portable, not
the actual values.

check whether the process is running. windows-linux
<?php
function isRunning($pid) {
        $isRunning = false;
        if(strncasecmp(PHP_OS, "win", 3) == 0) {
            $out = [];
            exec("TASKLIST /FO LIST /FI \"PID eq $pid\"", $out);
            if(count($out) > 1) {
                $isRunning = true;
            }
        }
        elseif(posix_kill(intval($prevPid), 0)) {
            $isRunning = true;
        }
        return $isRunning;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Just like the error codes (EPERM, EEXIST, etc), signal numbers are different on
different platforms.  EG on macos, SIGCONT is 19; on Linux SIGSTOP is 19.  Big
difference.

If you have PCNTL compiled in, you can use the constants like SIGCONT; i trust
they're all correct.

If not, look in /usr/include/signal.h; these days its tons of ifdef mumbo jumbo
but you can go to /usr/include/bits or /usr/include/sys or something and look
for files named sig*.h; one of them will list them for you.
===============================================================================

Keep in mind that you can only send kill signals to processes owned by your
UID.

If you are running your program as root, then you can send kill signals to all
processes.
===============================================================================

For those that want to kill everything matching a certain pattern (ala killall
in for linux), try something like this.  Note that this is a good idea to do
something like this for cross platform compatilibity, instead of executing
killall, because killall for other UNIXes does just that, kills EVERYTHING.  :)

function killall($match) {
    if($match=='') return 'no pattern specified';
    $match = escapeshellarg($match);
    exec("ps x|grep $match|grep -v grep|awk '{print $1}'", $output, $ret);
    if($ret) return 'you need ps, grep, and awk installed for this to work';
    while(list(,$t) = each($output)) {
        if(preg_match('/^([0-9]+)/', $t, $r)) {
            system('kill '. $r[1], $k);
            if(!$k) $killed = 1;
        }
    }
    if($killed) {
        return '';
    } else {
        return "$match: no process killed";
    }
}
===============================================================================

Posix_kill is not so reliable (it seems it always deliver the signal - even 0
to a no existing process - and doesn't generate an error).
I found this way to check the existence of a process, using /proc:

if(!file_exists("/proc/$pid/cmdline"

obviously check the permissions .
===============================================================================

If you want to test whether processes owned by other users are running, you can
use:

<?php
  $running=posix_kill($pid, 0);
  if(posix_get_last_error()==1) /* EPERM */
    $running=true;
?>

If the process is owned by somebody else (and you're not root), you will get an
EPERM.
On my system (FreeBSD) this is defined to 1.

You should test what the value of EPERM is on your system.
===============================================================================

A little recursive function to kill a process and his childs.
it works fine for me and I don't have find something else to do it.
It's a mix of various scripts I've found.

<?php
    function killProcessAndChilds($pid,$signal) {
        exec("ps -ef| awk '\$3 == '$pid' { print  \$2 }'", $output, $ret);
        if($ret) return 'you need ps, grep, and awk';
        while(list(,$t) = each($output)) {
            if ( $t != $pid ) {
                killProcessAndChilds($t,$signal);
            }
        }
        //echo "killing ".$pid."\n";
        posix_kill($pid, 9);
    }
?>

pg_query

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_query — 执行查询

说明

resource pg_query ( resource $connection , string $query )

pg_query() 在查询可以执行时返回查询结果资源号。如果查询失败或者提供的连接号无效
则返回 FALSE。如果连接号有效，则可以用 pg_last_error() 函数来提取详细的错误信息
。pg_query() 发送一条 SQL 语句到 connection 资源指定的 PostgreSQL 数据库。
connection 必须是由 pg_connect() 或 pg_pconnect() 返回的合法连接号。本函数返回
值是一个其它 PostgreSQL 函数例如 pg_fetch_array() 可以用来访问查询结果的查询结
果资源号。


    Note: connection 是 pg_query() 中的可选参数。如果没有指定 connection，则使
    用默认连接。默认连接是 pg_connect() 或 pg_pconnect() 所打开的最后一个连接。
    尽管 connection 参数可以省略，但不推荐这样做。因为这样可能会导致很难发现脚
    本中的错误。

    Note:

    本函数以前的名字为 pg_exec()。pg_exec() 函数为了兼容性的原因仍然可以使用，
    但是鼓励用户使用新的名字。

参见 pg_connect()，pg_pconnect()，pg_fetch_array()，pg_fetch_object()，
pg_num_rows() 和 pg_affected_rows()。

Regarding david.bouriaud@ac-rouen.fr:
You misunderstand SQL. When a query is issued, results applicable at the time
of the query are returned to the application (i.e. PHP). There is no further
reference to the database required. Thus, all of the pg_fetch_* functions are
acting on an internal data storage, NOT the database itself. This is because
SQL does not have a concept of sets, or of state (except in limited
circumstances provided by transactions). However, if you use a cursor instead,
fetching only one record at a time, you may get an error if you delete the
table. If you don't, it is an issue with Postgres, not PHP.
===============================================================================

A quick note for novice users: when gathering input from fields on a web form
that maintains a database connection, *never* use pg_query to do queries from
the field. Always sanitize input using pg_prepare and pg_execute.
===============================================================================

Use pg_query to call your stored procedures, and use pg_fetch_result when
getting a value (like a smallint as in this example) returned by your stored
procedure.

<?php
$pgConnection = pg_connect("dbname=users user=me");

$userNameToCheckFor = "metal";

$result = pg_query($pgConnection, "SELECT howManyUsersHaveThisName('
$userNameToCheckFor')");

$count = pg_fetch_result($result, 0, 'howManyUsersHaveThisName');
?>
===============================================================================

There was a typo in the code that I posted:

<?php
  $result=pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM x WHERE a=b;");
  if  (!$result) {
   echo "query did not execute";
  }
  if (pg_num_rows($result) == 0) {
   echo "0 records"
  }
  else {
   while ($row = pg_fetch_array($result)) {
     //do stuff with $row
   }
  }
?>
===============================================================================

$GLOBALS["PG_CONNECT"]=pg_connect(...);
....

function query ($sqlQuery,$var=0) {
   if (!$GLOBALS["PG_CONNECT"]) return 0;
   $lev=error_reporting (8); //NO WARRING!!
   $result=pg_query ($sqlQuery);
   error_reporting ($lev); //DEFAULT!!
   if (strlen ($r=pg_last_error ($GLOBALS["PG_CONNECT"]))) {
      if ($var) {
        echo "<p color=\"red\">ERROR:<pre>";
        echo $sqlQuery;
        echo "</pre>";
        echo $r;
        echo "&lt/p>";
      }
      close_db ();
      return 0;
   }
   return $result;
}

In reply to david dot bouriaud at ac-rouen dot fr:

All it is doing is internal caching. How can that be dangerous. If you are
going to be deleting records after you have closed the connection it is your
problem to make sure you have the latest and greatest records, and not some
cached ones. Considering you are writing the script I don't see why it is a
problem, you know what you are doing in the script, so it is quite useless for
PHP to invalidate the cache, when that could be done upon exiting the script,
which would mean there was less time spent cleaning out the cache when it
counts most (when returning data to the user).
===============================================================================

Improving upon what jsuzuki said:

It's probably better to use pg_num_rows() to see if no rows were returned, as
that leaves the resultset cursor pointed to the first row so you can use it in
a loop.

Example:

<?php
  $result=pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM x WHERE a=b;");
  if  (!$result) {
   echo "query did not execute";
  }
  if (pg_num_rows($result) == 0) {
   echo "0 records"
  }
  else {
    while ($row = pg_fetch_array($result) {
      //do stuff with $row
    }
  }
?>

I, personally, also find it more readable.
===============================================================================

It would be better this way:

<?php
  $result=pg_query($conn, "SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows FROM x WHERE a=b;");
  if  (!$result) {
   echo "query did not execute";
  }
  if ($line = pg_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    if ($line['rows'] == 0) {
     echo "0 records"
    }
  }
  else {
   while ($row = pg_fetch_array($result)) {
     //do stuff with $row
   }
  }
?>

This solution doesn't raise the load of the system with the move of matching
rows (perhaps 0,1, perhaps 100, 1000, ... rows)
===============================================================================

expanding on the note left by "cmoore" -

To check to see if the recordset returned no records,

<?php
  $result=pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM x WHERE a=b;");
  if  (!$result) {
    echo "query did not execute";
  }
  $rs = pg_fetch_assoc($result);
  if (!$rs) {
    echo "0 records"
  }
?>

Here is my small function to make it easier for me to use data from select
queries (attention, it is sensitive to sql injection)
<?php
function requestToDB($connection,$request){
    if(!$result=pg_query($connection,$request)){
        return False;
    }
    $combined=array();
    while ($row = pg_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        $combined[]=$row;
    }
    return $combined;
}
?>

Example:
<?php
$conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=mydatabase");

$results=requestToDB($connect,"select * from mytable");

//You can now access a "cell" of your table like this:
$rownumber=0;
$columname="mycolumn";

$mycell=$results[$rownumber][$columname];
var_dump($mycell);
===============================================================================

One thing to note that wasn't obvious to me at first.  If your query returns
zero rows, that is not a "failed" query.  So the following is wrong:
  $result=pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM x WHERE a=b;");
  if  (!$result) {
    echo "No a=b in x\n";
  }

pg_query returns FALSE if the query can not be executed for some reason.  If
the query is executed but returns zero rows then you get back a resul with no
rows.
===============================================================================

Took me a while to track this down so I thought it might be useful for others:

If you use stored procedures and need to get result sets back from them:

function dbquery($link,$query){
  pg_query($link,"BEGIN;");
  $tr=pg_query($link,$query);
  $r=pg_fetch_row($tr);
  $name=$r[0];
  $rs=pg_query($link,"FETCH ALL IN \"" . $name . "\";");
  pg_query($link,"END;");
  return $rs;
}

(Error checking removed for clarity)
===============================================================================

create table from pg_query results.. hope it helps newbies...
function table_create($result)
{
    $numrows = pg_num_rows($result);
    $fnum = pg_num_fields($result);

    echo "<table border width='100%'>";
    echo "<tr>";

    for ($x = 0; $x < $fnum; $x++) {
        echo "<td><b>";
        echo strtoupper(pg_field_name($result, $x));
        echo "</b></td>";
    }

    echo "</tr>";

    for ($i = 0; $i < $numrows; $i++) {
        $row = pg_fetch_object($result, $i);
        echo "<tr align='center'>";
        for ($x = 0; $x < $fnum; $x++) {
    $fieldname = pg_field_name($result, $x);
    echo "<td>";
    echo $row->$fieldname;
    echo "</td>";
        }
        echo"</tr>";
    }
    echo "</table>";
   
    return 0;
}
===============================================================================

That's why your code should never assume it has the very latest data unless it
locks it.

Hi to all !
It seems that the old pg_exec function does not do what it is expected to.
In the doc, it is said that it returns a resource identifier on the successful
querry that was send to the backend.
It seems to me that it is more than a resource identifier.
Follow the example :

<?php
$ConnId = pg_connect ("blablabla");
$ResId = pg_exec ("select * from table", $ConnId);
pg_close ($ConnId);
$row = pg_fetch_array ($ResId, 4);
?>

I closed the connection voluntarily before the pg_fetch_array. It WORKS !

Now, imagine the following script :
<?php
$ConnId = pg_connect ("blablabla");
$ResId = pg_exec ("select * from table", $ConnId);
pg_close ($ConnId);
system ("psql base -c delete from table");
$row = pg_fetch_array ($ResId, 4);
?>
See how it could be harmful !!!! I think that the coders have done this for
performances reasons, but it is not the right way do do so !!!

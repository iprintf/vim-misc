The RarArchive class

(PECL rar >= 2.0.0)

简介

This class represents a RAR archive, which may be formed by several volumes
(parts) and which contains a number of RAR entries (i.e., files, directories
and other special objects such as symbolic links).

Objects of this class can be traversed, yielding the entries stored in the
respective RAR archive. Those entries can also be obtained through 
RarArchive::getEntry() and RarArchive::getEntries().

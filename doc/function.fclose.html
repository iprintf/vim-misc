In case you have some trouble to properly disconnect some client streams opened
with stream_socket_server / stream_select you should give a try to
stream_socket_shutdown.

<?php stream_socket_shutdown($clientStream,STREAM_SHUT_RDWR); ?>
===============================================================================

if you want to daysychain a filehandle through some functions and each function
is allowed to close th file you might look in a following function first, if
the handle is still valid.

Opening a file, there often will be used a code like

if (!$fh = fopen($filename, $mode)) return false;

But if you possably have closed the file and you want to check that, a smililar
statement would not work.

DOES NOT WORK:   if (!$fh)  end_of_chain();

use beter: if (is_resource($fh))   end_of_chain();
===============================================================================

It is a GOOD_THING to check the return value from fclose(), as some operating
systems only flush file output on close, and can, therefore, return an error
from fclose(). You can catch severe data-eating errors by doing this.

I learned this the hard way.

In response to kumar mcmillan 'gotcha' note below, we get a different result on
a W2K machine:

<?php
$file_pointer = fopen('textfile.dat', 'r');
fclose($file_pointer);
echo '$file_pointer is resource = ' . (is_resource($file_pointer) ? 'true': 
'false');
?>

output:
$file_pointer is resource = false
===============================================================================

Do not forget, if you are going to read the contents of the file which you have
already written via fwrite() or else you have to close the file first.
===============================================================================

It is very important to make sure you clear any incoming packets out of the
incoming buffer using fread() or some equivalent.  Although you can call fclose
() the socket does not actually shut down until the inbound packets have been
cleared.  This can lead to some confusion.
===============================================================================

Generally, it's always a good idea to close a file when you're done with it.
It's very easy for something to go wrong and corrupt a file that hasn't been
closed properly. If you're concerned about efficiency, the overhead is
negligible.
===============================================================================

fclose() also clears any locks on the file, so if another process was being
kept waiting for the lock to be cleared, fclose()ing will allow the other
process to continue.

[Another "just-in-case" reason to habitually fclose() all files as soon as
practical!]
===============================================================================

Note that since PHP 5.3.2 fclose() no longer unlock open file descriptors at
shutdown.
===============================================================================

gotcha:

<?php

$file_pointer = fopen('data.dat', 'r');
fclose($file_pointer);

echo '$file_pointer is resource = ' . (is_resource($file_pointer) ? 'true': 
'false');

?>

output:
$file_pointer is resource = true

Trying to understand how 'end foreach' and 'endwhile' differ, I've encountered
a problem I can't solve by myself. The following is a fairly easy stock
portfolio script. Everything works, except at the end where I want to calculate
the average of the gains as represented by $gain[$i].

<?php
$quantity="3";
$stocks=array("iso","grn","bdgr.pk");
$buydates=array("3 jan 2006","1 feb 2006","3 apr 2006");
$prices=array("0.32","0.20","0.95");
$recommends=array("hold","strong buy","buy");
$i=0;
echo"<tr>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>ticker</th>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>buy date</th>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>price $</th>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>recommend</th>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>value $</th>";
echo "\n<th align='center'>change %</th>\n</tr>\n";
foreach($stocks as $stock) {
$fp=fopen("http://","r");
$data=fgetcsv($fp,1000,",");
$values=$data[1];
echo "<tr>\n<td align='center'>".$stock."</td>";
echo "\n<td align='center'>".$buydates[$i]."</td>";
echo "\n<td align='center'>".$prices[$i]."</td>";
echo "\n<td align='center'>".$recommends[$i]."</td>";
echo "\n<td align='center'>".$values."</td>\n<td align='center'>";
echo $gain[$i]=round(((($values-$prices[$i])/$prices[$i])*100),2);
echo "</td>\n</tr>";
fclose ($fp);
$i++;
}
echo "\n<tr>\n<td align='center'>".$gain[$i]."<td>\n</tr>\n";
?>

Help?

It really behaves like `include` and will only resolve the filename against the
include-path, if the path is relative. It makes not much sense to resolve
already absolute pathnames anyway.

In case you're running a version of PHP that doesn't have this function...

if (!function_exists('stream_resolve_include_path')) {
    /**
     * Resolve filename against the include path.
     *
     * stream_resolve_include_path was introduced in PHP 5.3.2. This is kinda a
PHP_Compat layer for those not using that version.
     *
     * @param Integer $length
     * @return String
     * @access public
     */
    function stream_resolve_include_path($filename)
    {
        $paths = PATH_SEPARATOR == ':' ?
            preg_split('#(?<!phar):#', get_include_path()) :
            explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, get_include_path());
        foreach ($paths as $prefix) {
            $ds = substr($prefix, -1) == DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR ? '' :
DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
            $file = $prefix . $ds . $filename;

            if (file_exists($file)) {
                return $file;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}

stream_resolve_include_path() seems to cache it's output. After I renamed a
file, I had to restart Apache for stream_resolve_include_path() to not return
non-existing file name. This was on Windows.

This seems to be a great alternative to file_exists.

if( file_exists(__DIR__.'/som-file.php') )

Goes way slower than:

if( stream_resolve_inlcude_path(__DIR__.'/som-file.php') !== false)

pcntl_signal

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pcntl_signal — 安装一个信号处理器

说明

bool pcntl_signal ( int $signo , callback $handler [, bool $restart_syscalls =
true ] )

函数pcntl_signal()为signo指定的信号安装一个新的信号处理器。

参数

signo

    信号编号。

handler

    信号处理器可以是用户创建的函数或方法的名字，也可以是系统常量 SIG_IGN（译注
    ：忽略信号处理程序）或SIG_DFL（默认信号处理程序）.

        Note:

        注意当你使用一个对象方法的时候，该对象的引用计数回增加使得它在你改变为
        其他处理或脚本结束之前是持久存在的。

restart_syscalls

    指定当信号到达时系统调用重启是否可用。（译注：经查资料，此参数意为系统调用
    被信号打断时，系统调用是否从开始处重新开始，但根据http://bugs.php.net/
    bug.php?id=52121，此参数存在bug无效。）

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
4.3.0 增加参数restart_syscalls。
4.3.0 对象方法可以作为回调被使用。
      PCNTL现在使用了ticks作为信号处理的回调机制，ticks在速度上远远超过了之前的
      处理机制。这个变化与“用户ticks”遵循了相同的语义。您可以使用declare() 语句
      在程序中指定允许发生回调的位置。这使得我们对异步事件处理的开销最小化。在
4.3.0 编译PHP时启用pcntl将始终承担这种开销，不论您的脚本中是否真正使用了pcntl。
      PHP 4.3.0使用ticks作为信号处理回调机制，这比以前的机制快了很多。这个变化
      与 "用户ticks" 遵循了相同的语义。您可以使用declare() 语句在程序中指定允许
      发生回调的位置。

范例

Example #1 pcntl_signal()示例

<?php
//使用ticks需要PHP 4.3.0以上版本

         case SIGTERM:
             // 处理SIGTERM信号
             exit;
             break;
         case SIGHUP:
             //处理SIGHUP信号
             break;
         case SIGUSR1:
             echo "Caught SIGUSR1...\n";
             break;
         default:
             // 处理所有其他信号
     }

}

echo "Generating signal SIGTERM to self...\n";

//向当前进程发送SIGUSR1信号
posix_kill(posix_getpid(), SIGUSR1);

echo "Done\n"

Remember that declaring a tick handler can become really expensive in terms of
CPU cycles: Every n ticks the signal handling overhead will be executed.

So instead of declaring tick=1, test if tick=100 can do the job. If so, you are
likely to gain fivefold speed.

As your script might always might miss some signals due to blocking operations
like cURL downloads, call pcntl_signal_dispatch() on vital spots, e.g. at the
beginning of your main loop.
===============================================================================

For PHP >= 5.3.0, instead of declare(ticks = 1), you should now use pcntl_
signal_ dispatch().
===============================================================================

You cannot assign a signal handler for SIGKILL (kill -9).
===============================================================================

Some weird signal interactions going on here. I'm running PHP 4.3.9.

sleep() calls seem to be interrupted when any signal is received by the PHP
script. But things get weird when you sleep() inside a signal handler.

Ordinarily, signal handlers are non-reentrant. That is, if the signal handler
is running, sending another signal has no effect. However, sleep() seems to
override PHP's signal handling. If you sleep() inside a signal handler, the
signal is received and the sleep() is interrupted.

This can be worked around like this:

function handler($signal)
{
    // Ignore this signal
    pcntl_signal($signal, SIG_IGN);

    sleep(10);

    // Reinstall signal handler
    pcntl_signal($signal, __FUNCTION__);
}

I don't see any mention of this behavior in the documentation.
===============================================================================

Tip: when using objects, don't set the signal handler from the constructor or
even a method called from the constructor - your internal variables will be
uninitialised.

I ran into an interesting problem. CLI 4.3.10 Linux

The parent forked a child.  The child did a bunch of stuff, and when it was
done it sent SIGUSR1 to the parent and immediately exited.

Result:
The child turned into a zombie process waiting for the parent to harvest it, as
it should.

But the parent was unable to harvest the child because it was receiving an
endless barrage of SIGUSR1s.  In fact, it logged over 200000 before I shut it
down (SIGKILL).  The parent was not able to do anything else (respond to other
events) during that time.

No, it wasn't a bug in my child code.  Apparently, after sending a signal there
is some "behind the covers" work that needs to occur to acknowledge signal
completion, and when you exit immediately it is not able to happen, so the
system just keeps trying.

Solution:  I introduced a small delay in the child, after sending the signal,
and before exiting. 
No more Sig loops...

----------

P.S.  With respect to the note below.  The whole point of the sleep function is
to enable the processing of other events.  So, yes, your non-renterent code,
will suddenly get re-entered when you do a sleep, because you have just handed
off control to the next pending event.

Ignoring the signal is only an option if the signal is unimportant to your
program....   The better way to approach it, is to not do lengthy processing
inside of the signal event.  Instead set a global flag and get the heck out of
there as fast as possible.  Allow another part of your program to check the
flag and do the processing outside of the signal event.  Usually your program
is in some kind of loop when it is receiving signals, so checking a flag
regularly shouldn't be a problem.
===============================================================================

Since php >= 5.3 handles Closures, you are now able to define the Callback
directly.
Try this:

<?php
declare(ticks = 1);

pcntl_signal(SIGUSR1, function ($signal) {
            echo 'HANDLE SIGNAL ' . $signal . PHP_EOL;
});

posix_kill(posix_getpid(), SIGUSR1);

die;
?>
===============================================================================

I was having some issues with processing a signal using an object method I use
for something else as well. In particular, I wanted to handle SIGCHLD with my
own method "do_reap()" which I also call after a stream_select timeout and that
uses a non-blocking pcntl_waitpid function.

The method was called when the signal was received but it couldn't reap the
child.

The only way it worked was by creating a new handler that itself called do_reap
().

So in other words, the following does not work:

<?php
class Parent {
  /* ... */
  private function do_reap(){
    $p = pcntl_waitpid(-1,$status,WNOHANG);
    if($p > 0){
      echo "\nReaped zombie child " . $p;
    }

   public function run(){
    /* ... */
    pcntl_signal(SIGCHLD,array(&$this,"do_reap"));
    $readable = @stream_select($read,$null,$null,5); // 5 sec timeout
    if($readable === 0){
      // we got a timeout
      $this->do_reap();
   }
}
?>

But this work:

<?php
class Parent {
  /* ... */
  private function do_reap(){
    $p = pcntl_waitpid(-1,$status,WNOHANG);
    if($p > 0){
      echo "\nReaped zombie child " . $p;
    }

   public function run(){
    /* ... */
    pcntl_signal(SIGCHLD,array(&$this,"child_died"));
    $readable = @stream_select($read,$null,$null,5); // 5 sec timeout
    if($readable === 0){
      // we got a timeout
      $this->do_reap();
   }

    private function child_died(){
      $this->do_reap();
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you have a script that needs certain sections to not be interrupted by a
signal (especially SIGTERM or SIGINT), but want to make your script ready to
process that signal ASAP, there's only one way to do it. Flag the script as
having received the signal, and wait for your script to say its ready to
process it.

Here's a sample script:

<?
    $allow_exit = true;  // are we permitting exit?
    $force_exit = false; // do we need to exit?

    declare(ticks = 1);
    register_tick_function('check_exit');
    pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, 'sig_handler');
    pcntl_signal(SIGINT, 'sig_handler');

    function sig_handler () {
        global $allow_exit, $force_exit;

        if ($allow_exit)
            exit;
        else
            $force_exit = true;
    }

    function check_exit () {
        global $allow_exit, $force_exit;

        if ($force_exit && $allow_exit)
            exit;
    }

    $allow_exit = false;

    $i = 0;
    while (++$i) {
        echo "still going (${i})\n";
        if ($i == 10)
            $allow_exit = true;

        sleep(2);
    }
?>

You set $allow_exit to true at all times when it is perfectly acceptable that
your script could exit without warning. In sections where you really need the
script to continue running, you set $allow_exit to false. Any signals received
while $allow_exit is false will not take effect until you set $allow_exit to
true.

<?
    $allow_exit = true;

    // unimportant stuff here. exiting will not harm anything

    $allow_exit = false;

    // really important stuff not to be interrupted

    $allow_exit = true;

    // more unimportant stuff. if signal was received during
    // important processing above, script will exit here
?>

There are two documents I consider reading:

  Unix Signals Programming
  http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/lupg/tutorials/

  Beej's Guide to Unix Interprocess Communication
  http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~beej/guide/ipc/

Also, have a look at the manpage:

A word of caution around the third parameter (restart_syscalls) in pcntl_signal
(...).

I kept having a repeated issue where (seemingly randomly) my script would "exit
unexpectedly" (_exit_, not crash: the exit code was always 0) while tracking
forked children using signal handlers.

It appears that the signal handling is not at fault (indeed, PHP isn't "at
fault").  Having "restart_syscalls" set to FALSE seemed to be the problem's
cause.

I haven't debugged the issue extensively - except to observe that the issue was
highly intermittent and seemed to relate to my use of usleep() in conjunction
with restart_syscalls=FALSE.

My theory is the usleep() was wrongly tracking time - as described over here:
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/restart_syscall.2.html

Long story short, I re-enabled (which is the default value) restart_syscalls,
and the issue went away.

If you're curious - register_shutdown_function was still being handled
correctly - so PHP definitely was _NOT_ crashing.  Interestingly however, my
procedural code never "resumed" after the signal was handled.

I do not believe this is a bug.  I believe it was ignorant user error.  YMMV.
===============================================================================

Looks like php uses  RealTime signals. This means that if one signal is
currently processed, then other signals will not be lost.

just for example
<?php
pcntl_signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN)
?>

in strace log looks like this

"rt_sigaction(SIGHUP, {SIG_IGN, [], SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, 0x7f8caf83cc30},
{SIG_DFL, [], 0}, 8) = 0"

And code for testing

<?php
pcntl_signal(SIGHUP, function($signo){
  echo "1\n";
  sleep(2);
  echo "2\n";
});

while(true){
  sleep(1);
  pcntl_signal_dispatch();
}
?>

Run this and send how many SIGHUP signals as you want. All of them will be
processed.

P.S.
I guess "all of them". I couldn't found real signal queue size. Will appreciate
if someone points me.
===============================================================================

<?php
pcntl_signal(SIGTERM,  function($signo) {
    echo "\n This signal is called. [$signo] \n";
    Status::$state = -1;
});

class Status{
    public static $state = 0;
}

$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
    die('could not fork');
}

if($pid) {
    // parent
} else {
    while(true) {
        // Dispatching...
        pcntl_signal_dispatch();
        if(Status::$state == -1) {
            // Do something and end loop.
            break;
        }
       
        for($j = 0; $j < 2; $j++) {
            echo '.';
            sleep(1);
        }
        echo "\n";
    }
   
    echo "Finish \n";
    exit();
}

$n = 0;
while(true) {
    $res = pcntl_waitpid($pid, $status, WNOHANG);
   
    // If the child process ends, then end the main process.
    if(-1 == $res || $res > 0)
        break;
   
    // Send a signal after 5 seconds..
    if($n == 5)
        posix_kill($pid, SIGTERM);
   
    $n++;
   
    sleep(1);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Please be aware that declaring ticks or calling pcntl_signal_dispatch() in 5.3
and later is required to make pcntl_signal do anything useful. I wish the
documentation made this more clear.
===============================================================================

static class method to get the name of a process signal as string:

(self::$processSignalDescriptions is used to cache the results)

<?php
    public static function getPOSIXSignalText($signo) {

        try {
            if (is_null(self::$processSignalDescriptions)) {

                self::$processSignalDescriptions = array();

                $signal_list = explode(" ", trim(shell_exec("kill -l")));
                foreach ($signal_list as $key => $value) {
                    self::$processSignalDescriptions[$key+1] = "SIG".$value;
                }
            }

            return isset(self::$processSignalDescriptions[$signo])?self::
$processSignalDescriptions[$signo]:"UNKNOWN";

        } catch (Exception $e) {}

        return "UNKNOWN";
    }
?>
===============================================================================

I found out then when you use pcntl_signal in a 'deamon' script and you run it
before you fork childs it does not work as expected.

instead you need to use pcntl_signal in the child code of the child you are
forking

and if you want to cach signals for the 'deamon' part you should use
pcntl_signal in the parent code.
===============================================================================

Be careful, when using an object in your callback. It seems this elevates the
reference count. You may not want it to happen in repeated child processes.
===============================================================================

Multiple children return less than the number of children exiting at a given
moment SIGCHLD signals is normal behavior for Unix (POSIX) systems.  SIGCHLD
might be read as "one or more children changed status -- go examine your
children and harvest their status values".  Signals are implemented as bit
masks in most Unix systems, so there can only be 1 SIGCHLD bit set in any given
kernel tick for a process.
===============================================================================

Under my setup (FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE / PHP 5.2.4 CLI) I've noticed that when a
child exits the SIGCHLD handler in the parent is not always invoked. It seems
to happen when two children exit near simultaneously.

In this instance the child prints "EXIT" and the parent prints "SIGCHLD
received":

- EXIT
- SIGCHLD received

This works as expected, but now look what happens when three exit in quick
succession:

- EXIT
- EXIT
- EXIT
- SIGCHLD received
- SIGCHLD received

Because of this quirk any code which tries to limit the maximum number of
children by incrementing on fork and decrementing on SIGCHLD will eventually
end up with a single child (or no further forks), since the "active children"
count is always above the maximum. I've noticed similar behaviour with using
decrement after pcntl_wait(). Hopefully there's a workaround for this.
===============================================================================

I have been having trouble reaping my child process. It seemed most of the
time, children were reaped properly but *sometimes* they would stay as zombies.
I was catching the CHLD signal to reap child processes with the following code:

<?php

function childFinished($signal)
{
  global $kids;
  $kids--;
  pcntl_waitpid(-1, $status);
}

$kids = 0;
pcntl_signal(SIGCHLD, "childFinished");
for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++)
{
  while ($kids >= 50) sleep(1);
 
  $pid = pcntl_fork();
  if ($pid == -1) die('failed to fork :(');

  /* child process */
  if ($pid == 0)
  {
    /* do something */
    exit(0);
  }

  /* parent */
  else { $kids++; }
}

/* when finished, just clean up the children */
print "Reaping $kids children...\n";
while ($kids) sleep(1);

print "Finished.\n";
?>

The problem was, $kids never became zero so it would effectively wait forever.
After wracking my brains (UNIX forks are new to me) I finally read the Perl IPC
docs and viola, a solution! It turns out that because signal handlers are not
re-entrant, my handler will not be called again while it is in use. The
scenario that caused me trouble was that one child would exit and call the
signal handler, which would pcntl_waitpid() it and decrement the counter.
Meanwhile, another child would exit while the first child was still being
reaped,  so the second would never get to notify the parent!

The solution was to continually reap children from the SIGCHLD handler, so long
as there were children to reap. Here is the *fixed* childFinished function:

<?php

function childFinished($signal)
{
  global $kids;

  while( pcntl_waitpid(-1, $status, WNOHANG) > 0 )
    $kids--;
}

?>
===============================================================================

This issue occurs in at least PHP 5.1.2.

When a SIGINT is sent via CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK, the handler is called. If this
handler sends a SIGTERM to other children, the signals are not received.

SIGINT can be sent via posix_kill() and it work exactly as expected-- This only
applies when initiated via a hard break.
===============================================================================

In at least version 5.1.4, the parameter passed to the handler is not a strict
integer.

I have had such problems as trying to add the signal to an array, but the array
is completely screwed up when viewed (but not viewed immediately after being
added). This occurs when the handler is a method (array($this, 'methodname')),
or a traditional functions.

To avoid this bug, typecast the parameter to an integer:
(note that each newline may appear to just be 'n'.)

<?php
print("pid= " . posix_getpid() . "\n");
declare(ticks=1);
$arrsignals = array();

function handler($nsig)
{
    global $arrsignals;
    $arrsignals[] = (int)$nsig;
    print("Signal caught and registered.\n");
    var_dump($arrsignals);
}

pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, 'handler');

// Wait for signals from the command-line (just a simple 'kill (pid)').
$n = 15;
while($n)
{
    sleep(1);
    $n--;
}

print("terminated.\n\n");
var_dump($arrsignals);
?>

Process handling is not available when using a blocking socket! Bear this in
mind.
===============================================================================

When you are running a script inside of a loop that checks a socket, and it
hangs on that checking (Either by flaw or design), it can't handle signals
until some data is received.

A suggested workaround would be to use the stream_set_blocking function, or
stream_select on the offending reads.
===============================================================================

you should use following code to prevent situation described by anxious2006
(children exit near simultaneously)

public function sig_handler($signo){
  switch ($signo) {
    case SIGCLD:
      while( ( $pid = pcntl_wait ( $signo, WNOHANG ) ) > 0 ){
        $signal = pcntl_wexitstatus ( $signo );
      }
      break;
  }
}

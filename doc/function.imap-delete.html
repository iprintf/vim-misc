imap_delete — Mark a message for deletion from current mailbox

说明

bool imap_delete ( resource $imap_stream , int $msg_number [, int $options = 0
] )

Marks messages listed in msg_number for deletion. Messages marked for deletion
will stay in the mailbox until either imap_expunge() is called or imap_close()
is called with the optional parameter CL_EXPUNGE.

参数

imap_stream

    由 imap_open() 返回的 IMAP 流。

msg_number

    The message number

options

    You can set the FT_UID which tells the function to treat the msg_number
    argument as an UID.

返回值

Returns TRUE.

范例

Example #1 imap_delete() example

<?php

$mbox = imap_open("{imap.example.org}INBOX", "username", "password")
    or die("Can't connect: " . imap_last_error());

$check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
echo "Messages before delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";

imap_delete($mbox, 1);

$check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
echo "Messages after  delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";

imap_expunge($mbox);

$check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
echo "Messages after expunge: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";

imap_close($mbox);
?>

注释

    Note:

    IMAP mailboxes may not have their message flags saved between connections,
    so imap_expunge() should be called during the same connection in order to
    guarantee that messages marked for deletion will actually be purged.

I had some major issues deleting emails using this function.  Using IIS 5.0 and
a win based Mail Server, I could not delete the emails individually.

My script merely needed to check the emails and update the database for bounce
backs, after which I simply wanted to erase all emails.

If imap_delete($mbox,$email->MsgNo) just isnt working for you, you can try
using

    imap_delete($mbox,'1:*');

to clear out an entire mailbox.

Hope this helps cause it drove me insane for about 5 hours.  :)

I couldn't get imap_delete to work when I used it with pop3. Instead i wrote:
<?php
function pop3_dele($connection,$message)
{
    $status = imap_setflag_full($connection, '1:'.$message, '\\Deleted');
    imap_expunge($connection);
    return $status;

    //return(imap_delete($connection,trim($message)));
}
?>
===============================================================================

the function is using the message number (and not the uid !)
$uid = $mail->uid;
$msgno = $mail->msgno;

if you want to use the uid, simply option value
imap_delete($mbox, $uid, FT_UID);
===============================================================================

This function seems not to work on "[Gmail]/All Mail" mailbox. This is because
Gmails keeps only one copy of the message and mailboxes are no more than
labels.
Deleting a message from a mailbox only removes that label (except for "All
Mail" mailbox).
To delete from "All Mail" you have to use imap_mail_move() function and move
the message to "[Gmail]/Trash" mailbox.

Note: Names of mailboxes in Gmail depends on the language you're using.  E.g.:
in Spanish "All Mail" is "Todos" and "Trash" is "Papelera".
===============================================================================

In case you feel the need to kill all emails from before a certain year on your
Gmail account, this would work:

<?php
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ (E_NOTICE | E_WARNING));

echo "parsing ini file...\n";
$ini = parse_ini_file('g.ini');
$user = $ini['user'];
$pass = $ini['pass'];
$year = $ini['year'];
echo "account {$user} - killing msgs from before {$year}\n\n";

echo "connecting...\n";
$imap = imap_open("{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl/novalidate-cert}[Gmail]/All
Mail", $user, $pass) or die("can't connect: " . imap_last_error() . "\n");

echo "checking current mailbox...\n";
$mbox = imap_check($imap);

echo "fetching overview...\n";
$flaggedForDelete = 0;
for($n = 0; $n < $mbox->Nmsgs; $n++) {
    echo "processing {$n} of {$mbox->Nmsgs}...\r";
    $hdr = imap_fetchheader($imap, $n);
    preg_match('/^Date: (.*?)$/m', $hdr, $matches);
    $date = date_parse(strtotime($matches[1]));
    if($date['year'] < $year) {
        imap_delete($imap, $msg->msgno);
        $flaggedForDelete++;
    }
}

echo "expunging mailbox ({$flaggedForDelete} messages flagged)... ";
echo ((imap_expunge($imap)) ? "ok" : "failed!")."\n";
imap_close($imap);

?>
===============================================================================

After a little experimentation i found out how to mark a single message for
deletion...

<?php

$msgid = '5'; //For example

imap_delete($mbox, "$msgid:$msgid");

?>

imap_delete() seems to want a range, so to select one, simply range from your
id to your id.

Hope this helps.
===============================================================================

Somehow, when ever I try to delete an email using the message number returned
by imap_header, any email with a message number below 999 will fail.

I discovered that the imap_header will pad the message number with spaces. You
will need to trim the number before calling imap_delete.

I am using qmail and it took me over a month to figure it out.

Hope this will be helpful to some poor soul out there facing the same problem.
===============================================================================

// is not a complete code but enough to clear out an entire mailbox.
// hope this can save your time :-)

<?php

if (isset($_REQUEST['DoNow']))
{
  # PULL ADDITIONAL FILES
  include_once ("common.php");
 
  $conn = @imap_open("\{$server/$serverType}Trash", $user, $pass)
  or die("Connection to folder failed");
 
  $headers = @imap_check($conn);
  ($headers->Nmsgs > 0) or die("Trash is empty already !");
 
  // delete email(s)
  @imap_delete($conn,'1:*');   // to clear out an entire mailbox.
  @imap_expunge($conn);
  echo "Trash is empty.";
 
  imap_close($conn);
}
else
{
  echo "<form name='formA' action='".$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']."' method='POST'>"; 
?>
  Are you sure to empty trash ?
  <p>
  <input type="submit" value="Go Ahead" name="DoNow">&nbsp;
  <input type="button" value="Cancel" name="Cancel" onClick=
'javascript:self.history.go(-1)'></form></p>
<?php
} ?>
===============================================================================

Just so anyone using this function is aware: if you mark an email to be deleted
from a mailbox, that flag does not persist. You need to call imap_expunge() or
use the  CL_EXPUNGE option with imap_close() to remove the marked email in the
same PHP script you marked it in.

I hope this helps someone out.
===============================================================================

I think you don't have to give a range to imap_delete() if you want to delete a
single one.

This works well:

<?php

imap_delete($conn,trim($msgno));   

?>

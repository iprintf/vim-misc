oci_result

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PECL OCI8 >= 1.1.0)

oci_result — 返回所取得行中字段的值

说明

mixed oci_result ( resource $statement , mixed $field )

oci_result() 返回由 oci_fetch() 所取得的当前行中 field 字段的数据。oci_result()
对所有类型都返回字符串只除了抽象类型（ROWID，LOB 和 FILE）。oci_result() 在出错
时返回 FALSE。

可以使用列序号（从 1 开始）或列名（大写）作为 col 的参数。

    Note:

    在 PHP 5.0.0 之前的版本必须使用 ociresult() 替代本函数。该函数名仍然可用，
    为向下兼容作为 oci_result() 的别名。不过其已被废弃，不推荐使用。

要获取 OCI8 扩展进行数据类型映射的细节，请参见驱动所支持的数据类型。

参见 oci_fetch_array()，oci_fetch_assoc()，oci_fetch_object()，oci_fetch_row()
和 oci_fetch_all()。

参数

statement

field

    Can be either use the column number (1-based) or the column name (in
    uppercase).

返回值

Returns everything as strings except for abstract types (ROWIDs, LOBs and
FILEs). Returns FALSE on error.

注释

    Note:

    In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use ociresult() instead. This name
    still can be used, it was left as alias of oci_result() for downwards
    compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.

参见

  • oci_fetch_array() - Returns the next row from a query as an associative or
    numeric array
  • oci_fetch_assoc() - Returns the next row from a query as an associative
    array
  • oci_fetch_object() - Returns the next row from a query as an object
  • oci_fetch_row() - Returns the next row from a query as a numeric array
  • oci_fetch_all() - 获取结果数据的所有行到一个数组

if you want to join two tables having both the same column (e.g. 'id') but you
don't want to (or cannot) specify all the other fields in these two tables
(like erabbott mentioned), you can use:

SELECT t1.*, t2.*, t1.id AS id1, t2.id AS id2
FROM table1 t1, table2 t2;

Note that this does _not_ work:

SELECT *,t1.id AS id1, t2.id AS id2
FROM table1 t1, table2 t2;

I am trying to get a list of the first character of a character string.

SELECT distinct substr(version,1,1) as COL1 FROM SPHVVERS where Version is not
null order by 1

This was working and then failed recently. I think it is because some of the
strings now added contain a number as the first character.

I found to get it to work I had to use decode statement. (To_Char did not work
)

SELECT distinct decode (substr(version,1,1),'1','?','0','!',substr
(version,1,1)) as COL1 FROM SPHVVERS where Version is not null order by 1
===============================================================================

As in my previous post, the same thing applies when using conversion functions
in CLOB columns.

Probably the same thing will occur to any conversion function that you use.

So, this wont work

SELECT ... TO_CHAR(MY_CLOB) ...

$my_clob = OCIResult($stmt,"MY_CLOB");

But this will:

SELECT ... TO_CHAR(MY_CLOB) AS MYC ...

$my_clob = OCIResult($stmt,"MYC");

Best regards.
===============================================================================

Note that if you are making multiple table selects, you must specify an alias
to each column.

This wont work:
----------------------------------------
$qry = "SELECT A.COL_ONE, B.COL_ONE FROM TABLE1 A, TABLE2 B";
$stmt = OCIParse($conn, $qry);

while(OCIFetch($stmt))
{
    $a = OCIResult($stmt, "A.COL_ONE");
...
----------------------------------------

But this will:
----------------------------------------
$qry = "SELECT A.COL_ONE AS X, B.COL_ONE AS Y FROM TABLE1 A, TABLE2 B";
$stmt = OCIParse($conn, $qry);

while(OCIFetch($stmt))
{
    $a = OCIResult($stmt, "X");
...
----------------------------------------

I complained that I couldn't get the time from an Oracle date field.  Joe Brown
said:

This is not a PHP bug.

Consider setting NLS_DATE_FORMAT.

The manual states OCIResult() returns everything as a string.
NLS_DATE_FORMAT may not be appropriate for your needs.

There are quite a few places you can set NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
* Environment variables (or windows registry on win32)
* orclSID.ora
* on a per session basis; execute this statement after logon:

$cursor=OCIParse($connection,
"ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'");
OCIExecute($cursor);
OCIFreeCursor($cursor);
===============================================================================

OCIResult() requires the column name to be written in capitals, so OCIResult
($stmt,"column") won't work, but OCIResult($stmt,"COLUMN") works fine. Hope
that helps somebody out
===============================================================================

FYI--

In order to modify Oracle dates (using NLS_DATE_FORMAT...), you must set
$ORACLE_HOME first.  This environmental variable is best set in the server
startup script (i.e., ./apachectl)

As this function gets a 'mixed' variable type for the column index, you may use
an integer to represent the column number. In this case, the count is starting
from 1 and not from zero.
I am not sure, but I think this method is a bit faster than using the column
name.
For an example, see the OCINumCols first example.

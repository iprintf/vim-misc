Note, https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40459 shows that __construct() not being
called in all cases was a bug, and it was fixed in August 2012.
===============================================================================

Just to clarify what was said above, as far as I can tell,  __construct is
*only* called before stream_open.

It does not get called for other functions such as stream::url_stat  or
stream::unlink, even though those functions do create a new object.

This behavior is contrary to normal expectations for php object creation.  But
based on the documentation above I can only assume that it is by design.

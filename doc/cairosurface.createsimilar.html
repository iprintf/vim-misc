CairoSurface::createSimilar — The createSimilar purpose

说明

public void CairoSurface::createSimilar ( CairoSurface $other , int $content , 
string $width , string $height )

Create a new surface that is as compatible as possible with an existing
surface. For example the new surface will have the same fallback resolution and
font options as other. Generally, the new surface will also use the same
backend as other, unless that is not possible for some reason. The type of the
returned surface may be examined with CairoSurface::getType(). Initially the
surface contents are all 0 (transparent if contents have transparency, black
otherwise.)

参数

content

    values.

width

    Width of the new surface, (in device-space units).

height

    Height of the new surface, (in device-space units).

返回值

A new CairoSurface

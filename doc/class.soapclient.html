(PHP 5 >= 5.0.1, PHP 7)

简介

The SoapClient class provides a client for » SOAP 1.1, » SOAP 1.2 servers. It
can be used in WSDL or non-WSDL mode.

When you need to connect to services requiring to send extra header use this
method.

Here how we can to it with PHP and SoapClient

<?php
class exampleChannelAdvisorAuth
{
    public $DeveloperKey;
    public $Password;

    public function __construct($key, $pass)
    {
        $this->DeveloperKey = $key;
        $this->Password = $pass;
    }
}

$devKey        = "";
$password    = "";
$accountId    = "";

// Create the SoapClient instance
$url         = "";
$client     = new SoapClient($url, array("trace" => 1, "exception" => 0));

// Create the header
$auth         = new ChannelAdvisorAuth($devKey, $password);
$header     = new SoapHeader("http://www.example.com/webservices/", 
"APICredentials", $auth, false);

// Call wsdl function
$result = $client->__soapCall("DeleteMarketplaceAd", array(
    "DeleteMarketplaceAd" => array(
        "accountID"        => $accountId,
        "marketplaceAdID"    => "9938745"        // The ads ID
    )
), NULL, $header);

// Echo the result
echo "<pre>".print_r($result, true)."</pre>";
if($result->DeleteMarketplaceAdResult->Status == "Success")
{
    echo "Item deleted!";
}
?>

After migrating to PHP 5.6.5, the soap 1.2 did not work anymore. So I solved
the problem by adding optional parameters SSL.
My error: failed to load external entity
How to solve:
        // options for ssl in php 5.6.5
        $opts = array(
            'ssl' => array('ciphers'=>'RC4-SHA', 'verify_peer'=>false,
'verify_peer_name'=>false)
        );
        // SOAP 1.2 client
        $params = array ('encoding' => 'UTF-8', 'verifypeer' => false,
'verifyhost' => false, 'soap_version' => SOAP_1_2, 'trace' => 1, 'exceptions'
=> 1, "connection_timeout" => 180, 'stream_context' => stream_context_create
($opts) );
        $oSoapClient = new SoapClient ( $url . "?WSDL", $params );
===============================================================================

when they want to pass variables into the http header that is how it is done:

<?php

$aHTTP['http']['header'] =  "User-Agent: PHP-SOAP/5.5.11\r\n";

$aHTTP['http']['header'].= "username: XXXXXXXXXXX\r\n"."password: XXXXX\r\n";

$context = stream_context_create($aHTTP);

$client=new SoapClient("https://ocppws-cert.extra.bcv.org.ve:443/AltoValor/
BancoUniversal?WSDL",array('trace' => 1,"stream_context" => $context));

$result = $client->jornadaActiva();
var_dump($result);
?>

I posted in this URL http://softontherocks.blogspot.com/2014/02/
web-service-soap-con-php.html a full example of a nusoap web service.

There is defined the server and the cliente who calls the web service.

I hope it would be useful for you.
===============================================================================

If you want to connect to a server that only supports SSLv2/3 and/or TLS 1.0
(no TLS 2 or 3), tell the SOAP client if you get a connection error by setting
the appropriate stream context:
<?php
  $opts = array(
    'ssl' => array('ciphers'=>'RC4-SHA')
  );

  $objSoapClient = new SoapClient(
    'https://example.com/?wsdl',
    array ( "encoding"=>"ISO-8859-1",
    'stream_context' => stream_context_create($opts)
    // your options
    );
?>

You might need to disable the SOAP caching of WSDLs in order for the SOAP
client to use the new context.
===============================================================================

There is a known bug with some versions of Xdebug which can cause SoapClient to
not throw an exception but instead cause a fatal error.

Surround the SoapClient call with xdebug_disable(); and xdebug_enable();  to
work around this problem.

For reference:

http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=249
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47584
===============================================================================

If you are making soap calls in WSDL mode , and the address of your web service
includes a port different from 80 (like http://my_ip_address:8080//
service.asmx?wsdl), the WSDL file is fetched correctly, but all subsequent
requests are made without any port in the host field. This causes a SoapFault
exception when trying to call any of the service’s methods.

You need to redefine the soapClient class and force the port in each call.

See this example:

CAUTION:
I had quite a bit of trouble trying to make a request with fopen through a
proxy to a secure url.  I kept getting a 400 Bad Request back from the remote
host.  It was receiving the proxy url as the SNI host.  In order to get around
this I had to explicity set the SNI host to the domain I was trying to reach. 
It's apparently the issue outlined in this bug:

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=63519

<?php
$domain = parse_url($file, PHP_URL_HOST);
$proxy_string = "tcp://" . WP_PROXY_HOST  . ":" . WP_PROXY_PORT;
$opts = array(
    'http' => array( 'proxy' => $proxy_string ),
    'ssl' => array( 'SNI_enabled' => true, 'SNI_server_name' => $domain));
$context = stream_context_create($opts);
$handle = fopen( $file, 'r', false, $context );
?>

When you get errors like:
"Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception: [HTTP] Error Fetching http headers
in"
after a few (time intensive) SOAP-Calls, check your webserver-config.

Sometimes the webservers "KeepAlive"-Setting tends to result in this error. For
SOAP-Environments I recommend you to disable KeepAlive.

Hint: It might be tricky to create a dedicated vhost for your SOAP-Gateways and
disable keepalive just for this vhost because for normal webpages Keepalive is
a nice speed-boost.
===============================================================================

If the XML have identities with same name in different levels there is a
solution. You don´t have to ever submit a raw XML (this PHP SOAP object don´t
allows send a RAW XML), so you have to always translate your XML to a array,
like the example below:

$originalXML = "
<xml>
  <firstClient>
      <name>someone</name>
      <adress>R. 1001</adress>
  </firstClient>
  <secondClient>
      <name>another one</name>
      <adress></adress>
  </secondClient>
</xml>"

//Translate the XML above in a array, like PHP SOAP function requires
$myParams = array('firstClient' => array('name' => 'someone',
                                  'adress' => 'R. 1001'),
            'secondClient' => array('name' => 'another one',
                                  'adress' => ''));

$webService = new SoapClient($someURL);
$result = $webService->someWebServiceFunction($myParams);
===============================================================================

Please note, that if you provide values that contain illegal xml characters
(ASCII codes 0-8,  11-12, 14-15 - or x0-x8, xB-xC, xE-xF in hex), php's
SoapClient will do send them in request, although such request is improper
because it does not meet XML 1.0 requirements.
You always have to replace or remove these characters in your data before
supplying them to SoapClient
===============================================================================

To make an HTTPS call with a client certificate, you can do it this way:

1) Create a file containing both the key and the signed certificate. I did this
by concatenating my (.pem) key and the certificate I've got signed from my CA
(also .pem format). The file looked like this:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIICXAIBAAKagQC1N27Ilb9pWil2NaX2qM8FquXBXK5T1AydOv7sCotsc8MAwbi7
......(snip)......
wAiOCD4K9TyMS76pIS8UyfJl/oIrn7EF24BUpaUfsh8=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIC/zCCAmigAwIBAgIEAIl1JzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQuADBQMQswCQYxVQQGEaJV
......(snip)......
eSPds1hLKYSg0bd3uI7LhaDLOC1PPgb77sYe/uYkUWuHBzllts5x/pfue0zaIBKG
Omjy
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

2) Reference your certificate in the creation of the SOAP client, like this:

$protected_url = "https://my-server/?wsdl";
$my_cert_file = "/my/path/to/mycert.pem";

$client = new SoapClient($protected_url, array('local_cert', $my_cert_file) );
===============================================================================

In addition to the KeepAlive trick which is a "server-side" modification, on
the "client side" default_socket_timeout should be increased from its default
value (60) when you deal with ~slow SOAP servers.
As for the KeepAlive, if creating a new separate vhost for the soap api is not
possible, you can add this to your existing vhost: BrowserMatch "^PHP-SOAP"
nokeepalive
where PHP-SOAP is the agent name of your soap client, if you dont know what
agent name your client use, just checkout the access.log of your apache.
===============================================================================

Well, this example works fine:

<?php
try { 
    $x = @new SoapClient("non-existent.wsdl"); 
} catch (Exception $e) { 
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
?>

Just make sure use NEW with @.
===============================================================================

when they want to pass variables into the http header that is how it is done:

<?php

$aHTTP['http']['header'] =  "User-Agent: PHP-SOAP/5.5.11\r\n";

$aHTTP['http']['header'].= "username: C1040001760102\r\n"."password: bcv2020\r\
n";

$context = stream_context_create($aHTTP);

$client=new SoapClient("https://ocppws-cert.extra.bcv.org.ve:443/AltoValor/
BancoUniversal?WSDL",array('trace' => 1,"stream_context" => $context));

$result = $client->jornadaActiva();
var_dump($result);
?>
===============================================================================

I got the following error when trying to load the WSDL file:

Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception: [WSDL] SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL:
<message> 'MessageName' already defined

In my case there was no double definitions but it was including other files - I
think one of them contained a duplicate message with a different namespace
(which SoapClient doesn't like).

I resolved it by loading the WSDL in SoapUI, right-clicking and selecting
"Export definition". The WSDL that then got created worked fine. Hope this
helps somebody.

This one drove me nuts... if you are connecting to a web service run on
Cassini, (Visual Studio's web server) from php, you may not be able to call web
service functions or load a WSDL out-of-the-box.

My set up is that I am using xampp on my windows development machine, and also
using Visual Studio's built in web-server. I built a web service in visual
studio. I wrote a simple PHP script, running under xampp, to access this
service, so the two projects can 'talk' to each other. What I found was the
WSDL was never loaded.

So I moved the WSDL local to the PHP file and accessed it directly. Still no
calls. Turns out, PHP's SoapClient seems to have a problem with 'localhost' as
a web service endpoint. So I hand-edited the web service endpoint URL to read
127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, and Voila! Web Service calls work:

Here is my PHP, now working:
<?php
$client = new SoapClient("http://localhost/code/soap.wsdl");
$something =  $client->HelloWorld(array());
echo $something->HelloWorldResult;
die();

?>

Here is my modified WSDL:
  <wsdl:service name="MyService">
    <wsdl:port name="MyServiceSoap" binding="tns:MyServiceSoap">
      <soap:address location="http://127.0.0.1:55274/MyService/MyService.asmx"
/>
....

    </wsdl:port>

Hi,

can you more specified how to solve this?
i also stuck in here.

Thanks

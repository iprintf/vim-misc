mssql_init — Initializes a stored procedure or a remote stored procedure

Warning

This function was REMOVED in PHP 7.0.0.

Alternatives to this function include:

  • Using an EXEC query issued through PDO_SQLSRV, PDO_ODBC, SQLSRV, or the
    unified ODBC driver.

说明

resource mssql_init ( string $sp_name [, resource $link_identifier ] )

Initializes a stored procedure or a remote stored procedure.

参数

sp_name

    Stored procedure name, like ownew.sp_name or otherdb.owner.sp_name.

link_identifier

    A MS SQL link identifier, returned by mssql_connect().

返回值

Returns a resource identifier "statement", used in subsequent calls to 
mssql_bind() and mssql_execute(), or FALSE on errors.

范例

Example #1 mssql_init() example

<?php
// Connect to MSSQL and select the database
$link = mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');
mssql_select_db('php', $link);

// Create a new statement
$stmt = mssql_init('StatementTest', $link);

// Bind values here

// Once values are binded we execute our statement 
// using mssql_execute:
mssql_execute($stmt);

// And we can free it like so:
mssql_free_statement($stmt);
?>

  • mssql_bind() - Adds a parameter to a stored procedure or a remote stored
    procedure
  • mssql_execute() - Executes a stored procedure on a MS SQL server database
  • mssql_free_statement() - Free statement memory

===============================================================================

If you are performing a stored procedure inside a loop, it is a good idea to
unset the variable that mssql_init returns so that you do NOT bind multiple
values to the same stored procedure:

foreach($input  as $sid=>$value) {
  $stmt = mssql_init("sp_doSomething");
  mssql_bind($stmt, "@sid", $sid, SQLINT4, false);
  mssql_bind($stmt, "@value", $value, SQLINT4, false);
  $result = mssql_execute($stmt);
  unset($stmt);  // <---VERY important
}

Even doing the mssql_init outside the loop does not help because of the
multiple binds happening inside the loop.

Failing to do the above generates "Access Violations...memory cannot be
'written'" errors on the server.  My hypothesis is that the error is generated
when you try to bind to a stored procedure after it has already been executed. 
You have been warned.
===============================================================================

this function was created to support 
OUTPUT parameters and return values with
MSSQL stored procedures. Before this,
you could use T-SQL statement EXECUTE
and mssql_query to execute a stored
procedure, and it was fine as long as
you don't need to retrieve OUTPUT or
RETVAL values.


Now you can use this set of functions to execute and retrieve these values:
mssql_init
mssql_bind
mssql_execute

Parameters:
- sp_name : stored procedure name. It passes this string to a native DB-lib
call, so I guess it supports all kinds of schemas (like "ownew.sp_name" or
"otherdb.owner.sp_name")

- connection id: a connection resource
obtained with mssql_connect or similar.
If not provided, it will proceed just
like other similar mssql_* functions:
uses a default open connection or
creates a new one.

Return value: a resource id, called
"statement", used in subsequent calls to
mssql_bind and mssql_execute.

Note that many of the native MSSQL data types are directly supported, but I
think that some others must be converted
by other means (from varchar values for
example). These unsupported types are:

SQLMONEY4,SQLMONEY,SQLBIT,SQLDATETIM4,
SQLDATETIME, SQLDECIMAL, SQLNUMERIC,
SQLVARBINARY, SQLBINARY,SQLIMAGE

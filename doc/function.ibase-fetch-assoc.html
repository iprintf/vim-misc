ibase_fetch_assoc — Fetch a result row from a query as an associative array

说明

array ibase_fetch_assoc ( resource $result [, int $fetch_flag = 0 ] )

Fetch a result row from a query as an associative array.

ibase_fetch_assoc() fetches one row of data from the result. If two or more
columns of the result have the same field names, the last column will take
precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name, you either need to
access the result with numeric indices by using ibase_fetch_row() or use alias
names in your query.

参数

result

    The result handle.

fetch_flag

    fetch_flag is a combination of the constants IBASE_TEXT and IBASE_UNIXTIME
    ORed together. Passing IBASE_TEXT will cause this function to return BLOB
    contents instead of BLOB ids. Passing IBASE_UNIXTIME will cause this
    function to return date/time values as Unix timestamps instead of as
    formatted strings.

返回值

Returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row. Subsequent
calls will return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more
rows.

===============================================================================

Unlike mysql_fetch_assoc, all indexes of associative array are upper-case.

so, use
$row = ibase_fetch_assoc($result);

echo $row["INDEX"];
not
echo $row["index"];
===============================================================================

If your php is older than version 4.3.0, you can use the following:

$arr_record = get_object_vars(ibase_fetch_object($sql_result));

which is the same as: $arr_record = ibase_fetch_assoc($sql_result);

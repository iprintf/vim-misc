proc_get_status — 获取由 proc_open() 函数打开的进程的信息

说明

array proc_get_status ( resource $process )

proc_get_status() 函数可以获取由 proc_open() 函数打开的进程的信息。

参数

===============================================================================

On Unix/Linux, if you change the command line you pass to proc_open() just
slightly then proc_get_status() will give you the actual process-id (pid) of
your child.

Suppose you wish to run the external command /usr/bin/compress to create a BSD
foo.Z file.  Rather than proc_open("/usr/bin/compress /tmp/foo",...) you may
invoke proc_open("exec /usr/bin/compress /tmp/foo",...) and then
proc_get_status()['pid'] will be the actual pid of /usr/bin/compress.

Why?  Because the way proc_open() actually works on Unix/Linux is by starting "
/bin/sh -c usercmd userargs...", e.g., "/bin/sh -c /usr/bin/compress /tmp/foo".
[Note 1]  That means normally your command is the child of the shell, so the
pid you retrieve with proc_get_status() is the pid of the shell (PHP's child),
and you have to fumble around trying to find the pid of your command (PHP's
grandchild).  But if you put "exec" in front of your command, you tell the
shell to *replace itself* with your command without starting another process
(technically, to exec your command without forking first).  That means your
command will inherit the pid of the shell, which is the pid that
proc_get_status() returns.

So if you would like the actual pid of the process running your command, just
prepend "exec " to  your proc_open() command argument then retrieve the pid
using proc_get_status().

This also makes proc_terminate() and proc_close() work more like you might
prefer, since they will affect the actual process running your command (which
will be a child process rather than a grandchild process).

[Note 1] My guess is that the PHP developers want the shell to expand wildcards
in path/filenames.
===============================================================================

It is worth noting that proc_get_status will continue to indicate the process
that you spawned is running (because it is!) until that process has been able
to write everything it wants to write to the STDOUT and STDERR streams.

PHP seems to use a buffer for this and so the spawned process can can get it's
write calls to return immediately.

However, once this buffer is full the write call will block until you read out
some of the information from the stream/pipe.

This can manifest itself in many ways but generally the called process will
still be running, but just not doing anything as it is blocking on being able
to write more to STDERR or STDOUT -- whichever stream buffer is full.

To work around this you should include in your loop of checking
proc_get_status' running element a "stream_get_contents" on the relevant pipes.

I generally use stream_set_blocking($pipies[2], 0) kind of calls to make sure
that the stream_get_contents call will not block if there is no data in the
stream.

This one had me stumped for a while, so hopefully it helps someone!
===============================================================================

For clarification, the "exitcode" is only valid the FIRST TIME IT IS CALLED
after the process exits.

If you have a method that polls a spawned process for its status, you *MUST*
have that same method capture the exitcode: if the method is called a second
time (after realizing the pid is dead) and it hasn't cached that exitcode, it
will receive the -1 mentioned.
===============================================================================

You can NOT rely on pid+1.
You could prefix exec to the command string, this will replace the /bin/sh
script with the real thing you want to exec (use only if you don't do 'scary
things' like pipes, output redirection, multiple commands, however if you know
how they work, go ahead).
If you prefix exec, the /bin/sh process will only start your process, and the
PID will be the same.
===============================================================================

Alternatively, if you're calling a subsequent php script using proc_open, you
can have that process echo its own actual PID in the output.
Also, if you go through the /proc filesystem on linux, you can read through /
proc/12345 where 12345 is the pid returned by proc_get_status (the pid of the /
bin/sh instance) and it will list its child processes within.
===============================================================================

Further to my previous note, I've found out the PID returned is the PID of the
shell (/bin/sh) that then runs the actual command requested.

I've raised this as bug #41003.
===============================================================================

The following function takes an array of shell commands and executes them. It
is able to execute up to $nb_max_process at the same time. As soon as one
process is terminated, another one is executed. Quite useful if you want to
batch process commands on a multi-processor or multi-core environment.

The example below tries to convert to PNG a list of SVG files submitted on the
command line (using Inkscape).

(it's quick and dirty but works very well for me)

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function pool_execute($commandes,$nb_max_process) {
  $pool=array();
  for($i=0;$i<$nb_max_process;$i++) {
    $pool[$i]=FALSE;
  }

  while(count($commandes)>0) {
    $commande=array_shift($commandes);

    $commande_lancee=FALSE;
    while($commande_lancee==FALSE) {
      usleep(50000);

      for($i=0;$i<$nb_max_process and $commande_lancee==FALSE;$i++) {
        if($pool[$i]===FALSE) {
          $pool[$i]=proc_open($commande,array(),$foo);
          $commande_lancee=TRUE;
        } else {
          $etat=proc_get_status($pool[$i]);
          if($etat['running']==FALSE) {
            proc_close($pool[$i]);
            $pool[$i]=proc_open($commande,array(),$foo);
            $commande_lancee=TRUE;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

$fichiers=$argv;
array_shift($fichiers);
$commandes=array();
foreach($fichiers as $fichier) {
  $entree=$fichier;
  $sortie=basename($fichier,'.svg').".png";
  $commandes[]='inkscape --file='.escapeshellarg($entree).'
--export-area-canvas --export-png='.escapeshellarg($sortie);
}

pool_execute($commandes,4);

To the poster above, same here on FreeBSD 6.1, PHP 5.2.1.

To get the correct PID to use for posix_kill I have to add 1 to the PID
returned from proc_get_status.
===============================================================================

I have had lots of problems in the past bit trying to kill external commands
run by proc_open.

Others have suggested using ps to find the children of the pid returned by
proc_get_status, but on my system this doesn't work.  I'm using php-5.2.5 and
apache-2.0.59 on linux kernel 2.6.21, and the processes I start with proc_open
end up being owned by init (pid 1), not by the pid returned by proc_get_status.

I did notice, however, that the pid's of the processes were always above and
very close to the proc_get_status pid.  Using that information, I wrote a
little function that takes the name of a command, the starting pid at which to
search (which would be the proc_get_status pid), and optionally a search limit
as arguments.  It will use ps to list processes owned by apache (you may have
to change this user name for your system), and search for the command
specified.  The limit tells how far above the starting pid to search.  This
will help if the command may have already exited, and you don't want to kill a
process from a different session than the one you're working with.

Here's the code:

<?php
function findCommandPID($command, $startpid, $limit = 3)
{
    $ps = `ps -u apache --sort=pid -o comm= -o pid=`;
    $ps_lines = explode("\n", $ps);

    $pattern = "/(\S{1,})(\s{1,})(\d{1,})/";

    foreach($ps_lines as $line)
    {
        if(preg_match($pattern, $line, $matches))
        {
            //this limits us to finding the command within $limit pid's of the
parent;
            //eg, if ppid = 245, limit = 3, we won't search past 248
            if($matches[3] > $startpid + $limit)
                break;

            //try to match a ps line where the command matches our search
            //at a higher pid than our parent
            if($matches[1] == $command && $matches[3] > $startpid)
                return $matches[3];
        }
    }

    return false;
}
?>

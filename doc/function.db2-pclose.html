(PECL ibm_db2 >= 1.8.0)

db2_pclose — Closes a persistent database connection

说明

bool db2_pclose ( resource $resource )

This function closes a DB2 client connection created with db2_pconnect() and
returns the corresponding resources to the database server.


    Note:

    This function is only available on i5/OS in response to i5/OS system
    administration requests.

If you have a persistent DB2 client connection created with db2_pconnect(), you
may use this function to close the connection. To avoid substantial connection
performance penalties, this function should only be used in rare cases when the
persistent connection has become unresponsive or the persistent connection will
not be needed for a long period of time.

参数

connection

    Specifies an active DB2 client connection.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Closing a persistent connection

The following example demonstrates a successful attempt to close a connection
to an IBM DB2 i5/OS database.

<?php
$conn = db2_pconnect('', '', '');
$rc = db2_pclose($conn);
if ($rc) {
    echo "Connection was successfully closed.";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

Connection was successfully closed.

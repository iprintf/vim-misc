===============================================================================

if you use this function following:

<?php
$query = ifx_query("SELECT * FROM systables", $connection);
$rows  = ifx_num_rows($query);
?>

this way it doesn't work...

the correct is:

<?php
$query = ifx_query("SELECT * FROM systables", $connection);
$fetch = ifx_fetch_row($query);
$rows  = ifx_num_rows($query);
?>

this way it work...

the informix doesn't returns anything (only with ifx_num_rows) if you don't
open the results of query (with ifx_fetch_row)
===============================================================================

This function give always 0 as result so I used ifx_affected_rows to count rows
of a query's result...

An example of this function:

$conn_id = ifx_connect("db", "user", "password");
$res_id = ifx_query("select * from systables", $conn_id);
$res = ifx_affected_rows($res_id);
echo $res;

$res contains the number of rows in the result of the query after his
execution.

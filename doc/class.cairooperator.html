The CairoOperator class

(No version information available, might only be in Git)

简介

This is used to set the compositing operator for all cairo drawing operations.

The default operator is CairoOperator::OVER

The operators marked as unbounded modify their destination even outside of the
mask layer (that is, their effect is not bound by the mask layer). However,
their effect can still be limited by way of clipping.

To keep things simple, the operator descriptions here document the behavior for
when both source and destination are either fully transparent or fully opaque.
The actual implementation works for translucent layers too. For a more detailed
explanation of the effects of each operator, including the mathematical
definitions, see http://cairographics.org/operators/.

预定义常量

CairoOperator::CLEAR

    Clear destination layer (bounded)

CairoOperator::SOURCE

    Replace destination layer (bounded)

CairoOperator::OVER

    Draw source layer on top of destination layer (bounded)

CairoOperator::IN

    Draw source where there was destination content (unbounded)

CairoOperator::OUT

    Draw source where there was no destination content (unbounded)

CairoOperator::ATOP

    Draw source on top of destination content and only there

CairoOperator::DEST

    Ignore the source

CairoOperator::DEST_OVER

    Draw destination on top of source

CairoOperator::DEST_IN

    Leave destination only where there was source content (unbounded)

CairoOperator::DEST_OUT

    Leave destination only where there was no source content

CairoOperator::DEST_ATOP

    Leave destination on top of source content and only there (unbounded)

CairoOperator::XOR

    Source and destination are shown where there is only one of them

CairoOperator::ADD

    Source and destination layers are accumulated

CairoOperator::SATURATE

    Like CairoOperator::OVER, but assuming source and dest are disjoint
    geometries

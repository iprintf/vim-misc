Phar::mungServer

(Unknown)

Phar::mungServer — Defines a list of up to 4 $_SERVER variables that should be
modified for execution

说明

final public static void Phar::mungServer ( array $munglist )

Phar::mungServer() should only be called within the stub of a phar archive.

Defines a list of up to 4 $_SERVER variables that should be modified for
execution. Variables that can be modified to remove traces of phar execution
are REQUEST_URI, PHP_SELF, SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME.

On its own, this method does nothing. Only when combined with Phar::webPhar()
does it take effect, and only when the requested file is a PHP file to be
parsed. Note that the PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED variables are always
modified.

The original values of variables that are modified are stored in the SERVER
array with PHAR_ prepended, so for instance SCRIPT_NAME would be saved as
PHAR_SCRIPT_NAME.

参数

munglist

    an array containing as string indices any of REQUEST_URI, PHP_SELF,
    SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME. Other values trigger an exception, and 
    Phar::mungServer() is case-sensitive.

返回值

No return.

错误／异常

Throws UnexpectedValueException if any problems are found with the passed in
data.

win32_query_service_status — Queries the status of a service

说明

mixed win32_query_service_status ( string $servicename [, string $machine ] )

Queries the current status for a service, returning an array of information.

参数

servicename

    The short name of the service.

machine

    The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be used.

返回值

Returns an array consisting of the following information on success，参数错误时
返回 FALSE，或失败时返回一个 Win32 错误码。

ServiceType

    The dwServiceType. See Win32Service Service Type Bitmasks.

CurrentState

    The dwCurrentState. See Win32Service Service Status Constants.

ControlsAccepted

    Which service controls are accepted by the service. See Win32Service
    Service Control Message Accepted Bitmasks.

Win32ExitCode

    If the service exited, the return code from the process.

ServiceSpecificExitCode

    If the service exited with an error condition, the service specific code
    that is logged in the event log is visible here.

CheckPoint

    If the service is shutting down, holds the current check point number. This
    is used by the SCM as a kind of heart-beat to detect a wedged service
    process. The value of the check point is best interpreted in conjunction
    with the WaitHint value.

WaitHint

    If the service is shutting down it will set WaitHint to a checkpoint value
    that will indicate 100% completion. This can be used to implement a
    progress indicator.

ProcessId

    The Windows process identifier. If 0, the process is not running.

ServiceFlags

    The dwServiceFlags. See Win32Service Service Service Flag Constants.

===============================================================================

This function will return an array containing the above information as a return
value, but if this fails it will return an integer which is a System Error
Code. All the System Error Codes can be found here:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681381%28VS.85%29.aspx

In my case, it returned 5, in which I immediately knew why and fixed the issue
right away.

In the case of mnemotronic at netscape dot net, here in the documentation
notes, it returned 1060 which is:

ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
1060 (0x424)
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.

Again, it should not return FALSE, instead an System Error Code for Windows.

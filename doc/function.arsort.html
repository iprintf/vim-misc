(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

arsort — 对数组进行逆向排序并保持索引关系

说明

bool arsort ( array &$array [, int $sort_flags = SORT_REGULAR ] )

本函数对数组进行排序，数组的索引保持和单元的关联。

主要用于对那些单元顺序很重要的结合数组进行排序。

参数

array

    输入的数组。

sort_flags

    可以用可选的参数 sort_flags 改变排序的行为，详情见 sort()。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 arsort() 例子

<?php
$fruits = array("d" => "lemon", "a" => "orange", "b" => "banana", "c" => 
"apple");
arsort($fruits);
foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
    echo "$key = $val\n";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

a = orange
d = lemon
b = banana
c = apple

fruits 被按照字母顺序逆向排序，并且单元的索引关系不变。

If you need to sort a multi-demension array, for example, an array such as

$TeamInfo[$TeamID]["WinRecord"]
$TeamInfo[$TeamID]["LossRecord"]
$TeamInfo[$TeamID]["TieRecord"]
$TeamInfo[$TeamID]["GoalDiff"]
$TeamInfo[$TeamID]["TeamPoints"]

and you have say, 100 teams here, and want to sort by "TeamPoints":

first, create your multi-dimensional array. Now, create another, single
dimension array populated with the scores from the first array, and with
indexes of corresponding team_id... ie
$foo[25] = 14
$foo[47] = 42
or whatever.
Now, asort or arsort the second array.
Since the array is now sorted by score or wins/losses or whatever you put in
it, the indices are all hoopajooped.
If you just walk through the array, grabbing the index of each entry, (look at
the asort example. that for loop does just that) then the index you get will
point right back to one of the values of the multi-dimensional array.
Not sure if that's clear, but mail me if it isn't...

Needed to get the index of the max/highest value in an assoc array.
max() only returned the value, no index, so I did this instead.

<?php
reset($x);   // optional.
arsort($x);
$key_of_max = key($x);   // returns the index.
?>

A lot of people seem to trip up on this and ask me questions as to debugging.
Bear in mind that this returns boolean, and does not return an array of
affected items.

$array = array("One"=>1, "Three" => 3,"Two" =>2);
print_r(asort($array));

If successful, will return 1, and error if there is a string used. Useful to
note so then people stop asking me :D

If you are dealing with a multidimensional array you want to sort, then this
might be helpfull:

<?php
function array_sort($arr){
    if(empty($arr)) return $arr;
    foreach($arr as $k => $a){
        if(!is_array($a)){
            arsort($arr); // could be any kind of sort
            return $arr;
        }else{
            $arr[$k] = array_sort($a);
        }
    }
    return $arr;
}
?>

I was having trouble with the arsort() function on an older version of PHP
which was returning an error along the lines of 'wrong perameter count for
function arsort' when I tried to use a flag for numeric sorting (2/
SORT_NUMERIC).
I figured, as I only wanted to sort integers, I could pad numbers from the left
to a specific length with 0's (using the lpad function provided by
improv@magma.ca in the notes at http://www.php.net/manual/ref.strings.php).
A string sort then correctly sorts numerically (i.e. {30,2,10,21} becomes
{030,021,010,002} not {30,21,2,10}) when echoing the number an (int)
$string_name hides the leading 0's.

Made my day :).

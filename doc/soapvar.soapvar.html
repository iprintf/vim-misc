I spent hours trying to find how to send a request where an element is
repeated. Here is how I managed to do it:
<?php
$parm = array();
$parm[] = new SoapVar('123', XSD_STRING, null, null, 'customerNo' );
$parm[] = new SoapVar('THIS', XSD_STRING, null, null, 'selection' );
$parm[] = new SoapVar('THAT', XSD_STRING, null, null, 'selection' );
$resp = $client->getStuff( new SoapVar($parm, SOAP_ENC_OBJECT) );
?>

This will send something like:
<getStuff>
  <customerNo>123</customerNo>
  <selection>THIS</selection>
  <selection>THAT</selection>
</getStuff>

Hope this will save someone else's time.

I worked for hours to figure out how to create following structure:

<ns:Foo attr='bar'>
   <ns:Baz attr='foobar'>barbaz</ns:Baz>
</ns:Foo>

It can be done with following array structure:

$arr = array(
  'Foo' => array(
     'attr'=>'bar',
     'Baz'=>array( '_' => 'barbaz', 'attr'=>'foobar')
  )
);
===============================================================================

This class is useful when dealing with the "anyType" type (generic object
reference): it lets you specify the xsd type to provide "late binding" type
information.

Here's a really simple example: I have a .NET service that can take a string, a
date, and integer, or other types, so I use the .NET "object" type. Here's an
example of such a service--this one just tells me what type I passed in. (It's
nice to use when checking to see if PHP passed in the type information the way
.NET expects it.)

//inside a service.asmx.cs file...
[WebMethod]
public string WhatTypeIsThis(object ObjectParameter)
{
   return "You passed in a " + ObjectParameter.GetType().Name
     + ": " + ObjectParamter.ToString();
}

To call this service with a string from PHP, I used this code:
<?php
//set up the service client using WSDL
$client = new SoapClient("http://localhost/folder/service.asmx?WSDL");

//This is the variable that will be typed as an XSD string
$typedVar = new SoapVar("mystring", XSD_STRING, "string", "http://www.w3.org/
2001/XMLSchema");
//This is the wrapper object for incoming parameters
$wrapper->ObjectParameter = $typedVar;
//This is the named parameter object that will be passed in to the service
$params = new SoapParam($wrapper, "WhatTypeIsThis");

//call the service with the string
$result = $client->WhatTypeIsThis($params);
//show the result
echo $result->WhatTypeIsThisResult;
?>

The output from this should be:
"You passed in a String: mystring"

The SOAP message that is passed in looks like this:
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://
www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:ns1="http://tempuri.org/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:WhatTypeIsThis>
            <ns1:ObjectParameter xsi:type="xsd:string">mystring</
ns1:ObjectParameter>
        </ns1:WhatTypeIsThis>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

It's that xsi:type="xsd:string" that gives .NET the heads up that though the
ObjectParameter is being passed in as an object, it is also a string.

When trying other types, it's helpful to see exactly what is being sent to the
service--to see the SOAP messages like the one above, use the trace option when
making your SOAP client and then call the $client->__getLastRequest() function.
(See http://www.php.net/soap_soapclient_getlastrequest)  You may need to use
try/catch constructs if you're generating errors.

Another helpful function is var_dump($client->__getTypes())--it shows how PHP
parsed the WSDL file to create types to pass back and forth.

It might be obvious to some but not to everyone
if you ever wondered how to encode attribute in soap object, use proper coding
and not hacking by passing xml and flag XSD_ANYXML

try using this
<?php
$amount['_'] = 25;
$amount['currencyId'] = 'GBP';
$encodded = new SoapVar($amount, SOAP_ENC_OBJECT);

?>
and end result wound be
<amount currencyId="GBP">25</amount>

hope that helps someone
===============================================================================

One potential gotcha with this is that if the XML you are passing in has the <?
xml... declaration, it may cause problems on the server side. It's best to
strip this out with str_replace.

To send requests containing ComplexTypes we needed to create stdClass objects
for each ComplexType. If the ComplexType has an attribute we created a class
with all the fields and attributes as members and added this class to the
classmap with the correct type name from the wsdl. For example:

//to create soap client
            $soapClient = new SoapClient("<your wsdl url>",
                 array('classmap' => array('RoomType' => 'RoomType'), 'trace'
=> 1));
                
             //creating request object using custom class since there is an
attribute needed

    class RoomType {
        //attribute
        var $code;       
        var $name;
    }
            $RoomType = new RoomType();
            $RoomType->code = $code;
           
                        //plain stdClass is ok since no attributes defined
            $LRoomCode = new stdClass();
            $LRoomCode->RoomType = new SoapVar($RoomType, SOAP_ENC_OBJECT,
"RoomType", "<your namespace url from wsdl>");
           
            //define a basic class object since attributes are not needed for
this complex type
             $RateAvailabilityReq = new stdClass();
             $RateAvailabilityReq->LRoomCode = new SoapVar($LRoomCode,
SOAP_ENC_OBJECT, "ArrayOfRoomType", "<your namespace url>");           
            $RateAvailabilityReq->idB2BHotel = $idB2BHotel;
             $RateAvailabilityReq->idProduct = $idProduct;
             $RateAvailabilityReq->lenght = $lenght;
            $RateAvailabilityReq->nameDistributor = $nameDistributor;
            $RateAvailabilityReq->password = $password;
            $RateAvailabilityReq->propertyCode = $propertyCode;           
             $RateAvailabilityReq->startDate = $startDate;
             $RateAvailabilityReq->userName = $userName;
             $RateUpdateReqType = new SoapVar($RateAvailabilityReq ,
SOAP_ENC_OBJECT, "RateAvailabilityReq", "<your namespace url>");
            
             $soapRequestType = new stdClass();
             $soapRequestType->in0 = $RateUpdateReqType;
             $getRateAvailabilityReq = new SoapVar($soapRequestType ,
SOAP_ENC_OBJECT, "getRateAvailability", "<your namespace url>");
            
             $result = $soapClient->getRateAvailability
($getRateAvailabilityReq);

Reading attributes from ComplexType response objects also required a custom
class added to the classmap array with the attribute as a member of the class.
===============================================================================

If you need to add attributes XML entities in your SOAP query like this:

"<FilterBy Column="Id" FilterOperator="=" FilterValue="NUMBER" Table="Case">"

Use SoapVar() with the type XSD_ANYXML as shown below.  Example uses __soapCall
and other SoapParams.

<?php
$response = $client->__soapCall('GetFilteredRecordList',
    array(new SoapParam($DSToken, 'Token'),
          new SoapParam('Slide', 'TableName'),
          new SoapVar('<FilterBy Column="Id" FilterOperator="=" FilterValue=
"NUMBER" Table="Case"/>', XSD_ANYXML)),
    array('soapaction' => 'http://www.example.com/webservices/
GetFilteredRecordList'));
?>

Use this so you don't waste HOURS looking around:

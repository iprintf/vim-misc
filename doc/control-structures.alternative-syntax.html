流程控制的替代语法

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

PHP 提供了一些流程控制的替代语法，包括 if，while，for，foreach 和 switch。替代
语法的基本形式是把左花括号（{）换成冒号（:），把右花括号（}）分别换成 endif;，
endwhile;，endfor;，endforeach; 以及 endswitch;。
<?php if ($a == 5): ?>
A is equal to 5
<?php endif; ?>

在上面的例子中，HTML 内容“A is equal to 5”用替代语法嵌套在 if 语句中。该 HTML
的内容仅在 $a 等于 5 时显示。

替代语法同样可以用在 else 和 elseif 中。下面是一个包括 elseif 和 else 的 if 结
构用替代语法格式写的例子：
<?php
if ($a == 5):
    echo "a equals 5";
    echo "...";
elseif ($a == 6):
    echo "a equals 6";
    echo "!!!";
else:
    echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
endif;
?>

    Note:

    不支持在同一个控制块内混合使用两种语法。

更多例子参见 while，for 和 if。

===============================================================================

It seems to me, that many people think that

<?php if ($a == 5): ?>
A ist gleich 5
<?php endif; ?>

is only with alternate syntax possible, but

<?php if ($a == 5){ ?>
A ist gleich 5
<?php }; ?>

is also possible.

alternate syntax makes the code only clearer and easyer to read
===============================================================================

A simple alternative to an if statement, which is almost like a ternary
operator, is the use of AND. Consider the following:

<?php
     $value = 'Jesus';

     // This is a simple if statement
     if( isset( $value ) )
     {
          print $value;
     }

     print '<br />';

     // This is an alternative
     isset( $value ) AND print( $value );
?>

This does not work with echo() for some reason. I find this extremely useful!
===============================================================================

isset( $value ) AND print( $value );

the reason why it doesn't work with echo, it's because echo does not return
anything, while print _always_ returns 1, which is considered true in the
expression
===============================================================================

If you wan't to use the alternative syntax for switch statements this won't
work:

<div>
<?php switch($variable): ?>
<?php case 1: ?>
<div>
Newspage
</div>
<?php break;?>
<?php case 2: ?>
</div>
Forum
<div>
<?php break;?>
<?php endswitch;?>
</div>

Instead you have to workaround like this:

<div>
<?php switch($variable):
case 1: ?>
<div>
Newspage
</div>
<?php break;?>
<?php case 2: ?>
</div>
Forum
<div>
<?php break;?>
<?php endswitch;?>
</div>
===============================================================================

If it needs saying, this alternative syntax is excellent for improving
legibility (for both PHP and HTML!) in situations where you have a mix of them.

Interface templates are very often in need of this, especially since the PHP
code in them is usually written by one person (who is more of a programmer) and
the HTML gets modified by another person (who is more of a web designer). Clear
separation in such cases is extremely useful.

See the default templates that come with WordPress 1.5+ (www.wordpress.org) for
practical and smart examples of this alternative syntax.
===============================================================================

The reason for the "workaround" jeremiah mentioned, in the case of the switch
statement, can be understood as follows; in any place where you can have an
echo statement (an if block, a switch's case, whatever), that's where you can
have the raw HTML. In PHP this basically gets handled just like that -- like an
echo statement.

In between a switch and a case, though, you can't echo anything. By placing the
switch and the case in two separate blocks of PHP, with a raw HTML newline
echo'ed in between them, PHP basically had to try to find where that statement
would be. And it can't be there, hence the difficulty.
===============================================================================

The reason temec987's approach of using boolean operators as an alternative to
control structures won't work for an 'echo' is because the result of evaluating
the expression will always be a boolean.

Other languages (e.g. ruby) are much better suited to this approach, as the
expression evaluated will be the resultant value, e.g.:
5 && 4

In ruby, this would be 4, but in PHP, this would be true (type-juggled
equivalent is 1), which isn't useful for anything but further binary logic.

You can still use logical operators as conditionals, but only for executing
logic, not for getting a value back, e.g.:
<?php
defined('USER_CAN_EXECUTE') or die('Access denied.');
?>

is a nice one to use for access control, or say you want to put in a quick
check that your object has all the data loaded it needs to call a webservice
(functions are just examples):
<?php
$this->readyForService() and $this->postData('http://endpoint.com');
?>

What you can't use them for is something like this:
<?php
echo (strlen($mystring) > 5) and $mystring;
?>

instead, you'd use ternaries for that:
<?php
echo (strlen($mystring) > 5) ? $mystring : null;
?>

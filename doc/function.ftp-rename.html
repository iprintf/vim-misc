You want to make sure you check the existence of the new name before renaming
files, because otherwise you could risk losing files. Just do a simple check
with ftp_size with the new name. If it's !=-1, you're going to want to throw
some kind of error, otherwise you'll be losing a file...
===============================================================================

to rename the file or folder you should use ftp_chdir to select the current
directory on ftp server or you should write the full path to file in old name
and in new name

Ex. 1
<?php
// open the folder that have the file
ftp_chdir($conn_id, '/www/ftp-filemanager/');

// rename the file
ftp_rename($conn_id, 'file1.jpg', 'new_name_4_file.jpg');
?>

or write full path Ex. 2
<?
// rename the file
ftp_rename($conn_id, '/www/ftp-filemanager/file1.jpg', '/www/ftp-filemanager/
new_name_4_file.jpg');
?>
===============================================================================

This function isn't only able to rename files, but also folders. And it is not
only able to rename them, but also move them, and, in the case of folders,
their contents as well (so folders don't have to be empty to move). For
example:

<?php
ftp_rename($conn_id, "./dir1/dir2/", "./dir3/");
?>

Now the folder dir2 (which prevously was in folder dir1) has moved to the same
folder as dir1, and it has kept its original contents (the content just moved
along).

bcpowmod

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

bcpowmod — Raise an arbitrary precision number to another, reduced by a
specified modulus

说明

string bcpowmod ( string $left_operand , string $right_operand , string
$modulus [, int $scale = 0 ] )

Use the fast-exponentiation method to raise left_operand to the power
right_operand with respect to the modulus modulus.

参数

left_operand

    The left operand, as a string.

right_operand

    The right operand, as a string.

modulus

    The modulus, as a string.

scale

    此可选参数用于设置结果中小数点后的小数位数。也可通过使用 bcscale() 来设置全
    局默认的小数位数，用于所有函数。

返回值

Returns the result as a string, or NULL if modulus is 0.

注释

    Note:

    Because this method uses the modulus operation, numbers which are not
    positive integers may give unexpected results.

范例

The following two statements are functionally identical. The bcpowmod() version
however, executes in less time and can accept larger parameters.
<?php
$a = bcpowmod($x, $y, $mod);

$b = bcmod(bcpow($x, $y), $mod);

// $a and $b are equal to each other.

?>

However, if you read his full note, you see this paragraph:
"The function bcpowmod(v, e, m) is supposedly equivalent to bcmod(bcpow(v, e),
m).  However, for the large numbers used as keys in the RSA algorithm, the
bcpow function generates a number so big as to overflow it.  For any exponent
greater than a few tens of thousands, bcpow overflows and returns 1."

So you still can, and should (over bcmod(bcpow(v, e), m) ), use his function if
you are using larger exponents, "any exponent greater than a few tens of
thousand."

Versions of PHP prior to 5 do not have bcpowmod in their repertoire.  This
routine simulates this function using bcdiv, bcmod and bcmul.  It is useful to
have bcpowmod available because it is commonly used to implement the RSA
algorithm.

The function bcpowmod(v, e, m) is supposedly equivalent to bcmod(bcpow(v, e),
m).  However, for the large numbers used as keys in the RSA algorithm, the
bcpow function generates a number so big as to overflow it.  For any exponent
greater than a few tens of thousands, bcpow overflows and returns 1.

This routine will iterate through a loop squaring the result, modulo the
modulus, for every one-bit in the exponent.  The exponent is shifted right by
one bit for each iteration.  When it has been reduced to zero, the calculation
ends.

This method may be slower than bcpowmod but at least it works.

function PowModSim($Value, $Exponent, $Modulus)
  {
  // Check if simulation is even necessary.
  if (function_exists("bcpowmod"))
    return (bcpowmod($Value, $Exponent, $Modulus));

  // Loop until the exponent is reduced to zero.
  $Result = "1";

  while (TRUE)
    {
    if (bcmod($Exponent, 2) == "1")
      $Result = bcmod(bcmul($Result, $Value), $Modulus);

    if (($Exponent = bcdiv($Exponent, 2)) == "0") break;

    $Value = bcmod(bcmul($Value, $Value), $Modulus);
    }

  return ($Result);
  }

I found a better way to emulate bcpowmod on PHP 4, which works with very big
numbers too:

function powmod($m,$e,$n) {
    if (intval(PHP_VERSION)>4) {
        return(bcpowmod($m,$e,$n));
    } else {
        $r="";
        while ($e!="0") {
            $t=bcmod($e,"4096");
            $r=substr("000000000000".decbin(intval($t)),-12).$r;
            $e=bcdiv($e,"4096");
        }
        $r=preg_replace("!^0+!","",$r);
        if ($r=="") $r="0";
        $m=bcmod($m,$n);
        $erb=strrev($r);
        $q="1";
        $a[0]=$m;
        for ($i=1;$i<strlen($erb);$i++) {
            $a[$i]=bcmod(bcmul($a[$i-1],$a[$i-1]),$n);
        }
        for ($i=0;$i<strlen($erb);$i++) {
            if ($erb[$i]=="1") {
                $q=bcmod(bcmul($q,$a[$i]),$n);
            }
        }
        return($q);
    }
}

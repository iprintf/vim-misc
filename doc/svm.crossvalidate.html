SVM::crossvalidate — Test training params on subsets of the training data.

说明

public float svm::crossvalidate ( array $problem , int $number_of_folds )

Crossvalidate can be used to test the effectiveness of the current parameter
set on a subset of the training data. Given a problem set and a n "folds", it
separates the problem set into n subsets, and the repeatedly trains on one
subset and tests on another. While the accuracy will generally be lower than a
SVM trained on the enter data set, the accuracy score returned should be
relatively useful, so it can be used to test different training parameters.

参数

problem

    The problem data. This can either be in the form of an array, the URL of an
    SVMLight formatted file, or a stream to an opened SVMLight formatted
    datasource.

number_of_folds

    The number of sets the data should be divided into and cross tested. A
    higher number means smaller training sets and less reliability. 5 is a good
    number to start with.

返回值

The correct percentage, expressed as a floating point number from 0-1. In the
case of NU_SVC or EPSILON_SVR kernels the mean squared error will returned
instead.

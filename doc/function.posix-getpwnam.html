(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

posix_getpwnam — Return info about a user by username

说明

array posix_getpwnam ( string $username )

Returns an array of information about the given user.

参数

username

    An alphanumeric username.

返回值

On success an array with the following elements is returned, else FALSE is
returned:

                          The user information array
Element                               Description
        The name element contains the username of the user. This is a short,
name    usually less than 16 character "handle" of the user, not the real, full
        name. This should be the same as the username parameter used when
        calling the function, and hence redundant.
        The passwd element contains the user's password in an encrypted format.
passwd  Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords, an
        asterisk is returned instead.
uid     User ID of the user in numeric form.
gid     The group ID of the user. Use the function posix_getgrgid() to resolve
        the group name and a list of its members.
        GECOS is an obsolete term that refers to the finger information field
        on a Honeywell batch processing system. The field, however, lives on,
gecos   and its contents have been formalized by POSIX. The field contains a
        comma separated list containing the user's full name, office phone,
        office number, and home phone number. On most systems, only the user's
        full name is available.
dir     This element contains the absolute path to the home directory of the
        user.
shell   The shell element contains the absolute path to the executable of the
        user's default shell.

范例

Example #1 Example use of posix_getpwnam()

<?php

$userinfo = posix_getpwnam("tom");

print_r($userinfo);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array
(
    [name]    => tom
    [passwd]  => x
    [uid]     => 10000
    [gid]     => 42
    [gecos]   => "tom,,,"
    [dir]     => "/home/tom"
    [shell]   => "/bin/bash"
)

If you need to validate a *real* unix password on a system using shadowed
passwords, the posix_getpwnam() function in PHP won't work (as mentioned, 'x',
or '*', will be in the password field).

I have a need to verify a user/pass within PHP (using SSL!).  I don't know if
this is the best way, but it's what I'm doing at the moment (works well!).

First, you need some help from the OS.  I wrote a tiny C utility that does the
shadow look-up for me... It requires root access to read /etc/shadow.  So after
you compile (gcc -O2 -s -o spasswd -lcrypt spasswd.c), you need to either use
sudo to run it, or

# chown root spasswd && chmod u+s spasswd

To code that I'm using to authenticate a user/pass from PHP looks like:

function Authenticate($realm)
{
global $PHP_AUTH_USER;
global $PHP_AUTH_PW;

if(!isset($PHP_AUTH_USER))
{
  header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"$realm\"");
  header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");

  return false;
}
else
{
  if(($fh = popen("/usr/sbin/spasswd", "w")))
  {
   fputs($fh, "$PHP_AUTH_USER $PHP_AUTH_PW");
   $r = pclose($fh);

   if(!$r)
    return true;
  }
}

header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"$realm\"");
header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");

return false;
}

The C source for spasswd.c:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <crypt.h>
#include <shadow.h>

static char salt[12], user[128], pass[128];

void die(void)
{
memset(salt, '\0', 12);
memset(user, '\0', 128);
memset(pass, '\0', 128);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
struct spwd *passwd;

atexit(die); die();

if(fscanf(stdin, "%127s %127s", user, pass) != 2)
  return 1;

if(!(passwd = getspnam(user)))
  return 1;

strncpy(salt, passwd->sp_pwdp, 11);
strncpy(pass, crypt(pass, salt), 127);

if(!strncmp(pass, passwd->sp_pwdp, 127))
  return 0;

return 1;
}

Hope this helps someone...

Oh I forgot the following:

to change a Users password via PHP,
you can use the following (under Linux with installed Samba):

exec('echo -e "'.$oldpassword.'\n'.$newpassword.'\n'.$newpassword.'
"|smbpasswd -U'.$user.' -s')

The exec-command returns ""
if an error occured (then see the error_log of the web-server)
or a message "The password has been changed".

Good luck.

Hello, I've tried another, more easier way to check passwords than checking it
to a pop3-server. If you are running a samba-server or a Windows PDC, so you
can try to connect with the username/password you want to check to the netlogon
of this server:

if (exec('echo "exit"|smbclient //server/netlogon -U'.$user.' '.$pass)=="") {
... }

If the username/password doesn't match, then the exec-command under LINUX
returns an error.

Good luck

If you are running a pop3-daemon, so you can do authentification on pop3 by
using fsockopen :-) and checking whether it returns +OK or -ERR
===============================================================================

For those of you who are writing daemons with PHP and are one for security.
This function will not return any info if you have called PHP's chroot()
function.

Took me a few minutes why it wouldn't find the user it was searching for.
===============================================================================

Given a non-existent username, this function returns a boolean FALSE.
===============================================================================

To check passwords on a Unix-box, look at the mod_auth_external module for
Apache, it uses external programs to do the real job. The server won't ever
read the encrypted password.

One of them, pwauth, can be configured to use PAM or whatever is used on your
system. Users that can run this program are configured at compile time. And
this program can be called from PHP with exec(...).
===============================================================================

I needed to get access to the user information to do login/validation via an
SSL connection and encountered the same problem with receiving '*' in the
password field.  After checking the documentation on posix_getpwnam, I saw a
previous solution involving coding a C program.  This was a bit bulky for me so
I came up with my own solution.

Variations on this theme can probably be done to make the solution more
programmer/reader friendly, but the way I did it accomplished the task that I
needed to do.

IF the information you need to get from posix_getpwnam comes from a host
participating in an NIS network, you can accomplish the same thing with the
following command:


$autharray = split(":",`ypmatch $USER passwd`);


(pretty long explanation for such a short solution huh?)

You'll have to get at the fields by their index number ($autharray[0],
$autharray[1], ...) using this method.

To create an associative array that is plug-in compatible with the
posix_getpwnam function,  you'll probably need to use the 'list' specifier to
do the assignments.

I hope this helps someone.

===============================================================================

User and group functions do not work on recent Redhat systems since these
functions are based on /etc/group file but new redhat does not put group
members' list into this file. Instead you need to examine /etc/passwd file and
find members of a group by checking group id.

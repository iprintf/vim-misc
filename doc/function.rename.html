Code first, then explanation.

<?php

rename ("/folder/file.ext", "newfile.ext");

?>

That doesn't rename the file within the folder, as you might assume, instead,
it moves the file to whatever the PHP working directory is... Chances are
you'll not find it in your FTP tree. Instead, use the following:

<?php

rename ("/folder/file.ext", "/folder/newfile.ext");

?>
===============================================================================

For those who are still confused about the behavior of rename() in Linux and
Windows (Windows XP) when target destination exists:

I have tested rename($oldName, $targetName) in PHP 5.3.0 and PHP 5.2.9 on both
OS and find that if a file named $targetName does exist before, it will be
overwritten with the content of $oldName
===============================================================================

Hello!
For unix/linux users: it is usefull to know that if you use rename() for a
directory, the new one will be created with the current umask!
===============================================================================

rename() is working on Linux/UNIX but not working on Windows on a directory
containing a file formerly opened within the same script. The problem persists
even after properly closing the file and flushing the buffer.

<?php
$fp = fopen ("./dir/ex.txt" , "r+");
$text = fread($fp, filesize("../dir/ex.txt"));
ftruncate($fp, 0);
$text2 = "some value";
fwrite ($fp,  $text2 );
fflush($fp);
fclose ($fp);
if (is_resource($fp))
    fclose($fp);
rename ("./dir", ".dir2"); // will give a «permission denied» error
?>

Strangely it seem that the rename command is  executed BEFORE the handle
closing on Windows.

Inserting a sleep() command before the renaming cures the problem.

<?php
$fp = fopen ("./dir/ex.txt" , "r+");
$text = fread($fp, filesize("../dir/ex.txt"));
ftruncate($fp, 0);
$text2 = "some value";
fwrite ($fp,  $text2 );
fflush($fp);
fclose ($fp);
if (is_resource($fp))
    fclose($fp);
sleep(1);    // this does the trick
rename ("./dir", ".dir2"); //no error
?>
===============================================================================

If by any chance you end up with something equivalent to this:

<?php
rename('/foo/bar','/foo/bar');
?>

It returns true. It's not documented.
===============================================================================

Note, that on Unix, a rename is a beautiful way of getting atomic updates to
files.

Just copy the old contents (if necessary), and write the new contents into a
new file, then rename over the original file.

Any processes reading from the file will continue to do so, any processes
trying to open the file while you're writing to it will get the old file
(because you'll be writing to a temp file), and there is no "intermediate" time
between there being a file, and there not being a file (or there being half a
file).

Oh, and this only works if you have the temp file and the destination file on
the same filesystem (eg. partition/hard-disk).
===============================================================================

rename() fails with PHP4 and PHP5 under Windows if the destination file exists,
regardless of file permission settings. I now use a function similar to that of
ddoyle [at] canadalawbook [dot] ca, which first tries rename(), checks if it
returned FALSE and then uses copy()/unlink() if it failed.

However, copy() is, unlike rename(), NOT useable for "atomic updates". Another
process may actually access the destination file while copy() is working. In
such a case, the other process with perceive the file as empty or with
incomplete content ("half written").
===============================================================================

As described from the unlink() page:
You have to release any handles to the file before you can rename it (True on
Windows, at least).
This will NOT work, you'll receive permission denied errors:
<?php
    $fileHand = fopen('tempFile.txt', 'r');
    rename( 'tempFile.txt', 'tempFile2.txt' ); // Permission Denied!
?>

Simply close the handle to fix this:
<?php
    $fileHand = fopen('tempFile.txt', 'r');
    fclose($fileHand);
    rename( 'tempFile.txt', 'tempFile2.txt' );
?>

This has me scratching my head for some time, as the handle was opened at the
top of a marge function, and the rename was at the bottom.
===============================================================================

If you use SplFileObject for the same file which
you want to rename you have to remove SplFileObject objec first.

<?php

$filePath = 'testFile.txt';
$fileObj = new SplFileObject(  $filePath  );
rename( $filePath, 'newName.txt'  );

// You will get - Permission denied error

$filePath = 'testFile.txt';
$fileObj = new SplFileObject( 'filePath.txt' );
$fileObj = null;
rename( $filePath, 'newName.txt'  );

// and now it is working.
?>
===============================================================================

From the Changelog notes:

"Warnings may be generated if the destination filesystem doesn't permit chown()
or chmod() system calls to be made on files — for example, if the destination
filesystem is a FAT filesystem."

More explicitly, rename() may still return (bool) true, despite the warnings
that result from the underlying calls to chown() or chmod(). This behavior can
be misleading absent a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics. To
rename across filesystems, PHP "fakes it" by calling copy(), unlink(), chown(),
and chmod() (not necessarily in that order). See PHP bug #50676 for more
information.

On UNIX-like operating systems, filesystems may be mounted with an explicit uid
and/or gid (for example, with mount options "uid=someuser,gid=somegroup").
Attempting to call rename() with such a destination filesystem will cause an
"Operation not permitted" warning, even though the file is indeed renamed and
rename() returns (bool) true.

This is not a bug. Either handle the warning as is appropriate to your
use-case, or call copy() and then unlink(), which will avoid the doomed calls
to chown() and chmod(), thereby eliminating the warning.
===============================================================================

I needed to move a file to another folder regardless if that file existed in
the target already so I wrote a small piece to append a unique number to each
file.

$rem = $_GET['file'];
$ticket = uniqid(rand(), true);

rename("$rem", "www/home/storefile/$ticket$rem");

the output looks like this - 6881432893ad4925a1.70147481filename.txt

This also helps if you want different versions of the file stored.
===============================================================================

Important note - rename() does NOT work for *directories* across filesystems or
devices. Only *files*

You will get two warnings:
"PHP Warning:  rename(): The first argument to copy() function cannot be a
directory in <whatever> on line <whatever>"
"PHP Warning:  rename(t2,/var/run/test/t2): Invalid cross-device link in
<whatever> on line <whatever>"

The copy() mentioned I assume is C's copy() and not PHP's copy() function.
There is an associated bug in the Ubuntu bug system for this as well, that was
escalated to bugs.php.net:
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54097

The only workarounds right now I believe is using PHP copy($source, $dest) and
then on success, PHP unlink($source), or doing system("mv $source $dest") which
is hokey, and should be surrounded by quotes for paths with spaces or other
shell metacharacters, and possibly escaped for security.
===============================================================================

Note that this WILL NOT WORK if trying to rename a directory to a network
share.

e.g.
rename('/home/user/me/dir1', '/mnt/shares/nfsmount/dir2')

will create a file called 'dir2' on the share and not a directory.

This caught me out and my (quickest) solution was to use an exec and mv
command:

<?php
$cmd = 'mv "/home/user/me/dir1" "/mnt/shares/nfsmount/dir2"';
exec($cmd, $output, $return_val);

if ($return_val == 0) {
   echo "success";
} else {
   echo "failed";
}
?>
===============================================================================

rename() definitely does not follow the *nix rename convention on WinXP with
PHP 5.  If the $newname exists, it will return FALSE and $oldname and $newname
will remain in their original state.  You can do something like this instead:

function rename_win($oldfile,$newfile) {
   if (!rename($oldfile,$newfile)) {
      if (copy ($oldfile,$newfile)) {
         unlink($oldfile);
         return TRUE;
      }
      return FALSE;
   }
   return TRUE;
}
===============================================================================

If $source is a valid folder, what do you think this does:

<?php
rename($source, '@');
?>

In 99% of the time you will get a warning, and $source remains untouched.

However, if you're working on Windows, and on a mapped network drive
occasionally $source will be moved to folder '@' which will be located at PHP's
working directory.

How about this:

<?php
rename($source, $source . '\folder1');
?>

This makes $source inaccessible.

Of course, it's stupid to move $source into a sub-folder like that. I'd expect
an error. Yet, no error or warning. And the script "freezes".

I had few instances where rename simply deleted files & folders. I have not
been able figure out why.

In a nut shell, be-careful when using rename.
===============================================================================

[Editor note: this works because SplFileObject has the __toString() method
which returns the file path]

Note that you can pass an SplFileInfo object as either argument:

<?php
# Assume a file 'foo' in the current directory

rename('foo', new SplFileInfo('bar'));

# foo is now bar!

rename(new SplFileInfo('bar'), 'foo');

# bar is now foo again
?>
===============================================================================

on windows (XP, vista, 7...) http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252", if
your file name contains accent, it doesn't work basically. So use iconv
function to convert from utf-8 to cp1252 as bellow :
<?php

$nomfichierinitial=iconv("UTF-8", "CP1252", "C:\\wamp\\www\\tést.txt");
$nomfichierfinal="C:\\wamp\\www\\test.txt";
rename($nomfichierinitial, $nomfichierfinal);
?>
===============================================================================

I could not get this to work at first, then saw that I was using a site url
constant ahead of my target folder/filename. After re-reading the example I
changed my constant to a filesystem type, like <?php rename( old_filename.ext, 
$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']"/target/folder/my_new_filename.ext"); ?> and it
worked like a charm.
===============================================================================

When I'm using unlink() or rename() with a SSH2.SFTP wrapper, both functions
always return FALSE (but without a warning) even on success.

Example:

$connection = ssh2_connect(SERVER_NAME, PORT);
ssh2_auth_password($connection, USERNAME, PASSWORD);
$sftp = ssh2_sftp($connection);

unlink("ssh2.sftp://$sftp/" . REMOTE_DIRECTORY . FILENAME); // returns FALSE on
success and on failure

rename("ssh2.sftp://$sftp/" . REMOTE_DIRECTORY . OLD_FILENAME, "ssh2.sftp://
$sftp/" . REMOTE_DIRECTORY . NEW_FILENAME); // returns FALSE on success and on
failure
===============================================================================

Actually, I'm pretty sure that rename follows the convention of *nix rename(2)
in overwriting the destination if it exists atomically (meaning that no other
process will see the destination cease to exist, even for an instant).  This is
useful because it allows you to build a file as a temp file, then rename it to
where you want it to be, and nobody sees the file when it's half done.

Probably rename($old, $new) with an existing new was caused by permission
problems.  I bet the other problems you had were the result of not calling
clearstatcache(), which can cause PHP to act like a file exists though it has
since been deleted.
===============================================================================

- rename extension of files

changeext($directory, $ext1, $ext2, $verbose)

i wrote this function to rename the extention of some files in a folder and
sub-folders inside it ..

parameter 1 :  the directory name
parameter 2 :  the first extention wich we want to replace
parameter 3 :  the new extention of files

for a simple usage call the function :
changeext('dir', 'html', 'php',  'false');

to change evry file name with extention html  into php  in the directory  dir

<?php

function changeext($directory, $ext1, $ext2, $verbose = false) {
  $num = 0;
  if($curdir = opendir($directory)) {
   while($file = readdir($curdir)) {
     if($file != '.' && $file != '..') {

       $srcfile = $directory . '/' . $file;
       $string  = "$file";
       $str     = strlen($ext1);
       $str++;
       $newfile = substr($string, 0, -$str);
       $newfile = $newfile.'.'.$ext2;
       $dstfile = $directory . '/' . $newfile;

       if (eregi("\.$ext1",$file)) { # Look at only files with a pre-defined
extension
       $fileHand = fopen($srcfile, 'r');
       fclose($fileHand);
       rename($srcfile, $dstfile );
       }

       if(is_dir($srcfile)) {
         $num += changeext($srcfile, $ext1, $ext2, $verbose);
       }
     }
   }
   closedir($curdir);
  }
  return $num;
}

changeext('dir', 'html', 'php',  'false');

?>

to remove the extention of files , just leave the parameter $ext2 blank ''
===============================================================================

This was a fun one-- on Win XP, rename throws a "permission deined" if you try
to rename across volumes.. i.e. rename("c:\windows\temp\x.txt", "g:\
destination") will fail.
===============================================================================

As of PHP 5.1.4 compiled on a mac, using rename with spaces one should just use
the space.   Take for example:

rename("/tmp/somefile.tar", "/mnt/laptop storage/somefile.tar");

If you use the backslash, like if you were cd-ing to the directory, rename will
fail.  Example:

rename("/tmp/somefile.tar", "/mnt/laptop\ storage/somefile.tar");

While not really a bug, it did confuse me for a little bit while working on a
backup script.
===============================================================================

It is unclear what encoding the arguments of rename should have; For PHP 4.3,
on a HFS+ filesystems, rename() did not handle UTF-8 strings, and returned an
error.
===============================================================================

To anyone wondering, rename($old, $new) returns FALSE if $new already exists. 
My script called for overwriting the file if it existed so I did this:

if(file_exists($new)) { unlink($new); }
$ok = rename($old, $new);

This did not work as expected.  If $new actually existed then it worked fine. 
That is the file found at path $new was deleted and replaced with the file
found at path $old.  However, if $new did NOT exist then the result was the
file at  path $old vanished into oblivion.  After debugging a bit, it seems
that rename() was getting executed before the if-statement.  So rename() moved
$old to $new, THEN the if-statement evaluated to true and deleted the file I
just moved.  Anyway, this fixed it:

if(file_exists($new)) {
    unlink($new);
    $ok = rename($old, $new);
} else { $ok = rename($old, $new); }

Very strange ... I hope this helps somebody
===============================================================================

I have programmed a really nice program that remotely lets you manage files as
if you have direct access to them (http://sourceforge.net/projects/filemanage/
). I have a bunch of really handy functions to do just about anything to files
or directories. In it I just finished redevloping the directory move function
to utilize PHP's rename() since it is way more efficient than a copy/delete
process. It goes through (recursivly) and renames all the files to a new
location instead of copying them. It recreates the directory structure in the
new location. It also allows you to overwrite the existing files, or not.
Here is the function I made; it will likely need tweaking to work as a
standalone script, since it relies of variables set by my program (eg: loc1 --
which dynamically changes in my program):

<?PHP
  // loc1 is the path on the computer to the base directory that may be moved
define('loc1', 'C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs', true);

  // move a directory and all subdirectories and files (recursive)
  // void dirmv( str 'source directory', str 'destination directory' [, bool
'overwrite existing files' [, str 'location within the directory (for recurse)
']] )
function dirmv($source, $dest, $overwrite = false, $funcloc = NULL){

  if(is_null($funcloc)){
    $dest .= '/' . strrev(substr(strrev($source), 0, strpos(strrev($source), '/
')));
    $funcloc = '/';
  }

  if(!is_dir(loc1 . $dest . $funcloc))
    mkdir(loc1 . $dest . $funcloc); // make subdirectory before subdirectory is
copied

  if($handle = opendir(loc1 . $source . $funcloc)){ // if the folder
exploration is sucsessful, continue
    while(false !== ($file = readdir($handle))){ // as long as storing the next
file to $file is successful, continue
      if($file != '.' && $file != '..'){
        $path  = $source . $funcloc . $file;
        $path2 = $dest . $funcloc . $file;

        if(is_file(loc1 . $path)){
          if(!is_file(loc1 . $path2)){
            if(!@rename(loc1 . $path, loc1 . $path2)){
              echo '<font color="red">File ('.$path.') could not be moved,
likely a permissions problem.</font>';
            }
          } elseif($overwrite){
            if(!@unlink(loc1 . $path2)){
              echo 'Unable to overwrite file ("'.$path2.'"), likely to be a
permissions problem.';
            } else
              if(!@rename(loc1 . $path, loc1 . $path2)){
                echo '<font color="red">File ('.$path.') could not be moved
while overwritting, likely a permissions problem.</font>';
              }
          }
        } elseif(is_dir(loc1 . $path)){
          dirmv($source, $dest, $overwrite, $funcloc . $file . '/'); //recurse!
          rmdir(loc1 . $path);
        }
      }
    }
    closedir($handle);
  }
} // end of dirmv()
?>

This new function will be in 0.9.7 (the next release of File Manage) which
should release sometime early February.
Hope this helps some people.

Remark for "php at stock-consulting dot com"'s note:
This depends on the operating system.
On windows-systems you can't rename a file to an existing destination (ok, with
tools you can - but they unlink the exisiting one before).

If you rename one directory to another where the second directory exists as an
empty directory it will not complain.

Not what I expected.

This code renames all  files and folders in a specific directory to lower case:

<?php
$path = "my_doc";

function getDirectory( $path = '.', $level = 0 ){

    $ignore = array( 'cgi-bin', '.', '..' );

    $dh = @opendir( $path );
   
    while( false !== ( $file = readdir( $dh ) ) )
    {
        if( !in_array( $file, $ignore ) )
        {
            $spaces = str_repeat( '&nbsp;', ( $level * 4 ) );
            if( is_dir( "$path/$file" ) )
            {
                echo "<strong>$spaces $file</strong><br />";
                rename($path."\\".$file, strtolower($path."\\".$file));
                getDirectory( "$path/$file", ($level+1) );
               
            }
            else {
                echo "$spaces $file<br />";
                rename($path."\\".$file, strtolower($path."\\".$file));
            }
        }  
    }
    closedir( $dh );
}

getDirectory( $path , 0 )

?>
===============================================================================

Interesting to note that if you are trying to rename a file within a folder
adding a slash in front of the folder (even if the folder is in the root of
your server) will not work.

in other words, if you have the folder "tmp" in your server's root:

<?php
rename("/tmp/tmp_file.txt", "/tmp/my_file.txt"); // will not work

rename("tmp/tmp_file.txt", "tmp/my_file.txt"); // WILL work!
?>
===============================================================================

Until recently you could end the dirname your wanted to rename to with a slash:

rename("mydir/my2nddir/","mydir/my3nddir/")

But now it doesn't work (php warns that it is unable to access mydir/my3nddir
/).

So always leave out a final slash in your dirname:

rename("mydir/my2nddir","mydir/my3nddir")

The same goes for mkdir().
===============================================================================

In Windows, on FAT32, rename will fail with "bad file descriptor" if the
underlying short (8.3) file name of the file to rename is the same as the new
file name. For example, attempting to rename "Oxygène.m3u" to "Oxygene.m3u"
will fail if the 8.3 name of "Oxygène.m3u" is "OXYGENE.M3U" (which is very
likely), as Windows will take both names as belonging to the same file. To
solve this you must first rename the file to an intermediate name and then
rename it to the intended name. To see the short (8.3) file names in a
directory you can type DIR /X on a cmd box.
===============================================================================

On WinXP/PHP 5+, not only does rename()  not follow the *nix rename as noted
below, but other things (do not) happen.  If you're trying to rename a
directory, files within the directory will NOT be present in the renamed
directory, though sub-directories WILL be present.  Ultra-strange.  And as
noted, your 'old' directory will remain on the server totally intact, which can
be very confusing.

To try and rename a folder on XP via PHP, I wound up using a workaround: first
i used the copydirr() function posted by makarenkoa at ukrpost dot net on the
"copy" page of the online manual to copy all folders and files within the
original directory to the new one... and then to delete the original directory
(and all files/folders beneath it), i used the delDir() function corrected by
czambran at gmail dot com on the "rmdir" page of the online manual.  Why didn't
I use unlink()?  Because, unlink does NOT work on Windows systems either (and
even if it did work, its not recursive without extra coding).

So, all in all, rename() is pretty much a useless function if you are intending
to rename a folder on an XP box.
===============================================================================

For those encountering the error:
No error in "path/to/script/file" at line XX

Check that the new filename (or both for safety) do not contain characters
forbidden by the system.

For example, forbidden characters in filenames on Windows:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx

Hope this helps!
===============================================================================

This is an update to the code provided by dev at islam-soft dot com, which
renames all files in a directory with a given extension to have a different
extension.

I updated four things: Most important, added a check to make sure the extension
matched ONLY the end of the filename (the original caused me a number of
headaches when it started matching things in the middle of filenames instead of
at the end where a proper extension belongs), 2nd added some feedback about
what is going on, if you choose verbose mode=TRUE, 3rd added the "testing"
parameter so you can do a test run before committing for real, 4th added an
error message if a rename fails.

parameter 1 :  the directory name
parameter 2 :  the first extension which we want to replace
parameter 3 :  the new extension of files
parameter 4 :  verbose? (true/false)
parameter 5 :  testing? (true/false)--if true, won't actually rename anything;
if you do verbose=TRUE and testing=TRUE you can see what will happen before
committing to it with testing=FALSE.

Return is the number of files renamed.

for a simple usage call the function :
changeext('my/directory', 'html', 'php',  false, false);

a simpler code for changing file extentions of multiple files in your working
directory.

$argv[2]\n");
        rename("$filename", substr($filename,0,-(strlen($argv[1])))."$argv[2]"
);
    }

exit("\nERROR: ARGUMENTS MISSING!\n\nChanges the extension of all files

You can always chdir() to the parent directory of what you're renaming, and
rename the directory or file directly.  For example:

$oldWD = getcwd();
chdir($dirWhereRenameeIs);
rename($oldFilename, $newFilename);
chdir($oldWD);

This might be a similar problem to what happened to:

Apparently rename() will fail on filenames that are too large and emit an
E_WARNING.

I was using rename() 'batch-move' a bunch of images. These files were lost in
translation; in other words: deleted. One file, however, was moved but the
filename was truncated. Weird. Why one or two files while the rest were
deleted. This was being attempted on a Windows box.

I hope this helps anyone. If anyone has an explanation please feel free to
email me. But if you're one of those idiots who *thinks* they're better than
everyone and you *think* you know everything, don't bother.

seems it's not true, because
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'rename(/tmp/
tables_new/#translit.csv,/home/crmdev/www/bpl-syrena/tables_new/#translit.csv):
Operation not permitted'

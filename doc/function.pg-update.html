pg_update

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_update — 更新表

说明

mixed pg_update ( resource $connection , string $table_name , array $data , 
array $condition [, int $options = PGSQL_DML_EXEC ] )

pg_update() 用 condition 作为条件查询数据库，用 data 中的数据更新符合条件的记录
。如果指定了 options，则 pg_convert() 会按照指定选项作用到 data 上。

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource.

table_name

    Name of the table into which to update rows.

data

    An array whose keys are field names in the table table_name, and whose
    values are what matched rows are to be updated to.

condition

    An array whose keys are field names in the table table_name, and whose
    values are the conditions that a row must meet to be updated.

options

    Any number of PGSQL_CONV_OPTS, PGSQL_DML_NO_CONV, PGSQL_DML_EXEC or
    PGSQL_DML_STRING combined. If PGSQL_DML_STRING is part of the options then
    query string is returned.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。 Returns string if PGSQL_DML_STRING is
passed via options.

范例

Example #1 pg_update() example

<?php 
  $db = pg_connect('dbname=foo');
  $data = array('field1'=>'AA', 'field2'=>'BB');
  
  // This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically
  $res = pg_update($db, 'post_log', $_POST, $data);
  if ($res) {
      echo "Data is updated: $res\n";
  } else {
      echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";
  }
?>

===============================================================================

Using pg_update() and pg_insert() without key validation is not secure!

You need to check which data pairs you get, and if you want to allow to updated
this column.

Example:

You have a table with tree colums: username, password, userlevel.

Your users may change only their username, and their password but not their
userlevel.

If you don't filter the keys in the request array, every user can now change
his userlevel just by sending a POST Request with "userlevel=>100".

So if you don't check if the key are allowed in your request array you'll get
serious sql injection vulnarabilities in your code.
===============================================================================

This function is similar to PEAR::DB's autoExecute() function, with the only
difference being that the where clause is an array instead of a string.

Also, if you want to use your instance of the DB class with this function, you
can reference the existing resource connection with $db->connection.

An example would be:
<?
     pg_update($db->connection, $arr_update, $arr_where);
?>

I have found in my copy of PHP (version 4.4.0) that if you use the
'PGSQL_DML_STRING' option, the function does not execute any query.  It merely
returns the query which would have been executed. 

Another thing I noticed, pg_update does not seem to make use of pg_trace
(atleast in 4.4.0).

PS this isn't a bug report, just an explanation of some undocumented features I
noticed.  As the manual says, the function is still in development so this
behaviour may differ from version to version.

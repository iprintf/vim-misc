odbc_free_result — Free resources associated with a result

bool odbc_free_result ( resource $result_id )

Free resources associated with a result.

odbc_free_result() only needs to be called if you are worried about using too
much memory while your script is running. All result memory will automatically
be freed when the script is finished.

参数

result_id

    The result identifier.

返回值

Always returns TRUE.

注释

    Note:

    If auto-commit is disabled (see odbc_autocommit()) and you call 
    odbc_free_result() before committing, all pending transactions are rolled
    back.

ps_setmiterlimit — Sets the miter limit

说明

bool ps_setmiterlimit ( resource $psdoc , float $value )

If two lines join in a small angle and the line join is set to
PS_LINEJOIN_MITER, then the resulting spike will be very long. The miter limit
is the maximum ratio of the miter length (the length of the spike) and the line
width.

参数

psdoc

    Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by ps_new().

value

    The maximum ratio between the miter length and the line width. Larger
    values (> 10) will result in very long spikes when two lines meet in a
    small angle. Keep the default unless you know what you are doing.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

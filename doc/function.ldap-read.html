ldap_read — Read an entry

说明

resource ldap_read ( resource $link_identifier , string $base_dn , string
$filter [, array $attributes [, int $attrsonly [, int $sizelimit [, int
$timelimit [, int $deref ]]]]] )

Performs the search for a specified filter on the directory with the scope
LDAP_SCOPE_BASE. So it is equivalent to reading an entry from the directory.

参数

link_identifier

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

base_dn

    The base DN for the directory.

filter

    An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all
    information for this entry, use a filter of objectClass=*. If you know
    which entry types are used on the directory server, you might use an
    appropriate filter such as objectClass=inetOrgPerson.

attributes

    An array of the required attributes, e.g. array("mail", "sn", "cn"). Note
    that the "dn" is always returned irrespective of which attributes types are
    requested.

    Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action (which
    is to return all attributes and their associated values). The use of this
    parameter should therefore be considered good practice.

attrsonly

    Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0 both
    attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the default
    behaviour.

sizelimit

    Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0 means
    no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

        Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than a
        preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate that
        it has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if you use
        this parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.

timelimit

    Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting this to
    0 means no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

deref

    Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search. It can be one of
    the following:
      □ LDAP_DEREF_NEVER - (default) aliases are never dereferenced.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be dereferenced during the search
        but not when locating the base object of the search.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be dereferenced when locating the
        base object but not during the search.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS - aliases should be dereferenced always.

返回值

Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.

===============================================================================

In the previous example the

$ds = ldap.myserver.com // your ldap server

should be

$ds = ldap_connect( "ldap.myserver.com" ) ; // your ldap server
===============================================================================

Clarification of the ldap_read command syntax: 

If you just want to pull certain attributes from an object and you already know
it's dn, the ldap_read command can do this as illustrated below.  It will be
less overhead than ldap_search.

The string base_dn which is normally used to set the top context for a
recursive ldap_search is used slightly differently with this command.  It is
used to specify the actual object with the full dn.  (Hopefully this saves
someone else a couple hours trying this command out.)

<?php
$ds = ldap.myserver.com // your ldap server
  $dn = "cn=username,o=My Company, c=US"; //the object itself instead of the
top search level as in ldap_search
  $filter="(objectclass=*)"; // this command requires some filter
  $justthese = array("ou", "sn", "givenname", "mail"); //the attributes to
pull, which is much more efficient than pulling all attributes if you don't do
this
      $sr=ldap_read($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);
          $entry = ldap_get_entries($ds, $sr);

echo $entry[0]["mail"][0] . "is the email address of the cn your requested";
echo $entry[0]["sn"][0] . "is the sn of the cn your requested";
ldap_close($ds);
?>

This prints out the specified users mail and surname for example.
===============================================================================

This differs from ldap_search() by not recursing down to sub-entries.  if you
know the dn of the item you're looking for and only want info on that entry,
use ldap_read() and pass it the full dn of the item you want.

It also seems that you'd alway want something like objectclass=* for the
filter, since you're only searching on one entry.
===============================================================================

The array in the attributes parameter needs to be an indexed array with numeric
keys in ascending order. Like this:

Array
(
    [0] => this
    [1] => is
    [2] => a
    [3] => test
)

If there are missing keys in the array, then no result will be returned. This
will not work:

Array
(
    [0] => this
    [1] => is
    [3] => test
)
===============================================================================

Unfortunately, userPasswords seem to be NOT retrievable with ldap_read();

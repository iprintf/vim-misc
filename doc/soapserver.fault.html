This function currently terminates execution as well, which may be undesirable.
See: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49513
===============================================================================

If you use Adobe Flex, Flash or AIR as SOAP client and are unable to get the
error message in case of a soap fault, upgrade to PHP 5.2.6.

hi,
to control the fault output one may do the following

/**
* mySoapServer class
*/
class mySoapServer extends SoapServer {
    public function __construct($wsdl, array $options = null) {
        parent::SoapServer($wsdl, $options);
    }
    public function fault ($code, $string, $actor = null, $details = null,
$name = null) {
        throw new SoapFault($code, $string, $actor, $details, $name);
    }
}

Use:
try {
    $server = new mySoapServer(null, array('uri' => $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']));
    $server->setClass('mySoapAPI');
    $server->handle();
} catch (SoapFault $exc) {
    echo $exc->getTraceAsString();
}

that how i did this,
hope iot can help some one.

This function also sends a 500 response code back to the client with the
request.
This was causing issues with an Apache Axis 1.2 client I had so I instead
implemented by own fault handling:

<?php
header("Content-Type: text/xml");
header("Status: 200");
die("<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/
envelope/\\">
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <SOAP-ENV:Fault>
      <faultcode>500</faultcode>
      <faultstring>".$ex->getMessage())."</faultstring>
    </SOAP-ENV:Fault>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>");
?>
===============================================================================

Example Usage:

return new SoapFault( "Client", "foo or bar must be supplied");

SOAP Fault Codes

VersionMismatch: Found an invalid namespace for the SOAP Envelope element
MustUnderstand    : An immediate child element of the Header element, with the
mustUnderstand attribute set to "1", was not understood
Client: The message was incorrectly formed or contained incorrect information
Server: There was a problem with the server so the message could not proceed

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

dbase_get_record_with_names — Gets a record from a database as an associative
array

说明

array dbase_get_record_with_names ( int $dbase_identifier , int $record_number
)

Gets a record from a dBase database as an associative array.

参数

dbase_identifier

    The database link identifier, returned by dbase_open() or dbase_create().

record_number

    The index of the record.

返回值

An associative array with the record. This will also include a key named
deleted which is set to 1 if the record has been marked for deletion (see 
dbase_delete_record()).

Each field is converted to the appropriate PHP type, except:

  • Dates are left as strings.
  • Integers that would have caused an overflow (> 32 bits) are returned as
    strings.

On error, dbase_get_record_with_names() will return FALSE.

范例

Example #1 Listing all the registered members in the database

<?php
// open in read-only mode
$db = dbase_open('/tmp/test.dbf', 0);

if ($db) {
  $record_numbers = dbase_numrecords($db);
  for ($i = 1; $i <= $record_numbers; $i++) {
      $row = dbase_get_record_with_names($db, $i);
      if ($row['ismember'] == 1) {
          echo "Member #$i: " . trim($row['name']) . "\n";
      }
  }
}
?>

===============================================================================

I would like to emphasize that record numbers begin with 1, not 0. So, this is
wrong:
<?php
$recCnt = dbase_numrecords($fh);
for ($recNum = 0; $recNum < $recCnt; $recNum++) {
    // wrong! first record will fail
    $record = dbase_get_record_with_names($fh, $recNum);
}
?>

This is right:

<?php
$recCnt = dbase_numrecords($fh);
for ($recNum = 1; $recNum <= $recCnt; $recNum++) {
    // right! record #s begin with 1, don't forget <=
    $record = dbase_get_record_with_names($fh, $recNum);
}
?>
===============================================================================

$foo_db = dbase_open ( 'foo.dbf', 0);

if ($foo_db) {
  $rn = dbase_numrecords($foo_db);

  echo "Record 0: ";
  $test = dbase_get_record_with_names($foo_db, 0);
  echo $test['deleted'] . " FOO BAR: '" . $test['BAR'] . "'\n";

  echo "Record n+1: ";
  $test = dbase_get_record_with_names($foo_db, $rn+1);
  echo $test['deleted'] . " FOO BAR: '" . $test['BAR'] . "'\n";

}

Gives:

Record 0: 0 FOO BAR: ' '

Record n+1:
Warning: Tried to read bad record 30 in ./DisplayAccounts.php on line 21
FOO BAR: ''

0 is not an error record, it's just empty - and actually, not quite empty, as
you see BAR got a single space.

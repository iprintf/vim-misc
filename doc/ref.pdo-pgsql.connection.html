PDO_PGSQL DSN — Connecting to PostgreSQL databases

说明

The PDO_PGSQL Data Source Name (DSN) is composed of the following elements,
delimited by spaces or semicolons:

DSN prefix

    The DSN prefix is pgsql:.

host

    The hostname on which the database server resides.

port

    The port on which the database server is running.

dbname

    The name of the database.

user

    The name of the user for the connection. If you specify the user name in
    the DSN, PDO ignores the value of the user name argument in the PDO
    constructor.

password

    The password of the user for the connection. If you specify the password in
    the DSN, PDO ignores the value of the password argument in the PDO
    constructor.

    Note:

    The bytea fields are returned as streams.

The following example shows a PDO_PGSQL DSN for connecting to a PostgreSQL
database:

pgsql:host=localhost;port=5432;dbname=testdb;user=bruce;password=mypass

You can also connect to PostgreSQL via a UNIX domain socket by leaving the host
empty.  This should have less overhead than using TCP e.g.:

$dbh = new PDO('pgsql:user=exampleuser dbname=exampledb password=examplepass');

In fact as the C library call PQconnectdb underlies this implementation, you
can supply anything that this library call would take - the "pgsql:" prefix
gets stripped off before PQconnectdb is called, and if you supply any of the
optional arguments (e.g. user), then these arguments will be added to the
string that you supplied...  Check the docs for your relevant PostgreSQL client
library: e.g.

http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/libpq-connect.html

If you really want, you can use ';'s to separate your arguments - these will
just be converted to spaces before PQconnectdb is called.

We can also alternatively put the username and password in the second and third
argument of PDO::__construct()
<?php
$dbh = new PDO("pgsql:dbname=$dbname;host=$host", $dbuser, $dbpass);
?>

I must say Chris C. is correct, yet sadly downvoted. It is irrelevant if
semicolons are converted to spaces in the DSN string. The entire point of PDO
is expressed in the first word of the acronym: "Portable"; it provides a
uniform way of accessing databases of various flavors, and since a semicolon is
its standard DSN delimiter, it SHOULD be used (at miniscule overhead if taking
conversion into account, mind you) to facilitate uniformity and potentially
ease portability.
===============================================================================

The PDO_PGSQL DSN should be seperated by semi-colons not spaces. It should
follow the convention like the rest of the PDO DSNs.

'pgsql:dbname=example;user=nobody;password=change_me;host=localhost'
===============================================================================

I wanted to point out something that is not obvious from the documentation here
or in any google searches that I've done.  Everything after the 'pgsql:' is
passed to the PQconnectdb function of the pgsql library as a connection
string.  This means 2 important key things:

1) 'username' is not a valid option of the PQconnectdb connection string.  Use
'user' instead (ie 'user=<username>' instead of 'username=<username>'). 
2) You can utilize ANY option of the PQconnectdb function in this way.  For
those trying to figure out how to enable ssl connections through the pgsql PDO
connection process, like me, as per Postgresql standards, the 'sslmode'
parameter can be set via the DSN.  So, for example, 'sslmode=require' will
require an ssl connection.  Look at the documentation for the pgsql library
version you are using for all options of both the sslmode parameter and any
other parameters that are available.
===============================================================================

The DSN syntax shown here did not work for me, but this did:

<?php
$dbh = new PDO("pgsql:dbname=$dbname;host=$host", $username, $password );
?>

As opposed to

<?php
$dbh = new PDO('pgsql:dbname=$dbname;
                           host=$host;
                           username=$username;
                           password=$password');
?>

Which makes sense and is more PGSQL standard.

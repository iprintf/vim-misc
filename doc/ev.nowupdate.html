(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

Ev::nowUpdate — Establishes the current time by querying the kernel, updating
the time returned by Ev::now in the progress.

说明

final public static void Ev::nowUpdate ( void )

Establishes the current time by querying the kernel, updating the time returned
by Ev::now() in the progress. This is a costly operation and is usually done
automatically within Ev::run() .

This method is rarely useful, but when some event callback runs for a very long
time without entering the event loop, updating libev 's consideration of the
current time is a good idea.

ini_set

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ini_set — 为一个配置选项设置值

说明

string ini_set ( string $varname , string $newvalue )

设置指定配置选项的值。这个选项会在脚本运行时保持新的值，并在脚本结束时恢复。

参数

varname

    不是所有有效的选项都能够用 ini_set() 来改变的。这里有个有效选项的清单附录。

newvalue

    选项新的值。

返回值

成功时返回旧的值，失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 设置一个 ini 选项

<?php
echo ini_get('display_errors');

if (!ini_get('display_errors')) {
    ini_set('display_errors', '1');
}

echo ini_get('display_errors');
?>

[[[Editors note: Yes, this is very true.  Same with
register_globals, magic_quotes_gpc and others.

Many settings, although they do get set, have no influence in your script....
like upload_max_filesize will get set but uploaded files are already passed to
your PHP script before the settings are changed.

Also other settings, set by ini_set(), may be to late because of this
(post_max_size etc.).
beware, try settings thru php.ini or .htaccess.
===============================================================================

If it's not your server and therefore you want to hide the data in your session
variables from other users, it�s very useful to set the session.save_handler in
your scripts to shared memory with:

<?php ini_set('session.save_handler','mm'); ?>

Remember: You have to set it in every script that uses the session variables
BEFORE "session_start()" or php won't find them.
===============================================================================

set PHP_INI_PERDIR settings in a .htaccess file with 'php_flag' like this:

php_flag register_globals off
php_flag magic_quotes_gpc on
===============================================================================

Note that this function only works with PHP_INI_ALL options!
===============================================================================

I figured out why php dont output errors such as an expected ';' on code and
output a 500 error. Some server are configured to omit php errors on pages
using the directive display_errors=Off;

In most cases, the server will output a 500 Internal Server Error instead of
php error because of it.

To prevent this default you must set this directive directly in the php.ini
file and the server will show you the php error properly. Setting ini_set
('display_errors', true) on-the-fly wont work.
===============================================================================

Be careful with setting an output_handler, as you can't use ini_set() to change
it. *sigh*

In my php.ini I have this for my web pages (and I want it):

  output_handler = ob_gzhandler

But this causes my command line scripts to not show output until the very end.

#!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php
ini_set('output_handler', 'mb_output_handler');
echo "\noutput_handler => " . ini_get('output_handler') . "\n";
?>

root@# ./myscript.php
output_handler => ob_gzhandler

Apparently (acording to Richard Lynch):

> TOO LATE!
> The ob_start() has already kicked in by this point.
> ob_flush() until there are no more buffers.
===============================================================================

To change settings from .htaccess files, it is also required that the directory
permissions configured in Apache allow this.

The <Directory /foo/bar> entry in httpd.conf MUST contain "AllowOverride All"
or at least "AllowOverride Options" to read PHP settings from the .htaccess
file.

E.g. in Fedora Core 2, the default settings for /var/www/html/ are
"AllowOverride None", so changing PHP settings via .htaccess for applications
installed below /var/www/html/ will not work.
===============================================================================

if u receive  an Error with generic like  :
Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded

if u set ini_set(max_execution_time, 300);
your problem will be solved
pls note that the 300 , is 300 seconds , which means 5 minute  you can set
another value !
===============================================================================

I have experienced on some systems that ini_set() will fail and return a false,
when trying to set a setting that was set inside php.ini inside a per-host
setting. Beware of this.
===============================================================================

Careful - in some cases, when setting zlib.output_compression to "On" via
ini_set, PHP won't send the Content-type header and browsers will garble the
output. Set it to the desired buffer size instead, which sends the correct
header:

<?php
ini_set("zlib.output_compression", 4096);
?>
===============================================================================

If you set something using php_admin_value in httpd.conf it is then not
possible to be set the value at runtime, even if it's NOT PHP_INI_SYSTEM.

Just an interesting note for Server admins this might come in handy to disable
setting of certain things... like allow_url_fopen.

When your ISP does not allow you to add the default include directories - it
might be useful to extend the 'include_path' variable:

<?php ini_set('include_path',ini_get('include_path').':../includes:');  ?>
===============================================================================

While this doesn't belong in the manual, it should be useful for people looking
on this page for zend_optimizer.* ini options, which are commonly installed:

Information on the "zend_optimizer.optimization_level" and
"zend_optimizer.enable_loader" options is available at:

http://www.zend.com/support/user_docs/ZendOptimizer/PDF/
ZendOptimizer_UserGuide.pdf
===============================================================================

Whilst most boolean settings can be disabled by passing '0', 'Off' or `No' (in
fact anything that is not '1', 'On' or 'Yes' - not case-sentive) to ini_set(),
it should be noted that ini_get() returns the literal string as set. So if you
later want to check this setting by calling ini_get() and it's been set to
'Off' (a non-empty string that evaluates to True), then you'll have to
specifically check for this in a (case-insensitive) string comparison, rather
than the simpler:

if (ini_get('config_setting')) { /* ... */ }

So, if you need to disable boolean settings I think it's preferable to set them
to '0' (which simply evaluates to False).
===============================================================================

To find the apache php settings try something like this.
> cd /etc/apache2
> grep -r -n -i  safe_mode_exec_dir *.conf
or
> grep -r -n -i safe_mode.*On *.conf

If you find a gererated file, obviously you need to find the source template
for it, to change what's needed there.

I just wasted a sunny Sunday on searching for where the heck safe_mode_exec_dir
was changed.

And yes, Local Value in phpinfo does mean 'changed between the php.ini file and
here', as you would think.

If you have an automated virtual host configuration, such as confixx, php ini
values can be spread across very many files.

They can be changed in apache config files, that can have any name, but usually
will end on .conf, besides in .htaccess files.
===============================================================================

[[[Editors note: Just because you're able to set something
doesn't mean it will work as expected.  Depends on the
setting.  For example. setting register_globals at
runtime will be of little use as its job has already
been completed by the time it reaches your script.

When a setting can not be changed in a user script, the return value of ini_set
is "empty", not "false" as you may expect.
If you check in your script for return value is "false" the script will
continue processing, although the setting has not been set.
The boolean return value is used for settings that can be changed in a script.
Otherwise the empty value is returned.
To test for both error conditions use:

<?php
if (empty($blnResult) or (!$blnResult)) {
   echo "setting cannot be set";
   exit;
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you use gz_handler you might want to switch over to
zlib.output_compression

This can be controlled via the ini_set control.

<?php ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'Off'); ?>

or

<?php ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 'On'); ?>

How to get xdebug var_dump to show full object/array regardless to php,ini
settings:

ini_set("xdebug.var_display_max_depth", -1);
ini_set("xdebug.var_display_max_children", -1);
ini_set("xdebug.var_display_max_data", -1);
var_dump($test);

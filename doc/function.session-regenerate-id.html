session_regenerate_id

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.2, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_regenerate_id — 使用新生成的会话 ID 更新现有会话 ID

说明

bool session_regenerate_id ([ bool $delete_old_session = false ] )

session_regenerate_id() 在不修改当前会话中数据的前提下使用新的 ID 替换原有会话
ID。

如果启用了 session.use_trans_sid 选项，那么必须在调用 session_regenerate_id()
函数之后开始进行输出工作，否则会导致使用原有的会话 ID。

参数

delete_old_session

    是否删除原 ID 所关联的会话存储文件。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
4.3.3 如果启用会话 cookie，调用 session_regenerate_id() 函数会使用新的会话 ID
      来生成 cookie 并发送给客户端。
5.1.0 加入 delete_old_session 参数。

In a previous note, php at 5mm de describes how to prevent session hijacking by
ensuring that the session id provided matches the HTTP_USER_AGENT and
REMOTE_ADDR fields that were present when the session id was first issued.  It
should be noted that HTTP_USER_AGENT is supplied by the client, and so can be
easily modified by a malicious user.  Also, the client IP addresses can be
spoofed, although that's a bit more difficult.  Care should be taken when
relying on the session for authentication.
===============================================================================

Session_destroy() does not only destroy the data associated with the current
session_id (i.e. the file if you use the default session save handler), but
also the session itself: if you call session_destroy() and then
session_regenerate_id(), it will return false, and session_id() won't return
anything. In order to manipulate a session after destroying it, you need to
restart it.

So in fact, the code mentionned by chris won't work. If you want to destroy the
file associated with the old session_id, try the following:
<?php
session_start();
$old_sessid = session_id();
session_regenerate_id();
$new_sessid = session_id();
session_id($old_sessid);
session_destroy();

//If you don't copy the $_SESSION array, you won't be able to use the data
associated with the old session id.
$old_session = $_SESSION;
session_id($new_sessid);
session_start();
$_SESSION = $old_session;
//...
?>

Note: this technique will send 3 Set-Cookie headers (one on each session_start
() and one on session_regenerate_id()). I don't think this is a problem, but if
it appears to be one, you could either leave it alone and wait for the garbage
collector to catch the file associated with the old session, or try to delete
the file with unlink().
===============================================================================

I wrote the following code for a project I'm working on- it attempts to resolve
the regenerate issue, as well as deal with a couple of other session related
things.

I tried to make it a little more generic and usable (for instance, in the full
version it throws different types of exceptions for the different types of
session issues), so hopefully someone might find it useful.

<?php
function regenerateSession($reload = false)
{
    // This token is used by forms to prevent cross site forgery attempts
    if(!isset($_SESSION['nonce']) || $reload)
        $_SESSION['nonce'] = md5(microtime(true));

    if(!isset($_SESSION['IPaddress']) || $reload)
        $_SESSION['IPaddress'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

    if(!isset($_SESSION['userAgent']) || $reload)
        $_SESSION['userAgent'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];

    //$_SESSION['user_id'] = $this->user->getId();

    // Set current session to expire in 1 minute
    $_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] = true;
    $_SESSION['EXPIRES'] = time() + 60;

    // Create new session without destroying the old one
    session_regenerate_id(false);

    // Grab current session ID and close both sessions to allow other scripts
to use them
    $newSession = session_id();
    session_write_close();

    // Set session ID to the new one, and start it back up again
    session_id($newSession);
    session_start();

    // Don't want this one to expire
    unset($_SESSION['OBSOLETE']);
    unset($_SESSION['EXPIRES']);
}

function checkSession()
{
    try{
        if($_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] && ($_SESSION['EXPIRES'] < time()))
            throw new Exception('Attempt to use expired session.');

        if(!is_numeric($_SESSION['user_id']))
            throw new Exception('No session started.');

        if($_SESSION['IPaddress'] != $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])
            throw new Exception('IP Address mixmatch (possible session
hijacking attempt).');

        if($_SESSION['userAgent'] != $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])
            throw new Exception('Useragent mixmatch (possible session hijacking
attempt).');

        if(!$this->loadUser($_SESSION['user_id']))
            throw new Exception('Attempted to log in user that does not exist
with ID: ' . $_SESSION['user_id']);

        if(!$_SESSION['OBSOLETE'] && mt_rand(1, 100) == 1)
        {
            $this->regenerateSession();
        }

        return true;

    }catch(Exception $e){
        return false;
    }
}

?>
===============================================================================

Also note that REMOTE_ADDR may change on every request if the user comes
through a proxy farm. Most AOL-users do.
===============================================================================

`session_regenerate_id` sends a new cookie but doesn't overwrite the value
stored in `$_COOKIE`. After calling `session_destroy`, the open session ID is
discarded, so simply restarting the session with `session_start` (as done in
Ben Johnson's code) will re-open the original, though now empty, session for
the current request (subsequent requests will use the new session ID). Instead
of `session_destroy`+`session_start`, use the `$delete_old_session` parameter
to `session_regenerate_id` to delete the previous session data.

<?php
session_start();
/* Create a new session, deleting the previous session data. */
session_regenerate_id(TRUE);
/* erase data carried over from previous session */
$_SESSION=array();
?>

To start a new session and leave the old untouched, simply leave out the
argument to `session_regenerate_id`.
===============================================================================

I wrote the current top voted comment on this and wanted to add something. The
existing code from my previous comment generates it's nonces in an insecure
way-

<?php
$_SESSION['nonce'] = md5(microtime(true));
?>

Since "microtime" is predictable it makes brute forcing the nonce much easier.
A better option would be something that utilizes randomness, such as-

<?php
bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32))
?>
===============================================================================

as far as I have understood reading this online notes,

session_name() is the name which is identified as session a through the cookies
or http links.

session_id is  like a transaction within a session_name() and one session_name
may have many session_id

each session_id has the corresponding data stored.

session_id are used in read and write callback under a session_name

whatever it is, first call the
session_name(), 
then call session_id ()
and then call start_session()

start_session will open the session_name, then check the session_id called
before and use it in the read or write call back for storing or retrieving data

calling start_session() without session_name or session_id will use the default
session_name and the default session_id in that order

I hope if the order is followed there should not be any problems.

do not call session_name or session_id after start_session(), if you are
specific on using them.

thank you for others note.
===============================================================================

To add to php at 5mm de's comments:

If the session is held over https, it's even better to save the client's cert
or ssl session id instead of the hostname or ip, as it's proxy-transparent and
more secure.
===============================================================================

I had problems with a proxy changing a visitors session_id-cookie, so he'd get
a LOT of errors when visiting my site.
I handled the bogus session-id's like this. (Note: It only works in versions >
4.3.2.)

<?php
// Start a session and suppress error-messages.
@session_start();

// Catch bogus session-id's.
if (!preg_match("/^[0-9a-z]*$/i", session_id())) {

    // Output a warning about the messed up session-id.
    $error->handleError("WARN", "Your session id is messed up, you might not be
able to use some features on this site.");

    // Generate a fresh session-id.
    session_regenerate_id();
}

// Site contents.
?>

Hope someone can use it.
===============================================================================

If you are trying to maintain 2 active sessions don't use session_regenerate_id
().  Especially if the first session is closed and it's time to open the
second.  Because the session id is cached you also have to explicitly set it
the second time.

<?php
session_name('PHPSESSID'); // redundant - here for clarity
session_start();
// ...do stuff
session_write_close();

// now switch to session 2...
session_name('PHPSESSID_2');
if (isset($_COOKIE['phpsessid_2']))
    session_id($_COOKIE['phpsessid_2']); // not doing this will simply reopen
the first session again
else
    session_id(sha1(mt_rand()); // dont use session_regenerate_id() here.  Not
creating a new id will create two cookies with same session id and same session
variables
session_start();
// ... do stuff with session 2
session_write_close();
?>
===============================================================================

This can be a very dangerous function if you're not careful about how you
handle things, because even though it generates a whole new set of session
data, it keeps the old data "open" until the script terminates, locking out any
other scripts trying to run concurrently with the old session id.

Recently I came across a situation where I wanted to explicitly pass in a
session ID, copy the data from that session into a *new* session, and then
continue operating under that new session, thereby allowing other scripts to
use the old one concurrently. But I quickly found that these "other scripts"
would not execute until the first script finished--even though it had already
started a new session--because it kept the old session open.

So if you're trying to copy over session data to a new session to free up the
old session for continued, concurrent use, here's some code to ensure nobody's
feet get stepped on:

<?php

//  get session id of an existing session
$sid = $_GET['sid'];

//  start the old session to retrieve $_SESSION data
session_id($sid);
session_start();

//  start a new session; this copies the $_SESSION data over
session_regenerate_id();

//  hang on to the new session id
$sid = session_id();

//  close the old and new sessions
session_write_close();

//  re-open the new session
session_id($sid);
session_start();

/* main code here */

?>

This could probably be encapsulated into a function with one parameter as well
to save space if it was a repeated thing.
===============================================================================

In PHP 5.6 (and probably older versions), session_regenerate_id(true) do not
trigger a read() call to the session handler for the new session id.

In PHP 7, read() is triggered during session_regenerate_id(true). Nice to know
when working with custom session handlers.
===============================================================================

Take good notice of the new cookie being sent on calling session_regenerate_id
on cookie-enabled sessions.
Make sure your page is reloaded otherwise you'll get an "session_destroy():
Session object destruction failed" error. So here are the examples:

Wrong:
<?php
    session_start();
    session_regenerate_id();
    session_destroy();
?>

Correct-like:
<?php
if (!$_GET['mode']){
    session_start();
    session_regenerate_id();
    header('location: '.$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'].'?mode=destroy');
} else {
    session_start();
    session_destroy();
}
?>

I noted this because googleing on the previous mentioned error leads to all
kinds of bug reports, but not to the solution. (which is, of course, to read
the manual)
===============================================================================

There could be a potential problem with elger at NOSPAM dot yellowbee dot nl's
a few posts below. In the code, was used the REQUEST_URI server variable,
which, in some cases might already contain the query string. Therefore, always
apending '?whatever=foo' would occasionally cause the script to malfunction. I
suggest using PHP_SELF, which will not contain the query string after the file.
===============================================================================

By inspecting the source code, I am not sure that after session_regenerate_id()
run, the original session data does not destroy (still keeps at the system)
that sniffers still hijack by applying original session identifier.

In addition, I find that if user-level session storage handler is used.
session_regenerate_id() does not work.
===============================================================================

This feature seems to create a new session ID without clearing the old session
data. This is a very important feature for security validation:

$usedns = TRUE; // for eliminating failture by proxys using IP chains, but
slower

$useragent = getenv("HTTP_USER_AGENT");
$host = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");
$dns = $global['dns'] ? @gethostbyaddr($host):$host;

session_start();

if(session_is_registered('securitycheck')) {
    if(
            (($_SESSION['session']['host'] != $this->host) && !$usedns)
         || ($_SESSION['session']['dns'] != $this->dns)
         || ($_SESSION['session']['useragent'] != $this->useragent)
    ) {
        session_regenerate_id();
        session_unset();
    }
} else {
    $currentdata = array();
    $currentdata['host'] = $this->host;
    $currentdata['dns'] = $this->dns;
    $currentdata['useragent'] = $this->useragent;
   
    session_register('securitycheck', $currentdata);
}

If sombody steals an active SID (e.g. by referrer or injection attack), he can 
t be validated because of either the host / dns or useragent and will get a new
(empty) SID, without interrupting the original session.

If you are storing your session data in a database you have to manually update
the session_id in the database. The session_set_save_handler() will not do it
for you.

function UpdateSessID() {
    $old_sess_id = session_id();
    session_regenerate_id(false);
    $new_sess_id = session_id();
       
    $query = "UPDATE `session_table` SET `session_id` = '$new_sess_id' WHERE
session_id = '$old_sess_id'";
        mysql_query($query);
}

Be sure to set session_regenerate_id() to FALSE since it's not really necessary
to delete the whole record from MySQL and add it again. That's unnecessary
overhead. Only changing the id matters.

A note on lost sessions and trying to fix it with session_regenerate_id:
Make sure that you're not trying to push SimpleXML object to the session. It
just won't go without first converting it to array. :)
===============================================================================

licp - no, session_regenerate_id() does not destroy any saved session data.

elger, I prefer the following order

[code]
// populate $_SESSION with any previously saved session data for the current
session_id
session_start(); 
...
// delete any saved data associated with current session_id, $_SESSION is not
changed
session_destroy();

// change session_id, $_SESSION not altered
session_regenerate_id();
...
// save any $_SESSION data under the current session_id
session_close();
[/code]
===============================================================================

This function is vital in preventing session fixation attacks, but is
unfortunately missing in PHP versions prior to 4.3.2. This creates a serious
security problem if you can't update your PHP version, like me. Therefore I
attempted to port this function to PHP itself:

<?php
    if (!function_exists('session_regenerate_id')) {
        function php_combined_lcg() {
            $tv = gettimeofday();
            $lcg['s1'] = $tv['sec'] ^ (~$tv['usec']);
            $lcg['s2'] = posix_getpid();

            $q = (int) ($lcg['s1'] / 53668);
            $lcg['s1'] = (int) (40014 * ($lcg['s1'] - 53668 * $q) - 12211 * $q
);
            if ($lcg['s1'] < 0)
                $lcg['s1'] += 2147483563;

            $q = (int) ($lcg['s2'] / 52774);
            $lcg['s2'] = (int) (40692 * ($lcg['s2'] - 52774 * $q) - 3791 * $q);
            if ($lcg['s2'] < 0)
                $lcg['s2'] += 2147483399;

            $z = (int) ($lcg['s1'] - $lcg['s2']);
            if ($z < 1) {
                $z += 2147483562;
            }

            return $z * 4.656613e-10;
        }

        function session_regenerate_id() {
            $tv = gettimeofday();
            $buf = sprintf("%.15s%ld%ld%0.8f", $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $tv[
'sec'], $tv['usec'], php_combined_lcg() * 10);
            session_id(md5($buf));
            if (ini_get('session.use_cookies'))
                setcookie('PHPSESSID', session_id(), NULL, '/');
            return TRUE;
        }
    }
?>

To test this:
<?php
    session_start();
    $sid = session_id();
    session_regenerate_id();
    echo "Old session ID: ", $sid, "\nNew session ID: ", session_id(), "\n";
?>

- will output something similar to:
Old session ID: 6e3521f44be4fc452b368e703f044ca1
New session ID: 1c6dac9a3e794f164d4115872b902471
===============================================================================

I am calling session_regenerate_id() from inside a method in an object.  Since
session fixation can occur at permission changes, I have my object call session
fixation at these particular security changes.

Unfortunately, it seems to fabricate some kind of temporary new session, and
then the very next page that loads, it jumps back to the old session id.  There
seems to be no way to make the regeneration perminent.
===============================================================================

To "start a new session", try the following:

<?php
session_start();
session_regenerate_id();
session_destroy();
unset($_SESSION);
session_start();
?>
===============================================================================

It would be more reliable to use the following regular expression when checking
session_ids, as HEX strings (MD5) are only of characters a-f and 0-9;

preg_match('/[0-f]/i', $session_id);

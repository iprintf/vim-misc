===============================================================================

The behavior of persistent connections is somewhat mysterious, but it appears
that they remain for the duration of the process with some internal timeout
value, and not until the end of script execution as you might expect based on
the wording here and in close().

That is, the connection will remain open even once every object that used it is
out of scope and can be accessed again with the persist key. This is consistent
with the way e.g. DBI does things, but still somewhat confusing when not made
explicit. A related issue is that under certain conditions php seems to open
multiple connections even using the same key, but that's more of a bug report.
===============================================================================

you can set mongo.auto_reconnect=1 in php.ini to cause it to automatically
reconnect. This might be the default in future versions
===============================================================================

This is my coding sample
new Mongo();
new Mongo('mongodb://localhost:27017');
when I tried the two above,My page throw an exception with ' operation now in
progress '
then I changed the localhost to ip address
new Mongo('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017');
It works well!
===============================================================================

Note that even if you authenticate with a database specific user during
instantiation of the Mongo class, it's still necessary to select the database
before you try and use it.

Might sound common sense, but hopefully it will help someone anyway :D

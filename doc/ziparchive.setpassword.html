===============================================================================

Wouldn't it make sense for this method to be named ZipArchive::usePassword,
instead?  There seems to be a lot of people thinking that its name, currently
(ZipArchive::setPassword), is for applying a password.  I think nomenclature
should certainly be up for discussion on this method.
===============================================================================

It seems that this function supports only decryption of password protected
archives (see changelog: http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=zip
). Creation of password protected archives is not supported (they will be
created simply as non-protected archives).

Example code for extraction of files from password protected ZIP archives:

<?php
    $zip = new ZipArchive();
    $zip_status = $zip->open("test.zip");

    if ($zip_status === true)
    {
        if ($zip->setPassword("MySecretPassword"))
        {
            if (!$zip->extractTo(__DIR__))
                echo "Extraction failed (wrong password?)";
        }

        $zip->close();
    }
    else
    {
        die("Failed opening archive: ". @$zip->getStatusString() . " (code: ". 
$zip_status .")");
    }
?>
===============================================================================

As noted earlier  the  method does not actually set a  password. It enters the
password to allow decryption of the archive for reading.

It  does not:

1) create an encrypted archive
2) allow the addition of encrypted files to the archive
3) read  AES256 encryption/compression
4) throw catchable errors use $zip->getStatusString()

Hopefully someone will get around to fixing the doc to reflect all of this.
===============================================================================

$zip = new ZipArchive();
$code = $zip->open('myzip.zip', ZipArchive::CREATE | ZipArchive::OVERWRITE);
    if ($code === true)
        echo 'zip opened<br>';
    else
        echo $code.'<br>';
    $zip->addFile('somefile');

    $code = $zip->setPassword('secret');

    if ($code === true)
        echo 'password set<br>';
    else
        echo $code.'<br>';

    $code = $zip->close();
    if ($code === true)
        echo 'closed<br>';
    else
        echo $code.'<br>';

    echo 'done<br>';

this prints:

zip opened
password set
closed
done

on the filesystem, the myzip.zip is created with somefile inside but the zip
file is not password protected.

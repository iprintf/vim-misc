imageinterlace

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

imageinterlace — 激活或禁止隔行扫描

说明

int imageinterlace ( resource $image [, int $interlace ] )

imageinterlace() 打开或关闭隔行扫描的比特标记。如果 interlace 为 1 则图像为隔行
扫描的，如果 interlace 为 0 则图像为非隔行扫描的。

如果设定了隔行扫描比特标记而图像使用 JPEG 格式，则图像被创建为渐进式 JPEG。

本函数返回图像中是否设定了隔行扫描比特标记。

dr_snapid's comment that "the server sends every Nth line" is not entirely
true. A web server need not know anything about the contents of the file it is
sending; its job is simply to send the data. Rather, the image is created in
such a way that the data corresponding to "every Nth line" appears at the
beginning of the file, with the details becoming able to be filled in as more
of the file is received by the browser. In PHP's case, the data may have been
generated dynamically instead of pulled from a file, but this does not change
the fact that it is the data itself that is different, not the manner in which
it is sent.*

In fact, with JPEG, it is less "every Nth line", and more "every Nth pixel",
where N is gradually decreased, resulting in a grid that gets progressively
more fine-grained as the data is received (hence the appearance of a low res
image becoming more detailed). The browser basically estimates what goes in the
gaps between pixels, probably by simply blending between the colours, whilst
the "real" data continues arriving. This is a fundamentally different method
for encoding the data when compared to non-progressive JPEGs, and coupled with
the format's other compression techniques, may indeed result in a different
file size.

*Can you imagine how much more buggy the Web would be if servers were expected
to send different file types using different algorithms, and browsers were
expected to be able to receive every one of them?

It was suggested that this function can be used to retrieve the interlace bit
of an image that is stored in a file. This is not the case.
While imageinterlace() returns 0 or 1 if a valid Image resource is passed,
passing a file name as a string results in a PHP warning and the return value
is neither 0 nor 1.
===============================================================================

just to add my 5 cents on the progressive principle of jpeg: there are no
several lowres images stored in jpeg along with original picture, the only
thing altered is the order of "pixels". in jpeg the image is divided in areas
8x8 pixels, so instead of linear order of pixels (row-by-row), first there is
one pixel form each 8x8 area included in the begining of the image data stream,
so when the browser recieves all 8x8 area pixels, it can display "pixelate"
image and as soon as it recieves more data, the browser can add more pixels and
"sharpen" the image.

About MichaelSoft's note "Imageinterlace($im, 1) creates a JPG which is first
loaded completely before showing anything":

Actually, that's not completely true.
This only happens with Internet Explorer (any version, for the time being) as
it doesn't seem to support progressive displaying and rather shows the image,
when it's 100% done with loading. Other browsers (Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, Konqueror, etc.) do their job as they're supposed to do: Displaying a
very low-res image, then overlaying a midlow-res image (while loading), and
then displaying more and more details.
===============================================================================

This function is useful when working with Ming, as SWFBitmap constructor will
use a NON INTERLACED Jpeg file, so you have to use imageinterlace(0);
===============================================================================

Set imageinterlace() to 0 if you need to load the generated images in Flash.
Flash does not support progressive JPEGs
===============================================================================

Using the interlace-option reduces the filesize! (doesnt really match with the
idea that an additional low-res-image is stored)
===============================================================================

Interlacing doesnt store another image, it simple changes the order in which
the images lines are sent and rendered. The server sends every Nth line,
reaches the end, then goes back to the start, reading the lines in between.

After each pass the browser displays the downloaded lines, plus filles the
lines not yet received the same, but with each pass the gaps being filled get
smaller and the image sharpens. After several passes every line has been read,
and the browser has rendered the image in full detail.

Hope that makes sense, it does explain why there should not really be any
difference in filesize, so I cant explain why some people have observed a file
size difference.

As I understand it, there is only 1 bit in the file which says if its
interlaced or not, and the server and client (browser) just handle it
differently if it is set to 1.
===============================================================================

Interlancing works also with PNG files but it increase filesize (from 14.4M to
17.7M).
===============================================================================

There is a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer (at least at present) that means
that often, a progressive/interlaced JPEG will actually NOT show at all whilst
loading, suddenly appearing only when the entire picture has loaded. A regular
NON-interlaced/NON-progressive JPEG will display line by line as it loads,
which paradoxically gives the illusion that it's loading faster. MSIE
definitely has this one backwards!!

This behaviour is not apparent in other browsers such as Mozilla/FireFox - in
these browsers, the image loads progressively, as it should.

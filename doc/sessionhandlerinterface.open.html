===============================================================================

The suggestion that you should free the lock as soon as possible is WRONG (and
for some reason, I can't downvote it right now).

Releasing the lock before the write() call is as effective as not using locks
at all. The whole point is that a concurrent read() HAS to be blocked until the
session is closed, otherwise you'll have race conditions.

If you care about the performance aspect, you should take care to call
session_write_close() as soon as possible instead.
===============================================================================

You should lock your program for as shorter as possible. Lock it straight
before read/write operation and unlock it just after this operation. Otherwise
you will face with perfomance degradation and even lock your program at all.

Example.
You bind your session to db. Your open method opens the db connection and locks
it. No other parallel requests will not be possible until the hole request to
your site will be finished (and session close will be called)

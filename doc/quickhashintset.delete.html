    The key of the entry to delete.

返回值

TRUE when the entry was deleted, and FALSE if the entry was not deleted.

范例

Example #1 QuickHashIntSet::delete() example

<?php
$set = new QuickHashIntSet( 1024 );
var_dump( $set->exists( 4 ) );
var_dump( $set->add( 4 ) );
var_dump( $set->delete( 4 ) );
var_dump( $set->exists( 4 ) );
var_dump( $set->delete( 4 ) );
?>

fann_train_epoch — Train one epoch with a set of training data

说明

float fann_train_epoch ( resource $ann , resource $data )

Train one epoch with the training data stored in data. One epoch is where all
of the training data is considered exactly once.

This function returns the MSE error as it is calculated either before or during
the actual training. This is not the actual MSE after the training epoch, but
since calculating this will require to go through the entire training set once
more. It is more than adequate to use this value during training.

The training algorithm used by this function is chosen by 
fann_set_training_algorithm() function.

参数

ann

    Neural network resource.

data

    Neural network training data resource.

返回值

The MSE, or FALSE on error.

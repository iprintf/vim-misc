I am quite surprised about previous posts. Here are my advices:

1/ prefer the count() function instead of sizeOf() as sizeOf() is only an alias
of count() and does not mean the same in many other languages based on C (avoid
ambiguity).

2/ prefer the powerful forEach() function to iterate over arrays.
===============================================================================

I would recommend not using sizeof(). Many programmers expect sizeof() to
return the amount of memory allocated. Instead sizeof() -as described above- is
an alias for count().

Prevent misinterpretation and use count() instead.
===============================================================================

a) Always try and use PHP's internal routines to iterate through objects of
various types (arrays in most examples below).

Instead of interpreting your code to loop through them, they use their own
internal routines which are much faster.

(This is why foreach () will run faster than manual interation)

b) It is _always_ good practice to leave as many static resulting functions
outside of loops, having operations that return the exact same piece of data
every iteration of the loop is not pretty on resources.

c) I agree with PixEye's remarks on sizeof().  In PHP it is just an alias for
the true function count().  It has other meanings logically in other languages
rather than the number of elements in an object.  This should be avoided as it
may confuse developers transitioning to PHP from other languages.

If your array is "huge"

It is reccomended to set a variable first for this case:

THIS->

$max = sizeof($huge_array);
for($i = 0; $i < $max;$i++)
{
code...
}

IS QUICKER THEN->

for($i = 0; $i < sizeof($huge_array);$i++)
{
code...
}
===============================================================================

For people who use this kind of idiom:

for ($i=0; $i<sizeof($array); $i++) {
   ...
}

At least in PHP4, you will notice a large performance improvement if you switch
to:

$max = sizeof($array);
for ($i=0; $i<$max; $i++) {
   ...
}

I had an array with a few thousand items in it, each of them a map with 5
key-value pairs, and just for'ing through the array took a second of CPU on a
decent machine.

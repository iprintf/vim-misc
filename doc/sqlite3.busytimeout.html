===============================================================================

The busyTimeout() method and related API sqlite3_busy_timeout() is a connection
level attribute and affects whole connection and should be set once after
opening connection.  Do not set to zero or you will encounter "Database is
busy" error message when calling query, querySingle, prepare, or execute
methods.  Also ensure that sqlite3 library is compiled with HAVE_USLEEP
defined, otherwise busyTimeout() can only time out in seconds.  It is very
highly recommended to call busyTimeout() with non-zero timeout for reliability
in concurrent environment.
===============================================================================

For SQLite2 (http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlite-busy-timeout.php), PHP
sets the default busy timeout to be 60 seconds when the database is opened.
However, this does not happen for v3 and it has to be done manually.

My personal experience is that the default value of SQLite3, which is 0, is not
enough when you have to do consecutive read/write commits and the file has not
been accessed for long time.

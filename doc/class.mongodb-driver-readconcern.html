预定义常量

MongoDB\Driver\ReadConcern::LOCAL

    Queries using this read concern will return the node's most recent copy of
    the data. This provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
    majority of the nodes (i.e. it may be rolled back).

    This is the default read concern level.

MongoDB\Driver\ReadConcern::MAJORITY

    Queries using this read concern will return the node's most recent copy of
    the data confirmed as having been written to a majority of the nodes (i.e.
    the data cannot be rolled back).

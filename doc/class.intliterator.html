The IntlIterator class

(No version information available, might only be in Git)

简介

This class represents iterator objects throughout the intl extension whenever
the iterator cannot be identified with any other object provided by the
extension. The distinct iterator object used internally by the foreach
construct can only be obtained (in the relevant part here) from objects, so
objects of this class serve the purpose of providing the hook through which
this internal object can be obtained. As a convenience, this class also
implements the Iterator interface, allowing the collection of values to be
navigated using the methods defined in that interface. Both these methods and
the internal iterator objects provided to foreach are backed by the same state
(e.g. the position of the iterator and its current value).

Subclasses may provide richer functionality.

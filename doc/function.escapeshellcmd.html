escapeshellcmd — shell 元字符转义

说明

string escapeshellcmd ( string $command )

escapeshellcmd() 对字符串中可能会欺骗 shell 命令执行任意命令的字符进行转义。此
函数保证用户输入的数据在传送到 exec() 或 system() 函数，或者执行操作符之前进行
转义。

反斜线（\）会在以下字符之前插入： #&;`|*?~<>^()[]{}$\, \x0A 和 \xFF。 ' 和 " 仅
在不配对儿的时候被转义。在 Windows 平台上，所有这些字符以及 % 都会被空格代替。
（译注：实际测试发现在 Windows 平台是前缀 ^ 来转义的。）

参数

command

    要转义的命令。

返回值

转义后的字符串。

范例

Example #1 escapeshellcmd() example

<?php
// 我们故意允许任意数量的参数
$command = './configure '.$_POST['configure_options'];

$escaped_command = escapeshellcmd($command);
 
system($escaped_command);
?>

Warning

escapeshellcmd() 应被用在完整的命令字符串上。即使如此，攻击者还是可以传入任意数
量的参数。请使用 escapeshellarg() 函数对单个参数进行转义。

  • escapeshellarg() - 把字符串转码为可以在 shell 命令里使用的参数
  • exec() - 执行一个外部程序
  • popen() - 打开进程文件指针
  • system() - 执行外部程序，并且显示输出

There is a quirk to be aware of regarding use of echo. If you have a command
which you want to execute which takes input from STDIN, you would normally do:

<?php $output = shell_exec("echo $input | /the/command"); ?>

Unfortunately, this is a *bad idea* and will make your script unportable,
providing a very hard-to-trace bug on some systems. Depending on how the server
is set up, /bin/sh will either call /bin/bash or /bin/dash, and these have very
different versions of echo. Never use echo; use printf instead which is
consistent. How do you escape for printf? Do this:

<?php
$input = 'string to be passed *exactly* to the command';
//Escape only what is needed to get by PHP's parser; we want
//the string data PHP is holding in its buffer to be passed
//exactly to stdin buffer of the command.
$cmd = str_replace(array('\\', '%'), array('\\\\', '%%'), $input);
$cmd = escapeshellarg($cmd);

$output = shell_exec("printf $cmd | /path/to/command");
?>

For the paranoid, this torture test verifies that both shell escaping and
printf's own escaping are handled correctly. Use with confidence!

<?php

$test = 'stuff bash interprets, space: # & ; ` | * ? ~ < > ^ ( ) [ ] { } $ \ \
x0A \xFF. \' " %'.PHP_EOL.
        'stuff bash interprets, no space: #&;`|*?~<>^()[]{}$\\x0A\xFF.\'\"%'.
PHP_EOL.
        'stuff bash interprets, with leading backslash: \# \& \; \` \| \* \? \~
\< \> \^ \( \) \[ \] \{ \} \$ \\\ \\\x0A \\\xFF. \\\' \" \%'.PHP_EOL.
        'printf codes: % \ (used to form %.0#-*+d, or \\ \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \
" \? \062 \0062 \x032 \u0032 and \U00000032)';

echo "These are the strings we are testing with:".PHP_EOL.$test.PHP_EOL;
$cmd = $test;
$cmd = str_replace(array('\\', '%'), array('\\\\', '%%'), $test);
$cmd = escapeshellarg($cmd);

echo PHP_EOL."This is the output using the escaping mechanism given:".PHP_EOL;
echo `printf $cmd | cat`.PHP_EOL;

echo PHP_EOL."They should match exactly".PHP_EOL;
?>

Mind it does not escape ! (exclamation mark). So if you want to i.e. printf()
commands for later use in shell (i.e. by pasting to the console) you need to
escape all exclamation marks or shell will try to process ! as history
reference. This approach shall suffice:

<?php $scaped = str_replace('!', '\!', escapeshellarg( $str ) ); ?>

"normal any user on linux can view almost any directory so:
ls / -als will print a complete list of any file in the linux filesystem
including its size, security and hidden files as well."
ls / -alsR is the whole filesystem.

This function does not work as shown in the php.net examples.

If you put your encoded filename into double-quotes as they suggest, then it
will break on certain characters in filenames, such as ampersand.

For example if you have a filename called "foo & bar.jpg" and you use this
function on it, your resulting filename when double-quoted will produce this
and not be found:

"foo \& bar.jpg"

If you need to have a single argument where spaces are included then do not use
this function with added double-quotes, use escapeshellarg() which encloses the
whole string in single quotes.

I do not understand which purpose this particular function is intended for.  I
can't see any use for it, unless you pass it through another function and
convert spaces " " to "\ ", which would allow you to use the string directly on
the command line.

Well guys, i find it very hard that escapeshellarg and escapeshellcmd are
forcely run when passing a command to exec, system or popen, when safe_mode is
turned on.

Right now, i did not find any working solution to pass commands like this:
cmd -arg1 -arg2 "<BLA varname=\"varvalue\" varname1=\"varvalue1\" />"

it is just the case, that the parameter for arg2 which is a string that looks
like an HTML-Tag with various attributes set, all attributes of the string in
arg2 gets splitted by the whitespaces within. this wont happen with safe_mode
turned off, so it must be one of the escapefunctions, that breaks
functionality.

In order to circumvent this, i have made a temporary solution, which
dynamically creates a skriptfile (by fopen), which just contains the whole
command with arguments, and then execute that skriptfile. i dont like that
solution, but in the other hand, safe_mode cannot be easily turned off on that
server.

escaping strings for a shell is tricky.

  If your target system is windows give up now.  windows isn't even self
consisitent in how to escape stuff.

  if unix convert everything to octal - although this is hardest to implement
it's the easiest to implement correctly - there are no special cases..

This function is great -- except when you need to legitimately use an escaped
character as part of your command.  The code below leaves the parts of the
command that are enclosed within single quotes alone, but escapes the rest eg:

"echo Never use the '<blink>' tag ; cat /etc/passwd"
becomes:
"echo Never use the '<blink>' tag \; cat /etc/passwd"
and not:
"echo Never use the '\<blink\>' tag \; cat /etc/passwd"

i.e, we really want the ';' escaped, but not the HTML tag.  I really needed the
code below in order to run the external ImageMagick's 'convert' command
properly and safely...

<?php

// Escape whole string
$cmdQ = escapeshellcmd($cmd);

// Build array of quoted parts, and the same escaped
preg_match_all('/\'[^\']+\'/', $cmd, $matches);
$matches = current($matches);
$quoted = array();
foreach( $matches as $match )
    $quoted[escapeshellcmd($match)] = $match;

// Replace sections that were single quoted with original content
foreach( $quoted as $search => $replace )
    $cmdQ = str_replace( $search, $replace, $cmdQ );

return $cmdQ;

?>

I've got a php script that needs to pass a username and password via exec to a
perl script.  The problem is valid password characters were getting escaped...

Here's a little perl function I wrote to fix it.

sub unescape_string {
      my $string = shift;
      # all these interpolated regex's are slow, so if there's no
      # backslash in the string don't bother with it
      # index() is faster then a regex
      if ( ! index($string,'\\\\') ) {
         return $string;
      }
      my @characters = ('#', '&', ';', '`', '|', '*', '?', '~', '<', '>', '^',
'(', ')',
                        '[', ']', '{', '}', '$', '\\', ',', ' ', '\x0A', '\xFF'
);
      my $character;
      foreach $character (@characters) {
         $character = quotemeta($character);
         my $pattern = "\\\\(" . $character . ")";
         $string =~ s/$pattern/$1/g;
      }
      return $string;
}

Hope this is useful.

the main reason for quoting a command is that it not multiple  command can be
joined. i don't know for sure if this is the right syntax but remeber that this
can do some nice security breaks. here's one way of how to know exactly what
your trying to break into for.

normal any user on linux can view almost any directory so:
ls / -als will print a complete list of any file in the linux filesystem
including its size, security and hidden files as well.

now the output would only become known to php and never will the user be able
to view this data unless the php script would actual start to print it out.
like passtru does!! but a good php coder knows never to use passtru unless not
otherwise possible.

but what would happen if you can direct the output from ls also from that same
commandline to a file in the webroot most webserver still default their
base-webroot to /var/www/ so storing it there in text file to download it later
and you can simply take coffee while checking wich files can be read by php
security mode and then simply use the cp command to copy those to the webroot
and download them to your own hard-disk. without a list of the files you can
only guess where to copy from! and thats harder then guessing the root
password.

so if the first command was quoted it is not possible to attach another command
because of a syntax error. think of all the thinks you can do once you got a
complete list of every file on the filesystem. including mounted once via NFS
and others. security starts at keeping the door hidden.

also another nice command for hanging the webserver can be "php <?php while(
true){ exec('ls / -als'); }; ?>" this keeps creating a file list on the entire
filesystem wich not only keeps the hard-disk(s) bussy but also memory and cpu  
wich must store the returned list. so keeping in mind not all command accepted
from users can be used blind.

actualy never accept any command from external sources only proven built-in
predefined commands should be executed.

To extract an archive file to a specific folder using exec() :

<?php
$result = exec(escapeshellcmd("tar -xvvf /path/to/archive.tar -C /path/to/
extract/to/"));
?>

escapeshellcmd() is used here because I am getting the file path via user input
/ upload.

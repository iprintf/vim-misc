The $referral that is used in the callback function isn't the bind dn, but the
dn of the record that was being accessed (or rather it's location on the master
server, I guess, if there is a difference in the two), so you need to rebind
with your existing credentials. The connection ($ldap) appears to have already
been made to the new server, so it is just a rebind process, nothing else more
complicated than that. There must be a loop in the underlying library that
re-submits the request that prompted the referral until either a success or
fail is returned.

I guess if the bind dn you were using in the first place won't let you edit the
record on the master, then that is an ldap rather than php issue. However, at
least with the rebind procedure you have a way to modify the bind dn first.

So, the rebind process is really quite simple, now that I understand how it
works! I was assuming it to be way more complicated. In it's simplest form,
this is all you need, assuming your bind $dn and $pass are globals

<?php
function rebind($ldap, $referral) {
    // Set ldap options
    ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
    ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, True);
    ldap_set_rebind_proc($ldap, 'rebind');
    // Rebind
    if (!ldap_bind($ldap, $dn, $pass)) {
            echo 'Could not bind to referral server';
            return 1; // Yes, a 1 means a failure.
        }
    return 0; // Yes, return a 0 on success.
    }
?>
===============================================================================

I finally have referrals working using the ldap_set_rebind_proc function. Don't
connect to the referral server in your callback function. This is done for you.
You only have to bind. The callback must return 0 if the bind succeeds or 1 if
it fails.

Consider a master - slave LDAP setup where the slave is read-only and refers
writes to the master. For the PHP on the slave, you need something like this:

<?php

// Callback function
function rebind($ldap, $referral) {
    // ldap options
    ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
    ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, True);
    ldap_set_rebind_proc($ldap, 'rebind');
    // The referral is of the form:
    //  ldaps://newhost/cn=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
    $refparts = explode('/', $referral);
    if (count($refparts) > 2) {
        // Get the bind dn from referral
        $dn = $refparts[3];
        // Bind to new host
        if (!ldap_bind($ldap, $dn, $pass)) {
            echo 'Could not bind to referral server';
            return 1;
        }
    } else {
        // Try anonymous bind
        if (!ldap_bind($ldap)) {
            echo 'Could not bind to referral server anonymously';
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
   
// Initial ldap connection to slave server
$ldap_host = 'localhost'
$ds = ldap_connect($ldap_host);
// ldap options
ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)
ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, True)
// Set callback function
ldap_set_rebind_proc($ds, 'rebind'))
// bind
ldap_bind($ds, $dn, $pass)
// ldap write
ldap_modify($ds, $dn, $attr);

?>

Accessing passwords and other data from your callback is easier if you use a
class method as the callback function. The callback would be initialized like
this:

<?php

ldap_set_rebind_proc($ldap, 'MyClass::rebind');

?>

I have now spent enough time looking at this issue to say that ldap referrals,
at least when trying to add, modify or delete a record on a slave server that
correctly gives a referral to a master server, does not work in php. My
suggestion is turn turn off ldap referrals and write your own add, modify and
delete functions with built in referral handling. Something like this:

<?php
function ldap_referral_add($connection,$add_dn,$Add_entry,$bind_dn,$bind_pw)
    {
    $rconnection = $connection;
    $loop = 10; # max number of referral hops.
    # Turn off normal referrals
    ldap_get_option($connection,LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS,$old_referral_setting)
    do
        {
        $response = ldap_add($rconnection,$dn,$entry);
        # We get a success message:
        if ( $response )
            {
            ldap_unbind($rconnection);
            $loop = 0;    # Probably not needed
            ldap_set_option($connection,LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS,
$old_referral_setting);
            return true;
            }
        # We get a referral message:
        elseif ( !$response && ldap_errno($rconnection) == 0x0a )
            {
            $new_server_url = $server= preg_replace('!^(ldap://[^/]+)/.*$!', '\
\1', $ldap_error($rconnection)); # May need some sanity checking here
            $rconnection = ldap_connect($new_server_url);
            ldap_set_option($rconnection,LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS,0)
            ldap_set_option($rconnection,LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)
            ldap_bind($rconnection,$bind_dn,$bind_pw);
            $loop = $loop - 1;
            }
        else
            {
            ldap_unbind($rconnection);
            $loop = 0;    # Probably not needed
            ldap_set_option($connection,LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS,
$old_referral_setting);
            return false;
            }
        } while ( $loop > 0);
    }
?>

I have had quite a hard time finding good information about chasing referrals
so I am adding my tuppence worth here. I still haven't got my test code working
fully so please look further down the page for updates.

The way this appears to have to work is that you use this function to set a
callback function of your own to connect and bind to the referral server. you
need to set this along with forcing v3 ldap and setting the referral chasing to
on as part of setting up the initial connection, so just after the connect but
before the bind, you need something like:

<?php
        $ds = ldap_connect($server);
        ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
        ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 1);
        ldap_set_rebind_proc($ds, "rebind");
        ldap_bind($ds,$dn,$pass);
?>

This callback function (called rebind in the above example needs two arguments.
These arguments are preset and are supplied when the callback function is
called. The first is the ldap link identifier. I assume this is supplied as the
function could be used successively by a number of consecutive referrals. The
second is the ldap referral URL supplied by the initial server. I have seen
notes that say this function must be defined prior to being set by
ldap_set_rebind_proc, but as yet I cannot confirm this.

My setup is based on a master - slave ldap server configuration, with the PHP
application residing on the slave where it does localhost lookups. When your
try to write to the slave ldap server, the server returns a referral URL, and
the internal PHP function then calls the callback function.

Despite the code already on this page, which appears to also be used to test
the PHP code, I believe it is wrong. I think it simply reconnects to the
initial server. I believe that what the callback function should do is to
connect to the new server, and bind to it. My test code currently looks like
this:

<?php
function rebind($ldap, $referral) {
        global $dn;
        global $pass;
        $server= preg_replace('!^(ldap://[^/]+)/.*$!', '\\1', $referral);
        if (!($ldap = ldap_connect($server))){
                echo "reconnect failed - <br>";
                return 1;
        }
        ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
        ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 1);
        ldap_set_rebind_proc($ldap, "rebind");
        if (!ldap_bind($ldap,$dn,$pass)){
                echo "rebind failed - <br>";
                return 1;
        }
        return 0;
}
?>

As far as I can tell, a return value of 0 means success and any other value
means it has failed. The complete lack of documentation doesn't help.

The above code works all the way to authenticating against the new server, but
at the moment I appear to be getting an unbind request before it tries to write
the record to the new server, so it fails.

I would also recommend adding a ldap_start_tls before the bind as well.
===============================================================================

PHP expects the ldap function ldap_set_rebind_proc to be the one that has tree
parameters.  As far as I can tell this isn't in the 2.0 release of OpenLDAP. 
But made it into 2.1.  Configure will tell you

checking for 3 arg ldap_set_rebind_proc... no
===============================================================================

Couse there was no example code for this function, i had alot of troubles to
make it work properly.

So, here is working example:

function rebind_on_ref ($ds, $ldap_url) {
  global $binddn;    // DN used to bind
  global $bindpw;    // password used to bind

  // required by most modern LDAP servers, use LDAPv3
  ldap_set_option($a, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);

  if (!ldap_bind($a,$binddn,$bindpw)) {
        print "Cannot bind";
  }
}
===============================================================================

If rebind_proc isn't compiled in slapd, your will never get that funtction
working. Check out the new alpha release of slapd and rtfm.

The Event class

(PECL event >= 1.2.6-beta)

简介

Event class represents and event firing on a file descriptor being ready to
read from or write to; a file descriptor becoming ready to read from or write
to(edge-triggered I/O only); a timeout expiring; a signal occuring; a
user-triggered event.

Every event is associated with EventBase . However, event will never fire until
it is added (via Event::add() ). An added event remains in pending state until
the registered event occurs, thus turning it to active state. To handle events
user may register a callback which is called when event becomes active. If
event is configured persistent , it remains pending. If it is not persistent,
it stops being pending when it's callback runs. Event::del() method deletes
event, thus making it non-pending. By means of Event::add() method it could be
added again.

属性

pending

    Whether event is pending. See About event persistence .

预定义常量

Event::ET

    Indicates that the event should be edge-triggered, if the underlying event
    base backend supports edge-triggered events. This affects the semantics of
    Event::READ and Event::WRITE .

Event::PERSIST

    Indicates that the event is persistent. See About event persistence .

Event::READ

    This flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided file
    descriptor(usually a stream resource, or socket) is ready for reading.

Event::WRITE

    This flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided file
    descriptor(usually a stream resource, or socket) is ready for reading.

Event::SIGNAL

    Used to implement signal detection. See "Constructing signal events" below.

Event::TIMEOUT

    This flag indicates an event that becomes active after a timeout elapses.

    The Event::TIMEOUT flag is ignored when constructing an event: one can
    either set a timeout when event is added , or not. It is set in the $what
    argument to the callback function when a timeout has occurred.

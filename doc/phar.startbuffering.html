Phar::startBuffering

(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 1.0.0)

Phar::startBuffering — Start buffering Phar write operations, do not modify the
Phar object on disk

说明

public void Phar::startBuffering ( void )

Although technically unnecessary, the Phar::startBuffering() method can provide
a significant performance boost when creating or modifying a Phar archive with
a large number of files. Ordinarily, every time a file within a Phar archive is
created or modified in any way, the entire Phar archive will be recreated with
the changes. In this way, the archive will be up-to-date with the activity
performed on it.

However, this can be unnecessary when simply creating a new Phar archive, when
it would make more sense to write the entire archive out at once. Similarly, it
is often necessary to make a series of changes and to ensure that they all are
possible before making any changes on disk, similar to the relational database
concept of transactions. the Phar::startBuffering()/Phar::stopBuffering() pair
of methods is provided for this purpose.

Phar write buffering is per-archive, buffering active for the foo.phar Phar
archive does not affect changes to the bar.phar Phar archive.

范例

Example #1 A Phar::startBuffering() example

<?php
// make sure it doesn't exist
@unlink('brandnewphar.phar');
try {
    $p = new Phar(dirname(__FILE__) . '/brandnewphar.phar', 0, 
'brandnewphar.phar');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Could not create phar:', $e;
}
echo 'The new phar has ' . $p->count() . " entries\n";
$p->startBuffering();
$p['file.txt'] = 'hi';
$p['file2.txt'] = 'there';
$p['file2.txt']->setCompressedGZ();
$p['file3.txt'] = 'babyface';
$p['file3.txt']->setMetadata(42);
$p->setStub("<?php
function __autoload($class)
{
    include 'phar://myphar.phar/' . str_replace('_', '/', $class) . '.php';
}
Phar::mapPhar('myphar.phar');
include 'phar://myphar.phar/startup.php';
__HALT_COMPILER();");
$p->stopBuffering();
?>

    being buffered, or are flushing directly to disk

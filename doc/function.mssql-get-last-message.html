mssql_get_last_message

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PECL odbtp >= 1.1.1)

mssql_get_last_message — Returns the last message from the server

Warning

This function was REMOVED in PHP 7.0.0.

Alternatives to this function include:

  • PDOStatement::errorInfo()
  • sqlsrv_errors()
  • odbc_errormsg()

说明

string mssql_get_last_message ( void )

Gets the last message from the MS-SQL server

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

Returns last error message from server, or an empty string if no error messages
are returned from MSSQL.

范例

Example #1 mssql_get_last_message() example

<?php
// Connect to MSSQL and select the database
mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');
mssql_select_db('php');

// Make a query that will fail
$query = @mssql_query('SELECT * FROM [php].[dbo].[not-found]');

if (!$query) {
    // The query has failed, print a nice error message
    // using mssql_get_last_message()
    die('MSSQL error: ' . mssql_get_last_message());
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

MSSQL error: Invalid object name 'php.dbo.not-found'.

I've noticed that there's a few people putting really elongated code out there
for a MSSQL Connection / Error function.

Firstly, i think that rewriting pre-existing functions is a waste of parsing
time, so if you're going to try and return an error, usee
mssql_get_last_message() as you would with mysql_error().

Here is an adapted version of a MySQL Connection function;

    function mssql_autoconnect() {
        $cString = parse_url($config['connect_url']);
        $cLink = mssql_connect($cString['host'], $cString['user'], $cString
['pass']) or die(mssql_get_last_message());
        mssql_select_db(preg_replace("///",$cString['path']),$cLink);
        return $cLink;
    }
===============================================================================

Here I am again :). My last function stinks :p (well, actually, MSSQL doesn't
always does the same thing with different errors :/. That last function can't
cope with that. The following function can cope with that. The only weird thing
I had with it was that when I entered a table, which don't exists, in my SELECT
query, the first mssql_get_last_message() doesn't always gets the correct
message. It sometimes gets the message from the last action. I have no
explination for it. Anyway: this is the beter version of my last function.  The
usage is explained in my last post:

<?php
function query($sQuery, $hDb_conn, $sError, $bDebug)
{
    if(!$rQuery = @mssql_query($sQuery, $hDb_conn))
    {
        $sMssql_get_last_message = mssql_get_last_message();
        $sQuery_added  = "BEGIN TRY\n";
        $sQuery_added .= "\t".$sQuery."\n";
        $sQuery_added .= "END TRY\n";
        $sQuery_added .= "BEGIN CATCH\n";
        $sQuery_added .= "\tSELECT 'Error: '  + ERROR_MESSAGE()\n";
        $sQuery_added .= "END CATCH";
        $rRun2= @mssql_query($sQuery_added, $hDb_conn);
        $aReturn = @mssql_fetch_assoc($rRun2);
        if(empty($aReturn))
        {
            echo $sError.'. MSSQL returned: '.$sMssql_get_last_message.'.<br>
Executed query: '.nl2br($sQuery);
        }
        elseif(isset($aReturn['computed']))
        {
            echo $sError.'. MSSQL returned: '.$aReturn['computed'].'.<br>
Executed query: '.nl2br($sQuery);
        }
        return FALSE;
    }
    else
    {
        return $rQuery;
    }
}
?>

Disclaimer: This is not the original function that I use in my project. The
original function has Dutch text and uses some other functions that I have. I
have removed my own functions and translated everything to English. That is
everything I did. I only used a second function for the error messages. So I
think everything should work, but I don't know for sure.
===============================================================================

MS SQL doesn't set errors as mysql does. $php_error is set as a string that
doesn't help at all. The error comes in form of a Warning, which isn't pretty.
So what you can do is capture the output of the warning and create your own
error message, something like this:

function treat_mssql_error($buffer) {
    $buffer=ereg_replace("<br>\n<b>Warning</b>:  MS SQL message:","<b>Error in
query (SQL Server)</b>: ",$buffer);
    $buffer=explode("(severity",$buffer);
    return $buffer[0]."</font>";
}

function my_query($query,$cnx) {
    global $sql_error;
    ob_start();
    $result=mssql_query($query,$cnx);
    if(!$result)
    {
        $sql_error=treat_mssql_error(ob_get_contents());
        ob_end_clean();
        return false;
    }
    ob_end_clean();
    return true;
}

you can set treat_mssql_error() to fit your needs, and there u go. A personal
error handler.
===============================================================================

If you want to view the last ID inserted, mssql_get_last_message() will not
return this.
MySQL have a function mysql_insert_id() that returns it. MSSQl don't.
To resolve this, you must run this query:

$query="SELECT @@IDENTITY as last_insert_id"
mssql_query($query, $connection);

and it will return the last ID inserted in the database.
===============================================================================

As Klaus pointed out earlier, the command MSSQL_GET_LAST_MESSAGE() only returns
the last line of an error message and that may not be enough for debugging.

I had a failing MSSQL_QUERY returning "the statement has been terminated" via
MSSQL_GET_LAST_MESSAGE() so I tried Klaus' technique to get more information.

Unfortunately, the connection to the database was also being broken, keeping
Klaus' technique from looking up the error number.

The solution to my case was to increase the PHP timeout for MSSQL queries from
the default 60 seconds to 300 by adding this to PHP.INI:

mssql.timeout = 300
===============================================================================

If you work with stored procedures and want to have a neat error-handling, try
this:
procedure:
CREATE PROCEDURE TEST_ERROR  AS
RAISERROR('myMessage:test', 2, 1) WITH SETERROR

2 is error-severity, which should be below 11 to prevent php to output error
directly.
you get this message with mssql_get_last_message()
after executing the stored procedure.
To prevent your code from reacting on all messages you can define a string
(e.g. 'myMessage:') and parse for it:
<?php
$db = mssql_connect(DBHost, DBLogin, DBPassword);
mssql_select_db(DBName, $db);
$query = "exec TEST_ERROR";
$rs = mssql_query($query, $db);
$lastMsg = mssql_get_last_message();
if strstr($lastMsg, 'myMessage:') echo $lastMsg;
?>
===============================================================================

With ref to last_insert_id;

you can also do "SELECT ident_current('table_name')" with msSQL, which is the
same thing.
Don't forget that this counts as a seperate SQL query, so you will have to
fetch the results as well, which isn't as neat as MySQL_insert_id().
===============================================================================

To get a numeric error code from mssql you can do a select that looks something
like "select @@ERROR as ErrorCode".

@@ERROR is a global variable that always contains the error code for the last
SQL statement run on the current connection.  If there is no error, code will
equal 0.

@@IDENTITY is another useful one to know.  It is the value of the last identity
created (similar to MySQL's auto_increment field) and with this you can create
a function that works like MySQL's mysql_insert_id() function.
===============================================================================

another exsample

mssql_query("INSERT INTO catalog (id, temp) VALUES (1, 'temp')") or exit
(mssql_get_last_message());
===============================================================================

I've found mssql_get_last_message to be useful for fetching errors in the event
MSSQL queries fail.

<?php

$q = @mssql_query("asdfasdfasfdasfd");
if (!$q)
     print "MSSQL Query failed: " . mssql_get_last_message() . "<br />\n";

?>

Example #1 IntlCalendar::fieldDifference()

<?php
ini_set('date.timezone', 'Europe/Lisbon');
ini_set('intl.default_locale', 'fr_FR');

$cal1 = IntlCalendar::fromDateTime('2012-02-29 09:00:11');
$cal2 = IntlCalendar::fromDateTime('2013-03-01 09:19:29');
$time = $cal2->getTime();

echo "Time before: ", IntlDateFormatter::formatObject($cal1), "\n";

printf(
    "The difference in time is %d year(s), %d month(s), "
  . "%d day(s), %d hour(s) and %d minute(s)\n",
    $cal1->fieldDifference($time, IntlCalendar::FIELD_YEAR),
    $cal1->fieldDifference($time, IntlCalendar::FIELD_MONTH),
    $cal1->fieldDifference($time, IntlCalendar::FIELD_DAY_OF_MONTH),
    $cal1->fieldDifference($time, IntlCalendar::FIELD_HOUR_OF_DAY),
    $cal1->fieldDifference($time, IntlCalendar::FIELD_MINUTE)
);

//now it was advanced to the target time, exception for the seconds,
//for which we did not measure the difference
echo "Time after: ", IntlDateFormatter::formatObject($cal1), "\n";

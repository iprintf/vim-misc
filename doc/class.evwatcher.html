The EvWatcher class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

EvWatcher is a base class for all watchers( EvCheck , EvChild etc.). Since
EvWatcher 's constructor is abstract , one can't(and don't need to) create
EvWatcher objects directly.

类摘要

属性

is_active

    Readonly . TRUE if the watcher is active. FALSE otherwise.

data

    User custom data associated with the watcher

is_pending

    Readonly .TRUE if the watcher is pending, i.e. it has outstanding events,
    but its callback has not yet been invoked. FALSE otherwise. As long, as a
    watcher is pending(but not active), one must not change its priority.

priority

    Integer between Ev::MINPRI and Ev::MAXPRI . Pending watchers with higher
    priority will be invoked before watchers with lower priority, but priority
    will not keep watchers from being executed(except for EvIdle watchers).
    EvIdle watchers provide functionality to suppress invocation when higher
    priority events are pending.

When deleting user account(s) from IMAP server don't forget to put full server
name and port. Also need to be logged as IMAP admin and set ACL.
This worked for Cyrus:

<?php
//Credentials
$cyrusadmin_username="cyrus";
$cyrusadmin_password="cyruspassword";
$cyrus_serverip="fellowship.ring.net";

//User to delete
$username="frodoBaggins";

//Open the connection to IMAP server (Cyrus)
   $mbox=imap_open("{".$serverip.":143}",$cyrusadmin_username, 
$cyrusadmin_password, OP_HALFOPEN)
            or die('IMAP Could not connect because '.imap_last_error());
//Set ACL - Give rights to $cyrusadmin_username to delete mailbox
   imap_setacl ($mbox, "user.".$username, $cyrusadmin_username, "lrswipcda")
            or die('Could not setacl on mailbox');
//Delete mailbox
   imap_deletemailbox($mbox,"{".$serverip.":143}user.".$username)
            or die('Could not delete mailbox');
?>
===============================================================================

Recent versions of the Cyrus imapd define mailbox ACLs as follows:

c (create)
The user may create new sub-mailboxes of the mailbox, or delete or rename the
current mailbox.

d (delete)
The user may store the "Deleted" flag, and perform expunges.

This means to delete a mailbox, you will need to give the user you are
connecting with via imap_open() "c" rights on the mailbox in order for
imap_deletemailbox() to work.  Setting "d" rights for yourself is not the same.

Check the documentation for your version of Cyrus imapd.

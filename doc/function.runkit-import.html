(PECL runkit >= 0.7.0)

runkit_import — Process a PHP file importing function and class definitions,
overwriting where appropriate

说明

bool runkit_import ( string $filename [, int $flags =
RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_METHODS ] )

Similar to include however any code residing outside of a function or class is
simply ignored. Additionally, depending on the value of flags, any functions or
classes which already exist in the currently running environment may be
automatically overwritten by their new definitions.

参数

filename

    Filename to import function and class definitions from

flags

    Bitwise OR of the RUNKIT_IMPORT_* family of constants.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 runkit_import() example

<?php
// import classes entirely
runkit_import('myfile.inc', RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASSES);

/* import classes, but not imports their static properties
   (RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_STATIC_PROPS is available since 1.0.1) */
runkit_import('myfile.inc', RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASSES & ~
RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_STATIC_PROPS);

/* import only static properties of classes
   (RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_STATIC_PROPS is available since 1.0.1) */
runkit_import('myfile.inc', RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_STATIC_PROPS);
?>

===============================================================================

Heres a nice function to reload the whole program, note, requires PHP5.1:

<?php
function reload() {
  $files = get_included_files();
  foreach($files as $file) {
    if (runkit_lint_file($file)) {
      runkit_import($file);
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

It appears that this function still doesn't remove the previous class. I'm not
sure what it does to it, but looking at memory usage, it only goes up instead
of staying the same or going down (This was when I reloaded a class that was
exactly the same).

So that might be something to fix, unless I'm doing something wrong.

In reply to the comment made by info at lucasvd dot nl:

Runkit WILL reload classes, but the runkit_import must be called from inside an
other class or object to do so.

<?php
class reload{
    function __construct($file){
        runkit_import($file);
    }
}

new reload("myclassfile.php");
?>
===============================================================================

Note that reloading classes does not work, when you're using this extension on
the PHP Command Line Interface.
===============================================================================

When using this function to override an existing class, you need to be careful
in cases where the new definition 'extends' another class - it won't work.

For example,

<?php
// File 1

class BaseCls { }

class TestCls extends BaseCls {
  function hi () { echo "Hi"; }
}

runkit_import('test2.php');

?>

<?php
// File 2
class TestCls extends BaseCls {
  function hi () { echo "Hi again!"; }
}
?>

will NOT work. In file two, you need to omit the 'extends BaseCls'. Note
however, that anything from BaseCls will still be in TestCls since it was
defined originally in file 1.

From what I can tell, runkit_import defines and overwrites elements - however
it does not delete.
===============================================================================

I was experiencing problems using this function on a script. I discovered
through trial and error that you CANNOT reload a function (or method of a
class) if it has been called (e.g, its present in the debug_backtrace). Also
you cannot redeclare a function that is used by set_error_handler.

The reasons are logical, but it took me a good 2 days of debugging to find it,
hope this saves someone a headache.

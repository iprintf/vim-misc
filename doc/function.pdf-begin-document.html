If you want a complete documentation on the entire PDFlib is it possible to
download, read and study the reference .pdf file (and related) on [ http://
www.pdflib.com/fileadmin/pdflib/pdf/manuals/PDFlib-7-API-reference.pdf ]

Note that this link points to a precise version of the library. You may want to
check newer versions in the future on the same domain.

There doesn't seem to be much documentation on setting options with this
function, but here's the format for setting some basic things:

$optlist = "destination={page=1 type=fixed zoom=1 top=100 left=50}";
PDF_begin_document($pdfdoc, $filename, $optlist );

the '=' character can be replaced with a space, but I think '=' makes the code
more readable.
Also, you must include 'type=fixed' to use 'zoom','left', or 'top'. You can set
'page' without it, though.
Hope this helps. And if anybody knows a good reference for the options that can
be set here and what the format is, please link.

Creating a PDF with a defined PDF-Version (1.6 in this case) works like this:

if (PDF_begin_document($p,  "", "compatibility 1.6") == 0) {
    die("Error: " . PDF_get_errmsg($p));
}

The EventBase class

(PECL event >= 1.2.6-beta)

简介

EventBase class represents libevent's event base structure. It holds a set of
events and can poll to determine which events are active.

Each event base has a method , or a backend that it uses to determine which
events are ready. The recognized methods are: select , poll , epoll , kqueue ,
devpoll , evport and win32 .

To configure event base to use, or avoid specific backend EventConfig class can
be used.

Warning

Do NOT destroy the EventBase object as long as resources of the associated
Event objects are not released. Otherwise, it will lead to unpredictable
results!

预定义常量

EventBase::LOOP_ONCE

    Flag used with EventBase::loop() method which means: "block until libevent
    has an active event, then exit once all active events have had their
    callbacks run".

EventBase::LOOP_NONBLOCK

    Flag used with EventBase::loop() method which means: "do not block: see
    which events are ready now, run the callbacks of the highest-priority ones,
    then exit".

EventBase::NOLOCK

    Configuration flag. Do not allocate a lock for the event base, even if we
    have locking set up".

EventBase::STARTUP_IOCP

    Windows-only configuration flag. Enables the IOCP dispatcher at startup.

EventBase::NO_CACHE_TIME

    Configuration flag. Instead of checking the current time every time the
    event loop is ready to run timeout callbacks, check after each timeout
    callback.

EventBase::EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST

    If we are using the epoll backend, this flag says that it is safe to use
    Libevent's internal change-list code to batch up adds and deletes in order
    to try to do as few syscalls as possible.

    Setting this flag can make code run faster, but it may trigger a Linux bug:
    it is not safe to use this flag if one has any fds cloned by dup(), or its
    variants. Doing so will produce strange and hard-to-diagnose bugs.

    This flag can also be activated by settnig the EVENT_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST
    environment variable.

    This flag has no effect if one winds up using a backend other than epoll .

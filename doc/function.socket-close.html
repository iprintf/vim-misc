说明

void socket_close ( resource $socket )

socket_close() 会关闭掉给定的 socket 资源。这个函数只针对套接字资源有效，不能用
在其他类型的资源类型上。

参数

socket

    由 socket_create() 或者是 socket_accept() 创建的有效的套接字资源。

返回值

没有返回值。

  • socket_bind() - 给套接字绑定名字
  • socket_listen() - Listens for a connection on a socket
  • socket_create() - 创建一个套接字（通讯节点）
  • socket_strerror() - Return a string describing a socket error

PHP: 5.1.4
Summary: close() does not relinquish socket immediately.

With the BSD socket implementation (which is the socket interface used by PHP),
a socket_close() may close the socket, but there may yet be data to send. Until
the data is sent, the port will not be available. Therefore, all further
bindings attempted on that port will not be acceptable due to the 'port can not
be reused' (the approximate message, anyway) error. Ordinarily, if the REUSABLE
socket option is set, the only thing that will raise such an error is a binding
to a specific IP/PORT combination that is already bound.

To avoid this problem, you must tell it to delay returning until the port
either sends the rest of its data, or times-out in doing it. This is done via
the SO_LINGER option. To set this option, it requires an array of two elements:
the first indicates whether a linger is required on any data before the
shutdown completes, and the second indicates whether we actually linger. If we
set a nonzero to the first while setting a zero to the second, we would simply
drop whatever data is waiting in the buffer, and close the socket. To tell it
simply to wait on the data to be sent, you send a non-zero for both: array(1,
1).

Note that if you have indicated not to block (socket_set_nonblock()), it will
simply exit no matter what, much like it usually would. In this case it bursts
an EWOULDWAIT flag, but since I don't think we have access to these socket
flags in PHP, one should re-enable blocking right before they set the linger
and quit.

    // These commands get fed straight through to the Unix socket libraries..
That's why they're a little more C-like.
    $arrOpt = array('l_onoff' => 1, 'l_linger' => 1);
    socket_set_block($this->Socket);
    socket_set_option($this->Socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, $arrOpt);
    socket_close($this->Socket);

Sometimes it seems that you have to shutdown() a socket before you can close()
it. I experienced that while making a chatserver in PHP with this cool socket
extension.

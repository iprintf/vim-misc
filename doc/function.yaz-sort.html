yaz_sort — Sets sorting criteria

说明

void yaz_sort ( resource $id , string $criteria )

This function sets sorting criteria and enables Z39.50 Sort.

Call this function before yaz_search(). Using this function alone does not have
any effect. When used in conjunction with yaz_search(), a Z39.50 Sort will be
sent after a search response has been received and before any records are
retrieved with Z39.50 Present (yaz_present().

参数

id

    The connection resource returned by yaz_connect().

criteria

    A string that takes the form field1 flags1 field2 flags2 where field1
    specifies the primary attributes for sort, field2 seconds, etc..

    The field specifies either a numerical attribute combinations consisting of
    type=value pairs separated by comma (e.g. 1=4,2=1) ; or the field may
    specify a plain string criteria (e.g. title. The flags is a sequence of the
    following characters which may not be separated by any white space.

    Sort Flags
    a

        Sort ascending

    d

        Sort descending

    i

        Case insensitive sorting

    s

        Case sensitive sorting

返回值

范例

Example #1 Sort Criterias

To sort on Bib1 attribute title, case insensitive, and ascending you would use
the following sort criteria:

1=4 ia

If the secondary sorting criteria should be author, case sensitive and
ascending you would use:

1=4 ia 1=1003 sa


User Contributed Notes 1 note

===============================================================================

This information is located in several places in the documentation, but takes
awhile to find. 

yaz_sort() only works for fields that have an associated sort register. 
Failure to link a sort register will generate the error "Cannot sort according
to sequence".

The sort register is created in the default.idx file and referenced in the
*.abs file.  This is the sort register setting in default.idx:

...
# Sort register (no mapping at all)
sort s
completeness 1
charmap string.chr
...

In the above code the "s" register is setup as the sort register.  Charmap
string.chr defines the string conversion for diacritics.

This is the reference to the sort index in the *abs file:

...
elm (2,1)                   title                      !:w,!:p,!:s
...

In the above line the "!:s" causes a sort register to be created for the field.

Once the above changes have been made, reindex all the source records and
restart the server.   Check for a "sort<fieldid>-0.mf" file in the zebra data
directory to verify operation.  yaz_sort() should now work properly.

Unlink refers to the underlying UNIX command, unlink, which removes the
symbolic or hard link to the file, not necessarily the file itself. The file is
only removed when all links to the file are removed.

A "dummy entry" is a "fake" entry or, in this case, an entry for a command that
does not actually exist, so that people can find the correct one. The word
"dummy" is used in the same way as in the expression "a tailor's dummy", which
is a fake person used to stand in for a real client so that they can see the
results of the work.

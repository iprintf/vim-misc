EventBuffer::pullup — Linearizes data within buffer and returns it's contents
as a string

说明

public string EventBuffer::pullup ( int $size )

"Linearizes" the first size bytes of the buffer, copying or moving them as
needed to ensure that they are all contiguous and occupying the same chunk of
memory. If size is negative, the function linearizes the entire buffer.

Warning

Calling EventBuffer::pullup() with a large size can be quite slow, since it
potentially needs to copy the entire buffer's contents.

参数

size

    The number of bytes required to be contiguous within the buffer.

返回值

If size is greater than the number of bytes in the buffer, the function returns
NULL. Otherwise, EventBuffer::pullup() returns string.

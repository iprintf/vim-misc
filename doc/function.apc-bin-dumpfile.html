===============================================================================

To prevent losing all of your APC custom user data on an apache restart, use
this function along with apc_bin_loadfile to save your APC Memory Data on a
restart of apache.

e.g.  Write a php script to dump the file and one to re-load the file.   Call
the dump script directly before stopping apache, and then call the reload
script directly after starting apache.

<?php
//saveapc
      apc_bin_dumpfile(array(),null,"/path/to/my/file.data");
?>

<?php
//loadapc
     apc_bin_loadfile("/path/to/my/file.data");
?>

#  wget http://www.example.com/saveapc.php
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
#  wget http://www.example.com/loadapc.php

Particularly useful if you have a custom session handler using APC for storage

Even more handy, update the httpd restart bash script to automatically make
these calls for you on a restart

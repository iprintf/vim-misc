px_open_fp — Open paradox database

说明

bool px_open_fp ( resource $pxdoc , resource $file )

Open an existing paradox database file. The actual file has to be opened before
with fopen(). This function can also be used to open primary index files and
tread them like a paradox database. This is supported for those who would like
to investigate a primary index. It cannot be used to accelerate access to a
database file.

参数

pxdoc

    Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by px_new().

file

    file is the return value from fopen() with the actual database file as
    parameter. Make sure the database is writable if you plan to update or
    insert records.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

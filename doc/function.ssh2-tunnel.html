===============================================================================

ssh2_tunnel returns a socket stream (e.g, the output of fsockopen). You can use
something basic like this to send a line break and get any output back to test
that it's working:

fwrite($tunnel, "\n");
while (!feof($tunnel)) {
      echo fgets($tunnel, 128);
}

Just a reminder: you can't currently use the socket with any of the cURL
functions.

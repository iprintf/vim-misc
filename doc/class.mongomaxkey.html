The MongoMaxKey class

(PECL mongo >= 1.0.2)

Warning

This extension that defines this class is deprecated. Instead, the MongoDB
extension should be used. Alternatives to this class include:

  • MongoDB\BSON\MaxKey

简介

MongoMaxKey is an special type used by the database that compares greater than
all other possible BSON values. Thus, if a query is sorted by a given field in
ascending order, any document with a MongoMaxKey as its value will be returned
last.

MongoMaxKey has no associated fields, methods, or constants. It is merely the
"greatest" value that can be represented in the database.

    Note: MongoMaxKey is used internally by MongoDB for indexing and sharding.
    There is generally no reason to use this class in an application.

类摘要

MongoMaxKey {
}

Using MongoMaxKey as a value

<?php

$collection->insert(array("task" => "dishes", "doBy" => new MongoMaxKey));
$collection->insert(array("task" => "staff meeting", "doBy" => new MongoDate(
strtotime("+4 days"))));

$cursor = $collection->find()->sort(array("doBy" => 1));

?>

The cursor will return the staff meeting document followed by the dishes
document. The dishes document will always be returned last, regardless of what
else is added to the collection (unless other documents are added with
MongoMaxKey in their "doBy" field).

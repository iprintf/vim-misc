If you do not wish to set up SSL on your active directory, and you are running
on Windows, you can use COM and ADSI to set the new password for a user, or to
active a user:

<?PHP
// to set a user password
  // server is the ldap server
  // newuser_dn is the full dn of the user you want to modify
  // newuser_password is the password you wish to set for the user

    $ADSI = new COM("LDAP:");
    $user = $ADSI->OpenDSObject("LDAP://".$server."/".$newuser_dn, $adminuser, 
$adminpassword, 1);
    $user->SetPassword($newuser_password);
    $user->SetInfo();

// to activate a user
    $ADSI = new COM("LDAP:");
    $user = $ADSI->OpenDSObject("LDAP://".$server."/".$newuser_dn, $adminuser, 
$adminpassword, 1);
    $user->AccountDisabled = false;
    $user->SetInfo();

?>

Here's an easy way to encode AD "unicodepwd" values from linux...

Download and install recode...
http://www.gnu.org/software/recode/recode.html

Then write something like this...
<?php
function ADUnicodePwdValue($plain_txt_value)
{
    return str_replace("\n", "", shell_exec("echo -n '\"" . $plain_txt_value . 
"\"' | recode latin1..utf-16le/base64"));
}

$user["unicodepwd"] = ADUnicodePwdValue("my_password");

?>

[EDITOR thiago NOTE: The following text was sent by boyvanderlaak at gmail dot
com as an important complement]

if you do not have access to your linux box but have Multibyte String enabled
you could try the following for AD 2008:

<?php
$info["unicodePwd"] = mb_convert_encoding('"' . $newPassword . '"', 'utf-16le'
);
?>
===============================================================================

You can use arrays for multiple attributes example:

<?php
$entry[mail] = array("example@example.com","example2@example.com");
$results = ldap_mod_add($ldapConnID,$dn, $entry);
?>
or as i did for creating anew user:
<?php
$adduserAD["objectClass"] = array("top","person","organizationalPerson","user"
);
?>
===============================================================================

Here is some great information from the OpenLDAP FAQs regarding changing a
userPassword attribute with PHP:

http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html

$userpassword = "{SHA}" . base64_encode( pack( "H*", sha1( $pass ) ) );
===============================================================================

this can not be used to change a password on an AD server that requires you to
send the old and new password.

in order to do this use on shuts an sever make an admin-account that allows to
change other ppl pw without suppling the old password first.
===============================================================================

Changing a user password in Active Directory.
Securely connect (using ldaps) to the Active Directory and bind using an
administrator account.

In this example, $userDn contains the dn of the user I want to modify, and $ad
is the Active Directory ldaps connection)

$newPassword = "MyPassword";
$newPassword = "\"" . $newPassword . "\"";
$len = strlen($newPassword);
for ($i = 0; $i < $len; $i++)
        $newPassw .= "{$newPassword{$i}}\000";
$newPassword = $newPassw;
$userdata["unicodepwd"] = $newPassword;
$result = ldap_mod_replace($ad, $userDn, $userdata);
if ($result) echo "User modified!" ;
else echo "There was a problem!";

I found it hard to get a proper encoding for the unicodepwd attribute so this
piece of code might help you ;-)

Sometime,we cannot replace ldap_mod_replace  function  with ldap_mod_del
function and ldap_mod_add fuction .We  don't have permission to delete an
attribute but  we can replace it.
===============================================================================

in openldap 2.0.x you can use method with mod_del/mod_add only if the attribute
have defined EQUALITY rule.
===============================================================================

To modify an attribute with a single value:
  $entry[mail] = "newmail@aelana.com";
  $results = ldap_mod_add($ldapConnID,$dn, $entry);

To modify an attribute with multiple values:
  $entry[mail][] = "newmail@aelana.com";
  $entry[mail][] = "altnewmail@aelana.com";
  $results = ldap_mod_add($ldapConnID,$dn, $entry);

To modify multiple attributes
  $entry[mail][] = "newmail@aelana.com";
  $entry[mail][] = "altnewmail@aelana.com";
  $entry[c]      = "US";
  $results = ldap_mod_add($ldapConnID,$dn, $entry);
===============================================================================

ldap_mod_replace() and ldap_modify() are _exactly_ the same.  So, the comment
that ldap_mod_replace() "performs the modification at the attribute level as
opposed to the object level", has no root in reality.
===============================================================================

if i want to replace the special attribute but i don't replace other attribute
,i just use "ldap_mod_del" and "ldap_mod_add" ,the function seems to that
===============================================================================

Before you modify values in your ldap directory, first make sure that you have
permission to do so.  In openldap adding the following acl in slap.conf will
allow the user to modify their own userpassword.

access to attr=userPassword
        by self write
        by anonymous auth
        by * none
===============================================================================

Using this function to 'replace' an Active Directory password requires the
"Reset Password" security permission as opposed to the "Change Password"
permission (which is assigned by default to SELF)

px_timestamp2string — Converts the timestamp into a string.

说明

string px_timestamp2string ( resource $pxdoc , float $value , string $format )

Turns a timestamp as it stored in the paradox file into human readable format.
Paradox timestamps are the number of miliseconds since 0001-01-02. This
function is just for convenience. It can be easily replaced by some math and
the calendar functions as demonstrated in the following example.

参数

pxdoc

    Resource identifier of the paradox database.

value

    Value as stored in paradox database field of type PX_FIELD_TIME, or
    PX_FIELD_TIMESTAMP.

format

    String format similar to the format used by date(). The placeholders
    support by this function is a subset of those supported by date() (Y, y, m,
    n, d, j, H, h, G, g, i, s, A, a, L).

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Turn a paradox timestamp into a human readable form

<?php
$px = px_new();

/* make up a date as it could be stored in */
/* a date field of a paradox db. */
/* 700000 days since 1.1.0000. */
$days = 700000;

/* Use the calendar functions to print a */
/* human readable format of the date */
echo jdtogregorian($days+1721425)."\n";

/* Turn it into a timestamp as it stored in a paradox database */
/* Timestamps are stored in miliseconds since 0001-01-02 */
$stamp = $days * 86400.0 * 1000.0;
/* Add one hour */
$stamp += 3600000.0;
/* The following will output '7/15/1917 01:00:00'. */
echo px_timestamp2string($px, $stamp, "n/d/Y H:i:s")."\n";

px_delete($px);
?>

以上例程会输出：

7/15/1917
7/15/1917 01:00:00

The Julian day count as passed to jdtogregorian() has a different base of
1.1.4714 b.c. and must therefore be calculated by adding 1721425 to the day
count used in the paradox file. Turning the day count into a timestamp is
easily done by multiplying with 86400000.0 to obtain miliseconds.

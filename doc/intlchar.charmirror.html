IntlChar::charMirror — Get the "mirror-image" character for a code point

说明

public static mixed IntlChar::charMirror ( mixed $codepoint )

Maps the specified character to a "mirror-image" character.

For characters with the Bidi_Mirrored property, implementations sometimes need
a "poor man's" mapping to another Unicode character (code point) such that the
default glyph may serve as the mirror-image of the default glyph of the
specified character. This is useful for text conversion to and from codepages
with visual order, and for displays without glyph selection capabilities.

参数

codepoint

    The integer codepoint value (e.g. 0x2603 for U+2603 SNOWMAN), or the
    character encoded as a UTF-8 string (e.g. "\u{2603}")

返回值

Returns another Unicode code point that may serve as a mirror-image substitute,
or codepoint itself if there is no such mapping or codepoint does not have the
Bidi_Mirrored property.

The return type will be integer unless the code point was passed as a UTF-8 
string, in which case a string will be returned.

范例

Example #1 Testing different code points

<?php
var_dump(IntlChar::charMirror("A"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charMirror("<"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charMirror("("));
?>

以上例程会输出：

string(1) "E"
string(1) ">"
string(2) ")"

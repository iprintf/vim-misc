openssl_x509_fingerprint

(PHP 5.6, PHP 7)

openssl_x509_fingerprint — Calculates the fingerprint, or digest, of a given
X.509 certificate

说明

bool openssl_x509_fingerprint ( mixed $x509 [, string $hash_algorithm = "sha1"
[, bool $raw_output = FALSE ]] )

openssl_x509_fingerprint() returns the digest of x509 as a string.

参数

x509

    参见密钥／证书参数以获取有效值列表。

hash_algorithm

    The hash algorithm to use, e.g. "md5" or "sha1"

raw_output

    When set to TRUE, outputs raw binary data. FALSE outputs lowercase hexits.

返回值

Returns a string containing the calculated certificate fingerprint as lowercase
hexits unless raw_output is set to TRUE in which case the raw binary
representation of the message digest is returned.

Returns FALSE on failure.

===============================================================================

The manual is not constistent at this point. On one hand, it describes the
return as digest/fingerprint of a cert, on the other hand it says:
bool openssl_x509_fingerprint( … )

On PHP 5.6.5, I only get the bool return (1 or 0).

===============================================================================

As per http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30688 the $rpath argument is ignored, and
since the (as of now) 4 year old bug is tagged WONTFIX in the bug tracker, this
function is effectively deprecated in favour of mail().
===============================================================================

make sure you've correctly setup the SMTP parameters in php.ini
and aslo make sure that the SMTP server accepts relay

for some mail servers, you have to open up an imap stream, log in, and then you
can send mail through imap_mail
===============================================================================

Extending the above note.
When the socket connection is stablished, it works exactly as if you had
openned a telnet connection to the news server. If you don't know what kind of
headers you have to send to the news server, then I'll suggest that you better
give it a try and play with a telnet connection like this:

telenet news.servername.com 119

eaxmple:

telnet news.euroconnect.dk 119
Trying 195.184.44.30...
Connected to news.euroconnect.net (195.184.44.30).
Escape character is '^]'.
200 news.euroconnect.net (Typhoon v1.2.1)

then you'll receive confirmation from the server that you are connected. Now
type "help" and enter, and you'll see what commands are supported.

eaxmle:

help
100 Legal Commands
  article [<messageid>|number]
  authinfo type value
  body [<messageid>|number]
  date
  group newsgroup
  head [<messageid>|number]
  help
  last
  list [active wildmat|active.times|counts wildmat]
  list [overview.fmt|newsgroups wildmat]
  listgroup newsgroup
  mode reader
  newgroups yyyymmdd hhmmss [GMT]
  newnews newsgroups yyyymmdd hhmmss [GMT]
  next
  post
  stat [<messageid>|number]
  xhdr field [range]
  xover [range]
  xpat field range pattern
  quit

If you want to post a message, you can start by entring the "post" command.

example:

post
340 Send Article to be Posted

From here you can start to enter the header information.
The most important headers are:
From:
Subject:
Newsgroup:

after the ":" a "white space" must follow.

If you are posting the multipart message then remember
MIME-Version: 1.0

This one is also one of the important headers when you are posting a multipart
message. The boundary must follow the content type in the same line.

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="------------4A11A9ABCFCA70DD4E0C3605"

Take a look at the article below to find out more about headers and packing of
the message.

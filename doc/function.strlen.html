strlen — 获取字符串长度

说明

int strlen ( string $string )

返回给定的字符串 string 的长度。

参数

string

    需要计算长度的字符串。

返回值

成功则返回字符串 string 的长度；如果 string 为空，则返回 0。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.3.0 Prior versions treated arrays as the string Array, thus returning a
      string length of 5 and emitting an E_NOTICE level error.

范例

Example #1 strlen() 范例

<?php
$str = 'abcdef';
echo strlen($str); // 6

$str = ' ab cd ';
echo strlen($str); // 7
?>

注释

    Note:

    strlen() returns the number of bytes rather than the number of characters
    in a string.

    Note:

    strlen() returns NULL when executed on arrays, and an E_WARNING level error
    is emitted.

The easiest way to determine the character count of a UTF8 string is to pass
the text through utf8_decode() first:

<?php
$length = strlen(utf8_decode($s));
?>

utf8_decode() converts characters that are not in ISO-8859-1 to '?', which, for
the purpose of counting, is quite alright.
===============================================================================

I want to share something seriously important for newbies or beginners of PHP
who plays with strings of UTF8 encoded characters or the languages like:
Arabic, Persian, Pashto, Dari, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional),
Japanese, Vietnamese, Urdu, Macedonian, Lithuanian, and etc.
As the manual says: "strlen() returns the number of bytes rather than the
number of characters in a string.", so if you want to get the number of
characters in a string of UTF8 so use mb_strlen() instead of strlen().

Example:

<?php
// the Arabic (Hello) string below is: 59 bytes and 32 characters
$utf8 = "السلام علیکم ورحمة الله وبرکاته!";

var_export( strlen($utf8) ); // 59
echo "<br>";
var_export( mb_strlen($utf8, 'utf8') ); // 32
?>
===============================================================================

I would like to demonstrate that you need more than just this function in order
to truly test for an empty string. The reason being that <?php strlen(null); ?>
will return 0. So how do you know if the value was null, or truly an empty
string?

<?php
$foo = null;
$len = strlen(null);
$bar = '';

echo "Length: " . strlen($foo) . "<br>";
echo "Length: $len <br>";
echo "Length: " . strlen(null) . "<br>";

if (strlen($foo) === 0) echo 'Null length is Zero <br>';
if ($len === 0) echo 'Null length is still Zero <br>';

if (strlen($foo) == 0 && !is_null($foo)) echo '!is_null(): $foo is truly an
empty string <br>';
else echo '!is_null(): $foo is probably null <br>';

if (strlen($foo) == 0 && isset($foo)) echo 'isset(): $foo is truly an empty
string <br>';
else echo 'isset(): $foo is probably null <br>';

if (strlen($bar) == 0 && !is_null($bar)) echo '!is_null(): $bar is truly an
empty string <br>';
else echo '!is_null(): $foo is probably null <br>';

if (strlen($bar) == 0 && isset($bar)) echo 'isset(): $bar is truly an empty
string <br>';
else echo 'isset(): $foo is probably null <br>';
?>

// Begin Output:
Length: 0
Length: 0
Length: 0

Null length is Zero
Null length is still Zero

!is_null(): $foo is probably null
isset(): $foo is probably null

!is_null(): $bar is truly an empty string
isset(): $bar is truly an empty string
// End Output

So it would seem you need either is_null() or isset() in addition to strlen()
if you care whether or not the original value was null.
===============================================================================

We just ran into what we thought was a bug but turned out to be a documented
difference in behavior between PHP 5.2 & 5.3.  Take the following code example:

<?php

$attributes = array('one', 'two', 'three');

if (strlen($attributes) == 0 && !is_bool($attributes)) {
    echo "We are in the 'if'\n";  //  PHP 5.3
} else {
    echo "We are in the 'else'\n";  //  PHP 5.2
}

?>

This is because in 5.2 strlen will automatically cast anything passed to it as
a string, and casting an array to a string yields the string "Array".  In 5.3,
this changed, as noted in the following point in the backward incompatible
changes in 5.3 (http://www.php.net/manual/en/migration53.incompatible.php):

"The newer internal parameter parsing API has been applied across all the
extensions bundled with PHP 5.3.x. This parameter parsing API causes functions
to return NULL when passed incompatible parameters. There are some exceptions
to this rule, such as the get_class() function, which will continue to return
FALSE on error."

So, in PHP 5.3, strlen($attributes) returns NULL, while in PHP 5.2, strlen
($attributes) returns the integer 5.  This likely affects other functions, so
if you are getting different behaviors or new bugs suddenly, check if you have
upgraded to 5.3 (which we did recently), and then check for some warnings in
your logs like this:

strlen() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /var/www/sis/lib/
functions/advanced_search_lib.php on line 1028

If so, then you are likely experiencing this changed behavior.
===============================================================================

Attention with utf8:
$foo = "bär";
strlen($foo) will return 4 and not 3 as expected..
===============================================================================

PHP's strlen function behaves differently than the C strlen function in terms
of its handling of null bytes ('\0'). 

In PHP, a null byte in a string does NOT count as the end of the string, and
any null bytes are included in the length of the string.

For example, in PHP:

strlen( "te\0st" ) = 5

In C, the same call would return 2.

Thus, PHP's strlen function can be used to find the number of bytes in a binary
string (for example, binary data returned by base64_decode).
===============================================================================

Beware: strlen() counts new line characters at the end of a string, too!

<?php
  $a = "123\n";
  echo "<p>".strlen($a)."</p>";
?>

The above code will output 4.
===============================================================================

function limit_text( $text, $limit = 100000000000 ) {
        if ( strlen ( $text ) < $limit ) {
            return $text;
        }
        $split_words = explode(' ', $text );
        $out = null;
        foreach ( $split_words as $word ) {
            if ( ( strlen( $word ) > $limit ) && $out == null ) {
                return substr( $word, 0, $limit )."...";
            }
           
            if (( strlen( $out ) + strlen( $word ) ) > $limit) {
                return $out . "...";
            }           
            $out.=" " . $word;
        }
        return $out;
    }

echo limit_text("hello world lorem ipsum",10);

This is not always true. strlen() might be shadowed by mb_strlen().
If that is the case it might treat binary data as unocode string and return
wrong value (I just found it out after fighting with egroupware email
attachment handling bug).

So, if your data is binary I would suggest using somthing like this (parts of
the code from egroupware):

<?php
$has_mbstring = extension_loaded('mbstring') ||@dl(PHP_SHLIB_PREFIX.'mbstring.'
.PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);
$has_mb_shadow = (int) ini_get('mbstring.func_overload');

if ($has_mbstring && ($has_mb_shadow & 2) ) {
   $size = mb_strlen($this->output_data,'latin1');
} else {
   $size = strlen($this->output_data);
}
?>

When dealing with submitted forms that you've imposed a character limit on, you
must remember that functions that count characters consider "\r\n" to be two
characters.

<?php
//These will both output 2.
echo strlen("\r\n");
echo mb_strlen("\r\n");
?>

If I had thought of this starting out, I would have saved myself several hours
of trouble trying to get php to cut a message to the same length that my
auxiliary javascript validation imposed on it.

Simple code for palindrome
<?PHP
$str='racecar';
echo $str.'   ';
$len=strlen($str)-1;
$new='';
for($i=$len;$i>=0;$i--){
$new.=$str[$i];
}
echo $new;
?>
===============================================================================

Just a precisation, maybe obvious, about the strlen() behaviour: with binary
strings (i.e. returned by the pack() finction) is made a byte count... so
strlen returns the number of bytes contained in the binary string.
===============================================================================

I've found this quite peculiar error (I think it might be truncating something,
but not sure why and where that occurs)

The string is the amount of unique shuffles of a deck of cards, and in it's raw
form it's this

if you however use strlen() to count this, it will return 19, which clearly the
string is longer than

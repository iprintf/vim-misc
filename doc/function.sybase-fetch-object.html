sybase_fetch_object — Fetch a row as an object

说明

object sybase_fetch_object ( resource $result [, mixed $object ] )

sybase_fetch_object() is similar to sybase_fetch_assoc(), with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to sybase_fetch_array(), and almost as
quick as sybase_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).

参数

result

object

    Use the second object to specify the type of object you want to return. If
    this parameter is omitted, the object will be of type stdClass.

返回值

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

范例

Example #1 sybase_fetch_object() return as Foo

<?php
    class Foo {
        var $foo, $bar, $baz;
    }

    // {...]
    $qrh= sybase_query('SELECT foo, bar, baz FROM example');
    $foo= sybase_fetch_object($qrh, 'Foo');
    $bar= sybase_fetch_object($qrh, new Foo());
    // {...]
?>

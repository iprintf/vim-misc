User Contributed Notes 1 note

===============================================================================

This method should release the exclusive lock that was acquired by the open()
method.

Note that this will effectively serialize parallel requests, which affects
performance for a single user session.

Not locking the resource would on the other hand allow for race conditions if
two or more parallel requests change the session data.

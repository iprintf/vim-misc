PDO_MYSQL DSN — Connecting to MySQL databases

说明

The PDO_MYSQL Data Source Name (DSN) is composed of the following elements:

DSN prefix

    The DSN prefix is mysql:.

host

    The hostname on which the database server resides.

port

    The port number where the database server is listening.

dbname

    The name of the database.

unix_socket

    The MySQL Unix socket (shouldn't be used with host or port).

charset

    The character set. See the character set concepts documentation for more
    information.

    Prior to PHP 5.3.6, this element was silently ignored. The same behaviour
    can be partly replicated with the PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND driver
    option, as the following example shows.

    Warning

    The method in the below example can only be used with character sets that
    share the same lower 7 bit representation as ASCII, such as ISO-8859-1 and
    UTF-8. Users using character sets that have different representations (such
    as UTF-16 or Big5) must use the charset option provided in PHP 5.3.6 and
    later versions.

    Example #1 Setting the connection character set to UTF-8 prior to PHP 5.3.6

    <?php
    $dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb';
    $username = 'username';
    $password = 'password';
    $options = array(
        PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES utf8',
    ); 

    $dbh = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
    ?>

更新日志

版本                      说明
5.3.6 Prior to version 5.3.6, charset was ignored.

范例

Example #2 PDO_MYSQL DSN examples

The following example shows a PDO_MYSQL DSN for connecting to MySQL databases:

mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb

More complete examples:

mysql:host=localhost;port=3307;dbname=testdb
mysql:unix_socket=/tmp/mysql.sock;dbname=testdb

注释

    Note: Unix only:

    When the host name is set to "localhost", then the connection to the server
    is made thru a domain socket. If PDO_MYSQL is compiled against
    libmysqlclient then the location of the socket file is at libmysqlclient's
    compiled in location. If PDO_MYSQL is compiled against mysqlnd a default
    socket can be set thru the pdo_mysql.default_socket setting.

===============================================================================

I have tested this and found that the "dbname" field is optional.  Which is a
good thing if you must first create the db.

After creating a db be sure to exec a "use dbname;"  command, or else use fully
specified table references.
===============================================================================

It should be noted that unix_socket can also be used for named pipes under
Windows.

<?php
$pipeName = 'my_awesome_pipe';
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';
$dbh = new PDO('mysql:unix_socket='.$pipeName, $username, $password);
?>
===============================================================================

If you are having problems accessing a remote MYSQL database, the solution is
to make sure that you remove any white-space after "mysql:"

Change this...:
mysql: host=remote;

...to this:
mysql:host=remote;

See original solution here:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/25432156
===============================================================================

It appears that internally the host string infers a default of "localhost",
e.g. this appears to work as a valid $dsn: mysql:host=;port=3306
===============================================================================

Even though pdo_mysql accepts an additional "charset" parameter in the DSN (see
mysql_driver.c:442), as of PHP 5.2.9 it does not do anything with it.

A possible workaround to set the charset to UTF-8, for example, could be:
<?php

    $dbh = new PDO("mysql:$connstr",  $user, $password);

    $dbh -> exec("set names utf8");

?>
===============================================================================

on unix machines create a php file with the following content:

<?php>
phpinfo();
?>

and execute it. Search for MYSQL_SOCKET or mysqli.default_socket to get the
correct path for unixsocket= ...

ibase_pconnect — Open a persistent connection to an InterBase database

说明

resource ibase_pconnect ([ string $database [, string $username [, string
$password [, string $charset [, int $buffers [, int $dialect [, string $role [,
int $sync ]]]]]]]] )

Opens a persistent connection to an InterBase database.

ibase_pconnect() acts very much like ibase_connect() with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function will first try to find a (persistent) link
that's already opened with the same parameters. If one is found, an identifier
for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the InterBase server will not be closed when the
execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(ibase_close() will not close links established by ibase_pconnect()). This type
of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

参数

database

    The database argument has to be a valid path to database file on the server
    it resides on. If the server is not local, it must be prefixed with either
    'hostname:' (TCP/IP), '//hostname/' (NetBEUI) or 'hostname@' (IPX/SPX),
    depending on the connection protocol used.

username

    The user name. Can be set with the ibase.default_user php.ini directive.

password

    The password for username. Can be set with the ibase.default_password
    php.ini directive.

charset

    charset is the default character set for a database.

buffers

    buffers is the number of database buffers to allocate for the server-side
    cache. If 0 or omitted, server chooses its own default.

dialect

    dialect selects the default SQL dialect for any statement executed within a
    connection, and it defaults to the highest one supported by client
    libraries. Functional only with InterBase 6 and up.

role

    Functional only with InterBase 5 and up.

sync

返回值

Returns an InterBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

===============================================================================

To make a connection to a firebird database with pconnect many people like to
use the SYSDBA, or database owner.
example:
$dbConnection = ibase_pconnect('path to db','SYSDBA','masterkey');

The above is fine unless you want to login in various user that have different
permissions. To use permission make roles in the database, either as the
database creator (or SYSDBA) and grant the roles to the various users.

If you login with...
$dbConnection = ibase_pconnect('path to db', 'USERNAME', 'userpassword');
...interbase will default your user to the PUBLIC role, which is created when
the database is create and usualy has select rights on tables only. To get the
proper role you will need to use all the parameters, like this...
$user='USERNAME';
$password='userpassword';
$role='MANAGER_HR';
$dbConnection = ibase_pconnect('path to db', $user, $password, '', 0, 3, $role,
0);

BTW - The "path to db", is formed like this...
---------------------
'localhost:c:/firebird/test_db/test.fdb'
---------------------

reading the interbase material, it states 3 connection methods, PHP appears to
have selected the tcp type for us. So you can use localhost, or I suspect(never
tested this myself) a ip address.

===============================================================================

If you're facing problems on Windows Servers running PHP 5.3 and newer, where
this function quits with an "Unable to resolve file path" Error, here is a
Workaround which isn't posted on the Bug site yet:

Add this before you use the openURI()-function:

<?php
touch($uri);
$uri = realpath($uri);
?>

This Bug appears in the following cases:

$xml->openURI('file.xml'); -> ok!
$xml->openURI('../file.xml'); -> ok!
$xml->openURI('xml/file.xml'); -> DON'T WORK!
$xml->openURI('../xml/file.xml'); -> DON'T WORK!
===============================================================================

Want to write xml-data directly to the user instead of memory or file?
This will do:
<?php
$out =new XMLWriter();
$out->openURI('php://output');
?>
===============================================================================

I wanted to stream a XML file directly to the user and having him prompted to
save it without displaying the content, but when using

<?php
$out =new XMLWriter();
$out->openURI('php://output');
?>

the user's browser was displaying the file contents instead of prompting the
user with a filesave window.

To have the XML file stream saved directly to the user without being displayed
by the browser, you shoud add:

<?php
header("Content-Type: text/html/force-download");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='file_name.xml'");
$out =new XMLWriter();
$out->openURI('php://output');
?>

This will prompt the user with a dialog box to save 'file_name.xml' on his
disk, and will not display the content of the streamed XML.
===============================================================================

Reproduced on Windows:

If you get an exception when you try to handle the created file (rename, move
etc.) you should unset the XMLWriter instance.

In other case you'll get an exception because the XMLWriter process holds
access to this file.

<?php
$xml = new \XMLWriter();
$xml->openUri(...)
...
$xml->flush();

unset($xml); //important!

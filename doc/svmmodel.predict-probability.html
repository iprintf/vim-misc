SVMModel::predict_probability — Return class probabilities for previous unseen
data

说明

public float SVMModel::predict_probability ( array $data )

This function accepts an array of data and attempts to predict the class, as
with the predict function. Additionally, however, this function returns an
array of probabilities, one per class in the model, which represent the
estimated chance of the data supplied being a member of that class. Requires
that the model to be used has been trained with the probability parameter set
to true.

参数

data

    The array to be classified. This should be a series of key => value pairs
    in increasing key order, but not necessarily continuous.

probabilities

    The supplied value will be filled with the probabilities. This will be
    either null, in the case of a model without probability information, or an
    array where the index is the class name and the value the predicted
    probability.

返回值

Float the predicted value. This will be a class label in the case of
classification, a real value in the case of regression. Throws SVMException on
error

===============================================================================

For the series we’ll assume we have a collection named posts populated with 500
documents having the following structure:

{
    "_id": ObjectId("5146bb52d852470060001f4"),
    "comments": {
        "0": "This is the first comment",
        "1": "This is the second comment"
    },
    "post_likes": 40,
    "post_tags": {
        "0": "MongoDB",
        "1": "Tutorial",
        "2": "Indexing"
    },
    "post_text": "Hello Readers!! This is my post text",
    "post_type": "private",
    "user_name": "Mark Anthony"
}

The hint() method can be used to force MongoDB to use an index we specify and
override the default selection and query optimization process. You can specify
the field names used in the index as a argument as shown below:

<?php
// query to find posts with type public and 100 likes
// use hint() to force MongoDB to use the index we created
$cursor = $collection
    ->find(
        array(
            "post_type" => "public",
            "post_likes" => 100
        )
    )
    ->hint(
        array(
            "post_type" => 1,
            "post_likes" => 1
        )
    );
?>

This ensures the query uses the compound index defined on the post_type and
post_likes fields.

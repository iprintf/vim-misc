(PECL wincache >= 1.1.0)

wincache_lock — Acquires an exclusive lock on a given key

说明

bool wincache_lock ( string $key [, bool $isglobal = false ] )

Obtains an exclusive lock on a given key. The execution of the current script
will be blocked until the lock can be obtained. Once the lock is obtained, the
other scripts that try to request the lock by using the same key will be
blocked, until the current script releases the lock by using wincache_unlock().

Warning

Using of the wincache_lock() and wincache_unlock() can cause deadlocks when
executing PHP scripts in a multi-process environment like FastCGI. Do not use
these functions unless you are absolutely sure you need to use them. For the
majority of the operations on the user cache it is not necessary to use these
functions.

参数

key

    Name of the key in the cache to get the lock on.

isglobal

    Controls whether the scope of the lock is system-wide or local. Local locks
    are scoped to the application pool in IIS FastCGI case or to all php
    processes that have the same parent process identifier.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Using wincache_lock()

<?php
$fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");
if (wincache_lock(“lock_txt_lock”)) { // do an exclusive lock
    ftruncate($fp, 0); // truncate file
    fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
    wincache_unlock(“lock_txt_lock”); // release the lock
} else {
    echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
}
fclose($fp);
?>

===============================================================================

User should be aware that character '\' is not allowed as part of lock name.
The reason why backslash is not allowed is because we are using CreateMutex
call as described at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682411(VS.85
).aspx. As per this article third parameter cannot have '\' character which is
the lock name.

This means below code will not work.

<?php

   $ret_val = wincache_lock("C:\WINDOWS\Temp/cache");
   echo $ret_val . '<br>';
   $ret_val = wincache_unlock("C:\WINDOWS\Temp/cache");
   echo $ret_val . '<br>';

?>

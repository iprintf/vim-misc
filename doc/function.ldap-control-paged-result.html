ldap_control_paged_result — Send LDAP pagination control

说明

bool ldap_control_paged_result ( resource $link , int $pagesize [, bool
$iscritical = false [, string $cookie = "" ]] )

Enable LDAP pagination by sending the pagination control (page size,
cookie...).

参数

link

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

pagesize

    The number of entries by page.

iscritical

    Indicates whether the pagination is critical or not. If true and if the
    server doesn't support pagination, the search will return no result.

cookie

    An opaque structure sent by the server (ldap_control_paged_result_response
    ()).

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

The example below show the retrieval of the first page of a search paginated
with one entry by page.

Example #1 LDAP pagination

<?php
     // $ds is a valid link identifier (see ldap_connect)
     ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);

     $dn        = 'ou=example,dc=org';
     $filter    = '(|(sn=Doe*)(givenname=John*))';
     $justthese = array('ou', 'sn', 'givenname', 'mail');

     // enable pagination with a page size of 1.
     ldap_control_paged_result($ds, 1);

     $sr = ldap_search($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);

     $info = ldap_get_entries($ds, $sr);

     echo $info['count'] . ' entries returned' . PHP_EOL;

The example below show the retrieval of all the result paginated with 100
entries by page.

Example #2 LDAP pagination

<?php
     // $ds is a valid link identifier (see ldap_connect)
     ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);

     $dn        = 'ou=example,dc=org';
     $filter    = '(|(sn=Doe*)(givenname=John*))';
     $justthese = array('ou', 'sn', 'givenname', 'mail');

     // enable pagination with a page size of 100.
     $pageSize = 100;

     $cookie = '';
     do {
         ldap_control_paged_result($ds, $pageSize, true, $cookie);

         $result  = ldap_search($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);
         $entries = ldap_get_entries($ds, $result);
             
         foreach ($entries as $e) {
             echo $e['dn'] . PHP_EOL;
         }

         ldap_control_paged_result_response($ds, $result, $cookie);
       
     } while($cookie !== null && $cookie != '');

注释

    Note:

    Pagination control is a LDAPv3 protocol feature.

===============================================================================

Paged results, as specified in the RFC 2696, does not allow to get over the
server sizeLimit. The RFC clearly states "If the page size is greater than or
equal to the sizeLimit value, the server should ignore the control as the
request can be satisfied in a single page".
With OpenLDAP, you will not get more than the sizeLimit number of entries with
paged results.
===============================================================================

If you did a paged search operation and want to do any other read operation on
LDAP, you need to reset it, otherwise you will experience LDAP errors (code 12,
for instance).

<?php
…
ldap_control_paged_result($link, 0);
…
?>
===============================================================================

I was able to get these functions to work successfully with Active Directory. 
When I first tried it, ldap_search kept returning a Not Supported reply from
the server.  I finally figured out that I needed to include

ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);

in my code, so that AD would let me page results.  Make sure you're using a
compatible protocol.

Hope this note helps someone else.
===============================================================================

While another note suggests resetting the control paged result by passing in `0
` (zero), it actually still prevents any further queries being ran during the
same request.

You actually need to set it to a large number to run further queries it seems.
For example:

<?php
ldap_control_paged_result($connection, 100, true, $cookie);

// Run the search
...

// What is supposed to work (reset)
ldap_control_paged_result($connection, 0, false, $cookie);

// What actually works
ldap_control_paged_result($connection, 1000, false, $cookie);
?>

In the above method, 1000 is just a placeholder, but this seems to actually
**limit** further queries to this amount of results, so if you set it to `1`,
then you'll only receive **one** result for any further queries during the same
request.
===============================================================================

You may need to do an ldap_bind before running ldap_control_paged_result to get
this to work:

$conn = ldap_connect("you_ip");
ldap_set_option($conn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
ldap_bind("your_connection_info");       
ldap_control_paged_result($conn, $pageSize, true, $cookie)

Without doing an ldap_bind, I kept getting the error "Critical extension is
unavailable". I don't if this is standard knowledge, but knowing this would
have saved me days of frustration.
===============================================================================

So how do you now sort the entire result? It appears you can't use ldap_sort as
it uses the search resource which is within the loop.

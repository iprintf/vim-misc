SessionHandler::destroy — Destroy a session

说明

public bool SessionHandler::destroy ( string $session_id )

Destroys a session. Called internally by PHP with session_regenerate_id()
(assuming the $destroy is set to TRUE, by session_destroy() or when 
session_decode() fails.

This method wraps the internal PHP save handler defined in the
session.save_handler ini setting that was set before this handler was set by 
session_set_save_handler().

If this class is extended by inheritiance, calling the parent destroy method
will invoke the wrapper for this method and therefor invoke the associated
internal callback. This allows this method to be overidden and or intercepted
and filtered.

For more information on what this method is expected to do, please refer to the
documentation at SessionHandlerInterface::destroy().

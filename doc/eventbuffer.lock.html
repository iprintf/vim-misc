EventBuffer::lock — Acquires a lock on buffer

说明

public void EventBuffer::lock ( void )

Acquires a lock on buffer. Can be used in pair with EventBuffer::unlock() to
make a set of operations atomic, i.e. thread-safe. Note, it is not needed to
lock buffers for individual operations. When locking is enabled(see 
EventBuffer::enableLocking() ), individual operations on event buffers are
already atomic.

参数

返回值

没有返回值。

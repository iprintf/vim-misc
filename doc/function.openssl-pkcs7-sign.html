openssl_pkcs7_sign — Sign an S/MIME message

说明

bool openssl_pkcs7_sign ( string $infilename , string $outfilename , mixed
$signcert , mixed $privkey , array $headers [, int $flags = PKCS7_DETACHED [, 
string $extracerts ]] )

openssl_pkcs7_sign() takes the contents of the file named infilename and signs
them using the certificate and its matching private key specified by signcert
and privkey parameters.

参数

infilename

outfilename

signcert

privkey

headers

    headers is an array of headers that will be prepended to the data after it
    has been signed (see openssl_pkcs7_encrypt() for more information about the
    format of this parameter).

flags

    flags can be used to alter the output - see PKCS7 constants.

extracerts

    extracerts specifies the name of a file containing a bunch of extra
    certificates to include in the signature which can for example be used to
    help the recipient to verify the certificate that you used.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

Amongst the many discussions about signing or encrypting email by itself, none
really discuss the pain of having an email BOTH signed AND encrypted.

According to RFC 2311, you can encrypt then sign or sign then encrypt. However,
it depends on the client in which you are programming for. In my experience, in
Outlook 2000, it prefers it Encrypt then Sign. While in Outlook 2003, it is
Sign then Encrypt. Generally, you want Sign then Encrypt, as it seems most
logical from a snail-mail piece point of view. You first sign a letter than put
it in an envelope. Certain clients complain if you do it in an order it does
not like, so you may want to experiement with it.

When you perform the first function, do NOT put in any headers in the headers
array parameters, you want to put it in the SECOND function you want to
perform. If you put the headers in the first function, the second function will
hide it from the mail servers. You do not want that. Here I will sign then
encrypt.

<?php
// Setup mail headers.
$headers = array("To" => "someone@nowhere.net",
     "From" => "noone@somewhere.net",
     "Subject" => "A signed and encrypted message.");

// Sign the message first
openssl_pkcs7_sign("msg.txt","signed.txt",
     "signing_cert.pem",array("private_key.pem",
     "password"),array());

// Get the public key certificate.
$pubkey = file_get_contents("cert.pem");

//encrypt the message, now put in the headers.
openssl_pkcs7_encrypt("signed.txt", "enc.txt",
     $pubkey,$headers,0,1);

$data = file_get_contents("enc.txt");

// separate header and body, to use with mail function
//  unfortunate but required, else we have two sets of headers
//  and the email client doesn't decode the attachment
$parts = explode("\n\n", $data, 2);

// send mail (headers in the Headers parameter will override those
//  generated for the To & Subject parameters)
mail($mail, $subject, $parts[1], $parts[0]);
?>

Note that if you use a function that picks up the data from the disk to be used
in another function in your program, remember that you may have used the
explode("\n\n",$data,2) function which may have removed the spacing between the
header and the message content.

When you take the signed message and feed it in to the encryption part, you
have to remember that the line spacing must also be fed AS PART OF THE MESSAGE
BODY! If you plan to sign then encrypt, do not feed the header output from the
signing into the encrypting as part of the headers array parameter! The output
of the signing should stay as part of the message body being encrypted. (And
the same is true if you are doing the reverse of encrypting then signing.) An
example of both the signing and encryption function made in to a routine for
reusability, and then called to sign and encrypt a message.

THIS IS WRONG!:
<?php
// [0] of Array contains headers of message. [1] of Array contains signed body
of message.
$signedOutputArray = signMessage($inputMessage,$headers);

// [0] of Array contains headers of message and the signing.
// [1] of Array contains encrypted body of message without the signing header.
$signedAndEncryptedArray = encryptMessage($signedOutputArray[1],
     $signedOutputArray[0]);

mail($emailAddr,$subject,$signedAndEncryptedArray[1],
      $signedAndEncryptedArray[0]);
?>

THIS IS CORRECT!
<?php
// [0] of Array contains headers of signing.
// [1] of Array contains signed body of message.
$signedOutputArray = signMessage($inputMessage,array());

// [0] of Array contains headers of message.
// [1] of Array contains encrypted contents of both the signed message and its
headers of the signing.
$signedAndEncryptedArray =
     encryptMessage($signedOutputArray[0] . "\n\n" . $signedOutputArray[1],
$headers);

mail($emailAddr,$subject,$signedAndEncryptedArray[1],
     $signedAndEncryptedArray[0]);
?>

I also spent hours when trying to find the reason of error:
"error getting private key".

Sometimes this error appeared, sometimes not.

My solution is using the realpath() for every parameter of openssl_pkcs7_sign.
In my case the code looks like:

<?php
$Certif_path = 'certificate/mycertificate.pem';

$clearfile = "certificate/random_name";
$encfile = $clearfile . ".enc";
$clearfile = $clearfile . ".txt";

// ----
// -- fill $clearfile with the mail to be signed ...
// ----

openssl_pkcs7_sign(realpath($clearfile),
                           realpath('.').'/'.$encfile, // because $encfile does
not exist yet we cannot use realpath($encfile);
                           'file://'.realpath($Certif_path),
                          
                           array('file://'.realpath($Certif_path), PUBLIC_KEY),
                          
                           array("To" => TO_EMAIL,
                                 "From" => FROM_EMAIL,
                                 "Subject" => ""),
                          
                           PKCS7_DETACHED));

?>

This command doesn't work correctly on WIN32 with IIS. Mails aren t interpreted
correctly by IIS SMTP Server (and by Outlook too). The reason is that UNIX and
WINDOWS interpret the  enter to the next line  ascii code in a different way.

Below I present an improved code:

<?php

$data = <<<EOD

Testing 123

This is a test

Test

EOD;

//save the message to a file
$fp = fopen("msg.txt","w");
fwrite($fp,$data);
fclose($fp);

//sign the message using the sender's keys
openssl_pkcs7_sign("msg.txt", "signed.eml", "file://c:/max/cert.pem",
array("file://c:/max/priv.pem","your_password"),
array("To" => "recipient <recipients@mail.com>",
"From" => "sender <sender@mail.com>",
"Subject" => "Order Notification - Test"),PKCS7_DETACHED,"c:\max\
extra_cert.pem");

$file_arry = file("signed.eml");
$file = join ("", $file_arry);
$message = preg_replace("/\r\n|\r|\n/", "\r\n", $file);

$fp = fopen("c:\Inetpub\mailroot\Pickup\signed.eml", "wb");
flock($fp, 2);
fputs($fp, $message);                                                    
flock($fp, 3);
fclose($fp);

?>

Besides, if you want to use the keys created with Windows, you should export
them (from IE) to the form of PKCS#12 file (*.pfx).

Install OpenSSLWin32 from
http://www.shininglightpro.com/search.php?searchname=Win32+OpenSSL

execute: openssl.exe

enter the commands:

pkcs12 -in <pfx-file> -nokeys -out <pem-certs-file>

pkcs12 -in <pfx-file> -nocerts -nodes -out <pem-key-file>

Next export from IE Root CA certificate as Base-64 *.cer and rename the file to
*.pem

And that's all!
===============================================================================

A note about the $flags parameter: PKCS7_BINARY has 2 effects:
* converts LF to CR+LF, as described in http://www.php.net/manual/en/
openssl.pkcs7.flags.php
* it creates an opaque pkcs7 signature (p7m)

If you want to prevent the LF->CR+LF conversion *and* still have a detached
signature (p7s), use PKCS7_BINARY | PKCS7_DETACHED (both flags are set).

If the signed message is already MIME multi-part, using both flags as described
above seems to be the right solution to assemble the message properly. Without
any flags, apparently only some of the LF characters are converted. In a
specific scenario (the local MTA is Postfix and then the message goes through
sendmail on another machine), the MIME boundaries get scrambled in sendmail.
However, this doesn't seem to happen if the local MTA is sendmail.
===============================================================================

I would like to make a modification from my previous note. Some clients prefer
a certain order in which messages should be signed and encrypted (if both is
desired). Newer email clients, such as Thunderbird and Outlook 2003 will accept
the most secure method of "sign -> encrypt -> sign again".

Why?

The first signing authenticates the message saying that you did indeed write
it. Then the email is encrypted so that only the recipient can open and read
it. Then the second signing ensure confidentiality by identifying that the
person encrypting is the one whom encrypted it, a message intended for the
decrypting person. This is the most secure method. This ensures:
Non-Repudiation of message (first sign), Confidentiality (encrypt), and Context
Integrity [you were intended to be addressed] (second sign).

If you only sign then encrypt, there is no way you can guarantee that (aside
from the contents of the letter, headers are placed in plain text outside the
message) that the message was intended for you by the original sender. For
example:

Bob signs a love letter and encrypts it to Amy saying only "I love you. --
Bob". Amy decrypts it, sees the message (and plays a joke) and forwards the
message to John using John's public key, re-encrypting, but not tampering with
the message contents keeping the signature valid. This allows Amy to make it
look like Bob sent John a love letter and that Bob loves John, as you cannot
verify whom sent it during encryption. That is not what you want!

This is also analogous to someone taking a government document, put it in an
envelope themselves and write the government address in the return address and
send it to you. You know the letter is written by the government, but you don't
know for sure whether the government sent it to you directly or was opened and
relayed.

While encrypting then signing has a problem, this is affectively signing on the
envelope of a snail mail piece. I know you sent it, but is the message really
from you? Or are you forwarding it?

Sign - Encrypt - Sign Again method will make the first sign show that you know
the writer of the message is the person, encrypt it to keep others from reading
it, sign again to indicate the message was not relayed and that the sender
intended to sent the mail to address you.

Just make sure the headers of the mail is applied in the last step and not the
second or third step.

For more information about the security and integrity risks of this situation,

Working example:

<?php

$data = <<< EOF
Content-Type: text/plain;
    charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

You have my authorization to spend 10,000 on dinner expenses.
The CEO
EOF;

$fp = fopen("msg.txt", "w");
fwrite($fp, $data);
fclose($fp);

$headers = array("From" => "me@email.com");

openssl_pkcs7_sign("msg.txt", "signed.txt", "file://email.pem", array("file://
email.pem", "123456"), $headers);

$data = file_get_contents("signed.txt");

$parts = explode("\n\n", $data, 2);

mail("you@email.com", "Signed message.", $parts[1], $parts[0]);

echo "Email sent";

?>
===============================================================================

It is also possible to sign message including attachments. An easy way to do
this:

<?php
  $boundary = md5(uniqid(time()));
  $boddy = "MIME-Version: 1.0\n";
  $boddy .= "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"" . $boundary. "\"\n";
  $boddy .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n";
  $boddy .= "This is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n";
  $boddy .= "--$boundary\n";
  $boddy .= "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n";
  $boddy .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n";
  $boddy .= $EmailText . "\n\n";
  // Add the attachment to the message
  do  {
    $boddy .= "--$boundary\n";
    $boddy .= "Content-Type: application/pdf; name=\"FileName\"\n";
    $boddy .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n";
    $boddy .= "Content-Disposition: attachment;\n\n";
    $boddy .= chunk_split(base64_encode($file)) . "\n\n";
  } while ( {files left to be attached} );
  $boddy .= "--$boundary--\n";

  // Save message to a file
  $msg = 'msg.txt';
  $signed = 'signed.txt';
  $fp = fopen($msg, "w");
  fwrite($fp, $boddy);
  fclose($fp);

  // Sign it
  if (openssl_pkcs7_sign($msg, $signed, 'file://cert.pem',
    array('file://key.pem', 'test'),
    array("To" => "joes@example.com", // keyed syntax
         "From: HQ <ceo@example.com>", // indexed syntax
         "Subject" => "Eyes only"), PKCS7_DETACHED, 'intermediate_cert.pem' ))
{ 
    exec(ini_get('sendmail_path') . ' < ' . $signed);
  }
?>

The same can be established by using the PEAR package Mail_Mime in combination
with openssl_pkcs7_sign.
===============================================================================

It's probably worth noting that I had a great deal of difficulty getting either
Mozilla 1.4 or Outlook Express 6 to verify signatures generated by
openssl_pkcs7_sign() until I added a newline (\n) to the beginning of the
message I was signing.  Not sure why that is, but as soon as I made that change
all problems disappeared.
===============================================================================

If you want to integrate PKCS7 signing/verifying with a browser and it's not a
problem that it's only Internet Explorer (or Netscape + ActiveX plugin) you can
look at Capicom. It's a free component and available at the MSDN website.
===============================================================================

The "mycert.pem" parameters as shown in the example above are not correct.  You
either have to pass a string containing the PEM encoded certificate or key, or
the location of a file in file://path/to/file.pem notation.  See the comments
on the OpenSSL functions page (the page above this one).

If you rely on strcmp for safe string comparisons, both parameters must be
strings, the result is otherwise extremely unpredictable.
For instance you may get an unexpected 0, or return values of NULL, -2, 2, 3
and -3.

strcmp("5", 5) => 0
strcmp("15", 0xf) => 0
strcmp(61529519452809720693702583126814, 61529519452809720000000000000000) => 0
strcmp(NULL, false) => 0
strcmp(NULL, "") => 0
strcmp(NULL, 0) => -1
strcmp(false, -1) => -2
strcmp("15", NULL) => 2
strcmp(NULL, "foo") => -3
strcmp("foo", NULL) => 3
strcmp("foo", false) => 3
strcmp("foo", 0) => 1
strcmp("foo", 5) => 1
strcmp("foo", array()) => NULL + PHP Warning
strcmp("foo", new stdClass) => NULL + PHP Warning
strcmp(function(){}, "") => NULL + PHP Warning
===============================================================================

One big caveat - strings retrieved from the backtick operation may be zero
terminated (C-style), and therefore will not be equal to the non-zero
terminated strings (roughly Pascal-style) normal in PHP. The workaround is to
surround every `` pair or shell_exec() function with the trim() function. This
is likely to be an issue with other functions that invoke shells; I haven't
bothered to check.

On Debian Lenny (and RHEL 5, with minor differences), I get this:

====PHP====
<?php
$sz = `pwd`;
$ps = "/var/www";

echo "Zero-terminated string:<br />sz = ".$sz."<br />str_split(sz) = "; print_r
(str_split($sz));
echo "<br /><br />";

echo "Pascal-style string:<br />ps = ".$ps."<br />str_split(ps) = "; print_r(
str_split($ps));
echo "<br /><br />";

echo "Normal results of comparison:<br />";
echo "sz == ps = ".($sz == $ps ? "true" : "false")."<br />";
echo "strcmp(sz,ps) = ".strcmp($sz,$ps);
echo "<br /><br />";

echo "Comparison with trim()'d zero-terminated string:<br />";
echo "trim(sz) = ".trim($sz)."<br />";
echo "str_split(trim(sz)) = "; print_r(str_split(trim($sz))); echo "<br />";
echo "trim(sz) == ps = ".(trim($sz) == $ps ? "true" : "false")."<br />";
echo "strcmp(trim(sz),ps) = ".strcmp(trim($sz),$ps);
?>

====Output====
Zero-terminated string:
sz = /var/www
str_split(sz) = Array ( [0] => / [1] => v [2] => a [3] => r [4] => / [5] => w
[6] => w [7] => w [8] => )

Pascal-style string:
ps = /var/www
str_split(ps) = Array ( [0] => / [1] => v [2] => a [3] => r [4] => / [5] => w
[6] => w [7] => w )

Normal results of comparison:
sz == ps = false
strcmp(sz,ps) = 1

Comparison with trim()'d zero-terminated string:
trim(sz) = /var/www
str_split(trim(sz)) = Array ( [0] => / [1] => v [2] => a [3] => r [4] => / [5]
=> w [6] => w [7] => w )
trim(sz) == ps = true
strcmp(trim(sz),ps) = 0
===============================================================================

i hope this will give you a clear idea how strcmp works internally.

<?php
$str1 = "b";
echo ord($str1); //98
echo "<br/>";
$str2 = "t";
echo ord($str2); //116
echo "<br/>";
echo ord($str1)-ord($str2);//-18
$str1 = "bear";
$str2 = "tear";
$str3 = "";
echo "<pre>";
echo strcmp($str1, $str2); // -18
echo "<br/>";
echo strcmp($str2, $str1); //18
echo "<br/>";
echo strcmp($str2, $str2); //0
echo "<br/>";
echo strcmp($str2, $str3); //4
echo "<br/>";
echo strcmp($str3, $str2); //-4
echo "<br/>";
echo strcmp($str3, $str3); // 0
echo "</pre>";
?>
===============================================================================

Since it may not be obvious to some people, please note that there is another
possible return value for this function.

strcmp() will return NULL on failure.

This has the side effect of equating to a match when using an equals comparison
(==).
Instead, you may wish to test matches using the identical comparison (===),
which should not catch a NULL return.

---------------------
  Example
---------------------

$variable1 = array();
$ans === strcmp($variable1, $variable2);

This will stop $ans from returning a match;

Please use strcmp() carefully when comparing user input, as this may have
potential security implications in your code.
===============================================================================

Hey be sure the string you are comparing has not special characters like '\n'
or something like that.
===============================================================================

Note a difference between 5.2 and 5.3 versions

echo (int)strcmp('pending',array());
will output -1 in PHP 5.2.16 (probably in all versions prior 5.3)
but will output 0 in PHP 5.3.3

Of course, you never need to use array as a parameter in string comparisions.
===============================================================================

Reguarding the above note on language specific string comparisons, LL and RR
are also single letters in the Spanish language.
===============================================================================

Don't forget the similar_text() function...

http://php.net/manual/en/function.similar-text.php
===============================================================================

In cases when you need to compare a line from a just parsed file stream to
match a user-defined "nametag" (useful for parsing ini and configuration
files), keep in mind the 'end of line' tags as well:

// nametag to look for in a file (notice a required "\r\n" at the end)
$nametag = "[System]\r\n";

// ...assuming the file has been aready opened for reading and the stream is
bound to $filehandle... parse the file until an EOF or $nametag encountered.

while (!feof ($handle))
{
    $buffer = fgets($filehandle);
    if (strcmp($nametag, $buffer) == 0)
    {
        // at this point "[System]" is found, do additional parsings...
        break;
    }
}
===============================================================================

Just a short comment to the note of arnar at hm dot is: md5() is a hash
function and therefore it may happen (although it is very unlikely) that the
md5() checksums of  two different strings will be equal (hash collision) ...
===============================================================================

In summary, strcmp() does not necessarily use the ASCII code order of each
character like in the 'C' locale, but instead parse each string to match
language-specific character entities (such as 'ch' in Spanish, or 'dz' in
Czech), whose collation order is then compared. When both character entities
have the same collation order (such as 'ss' and ' ' in German), they are
compared relative to their code by strcmp(), or considered equal by strcasecmp
().
The LC_COLLATE locale setting is then considered: only if LC_COLLATE=C or
LC_ALL=C does strcmp() compare strings by character code.
Generally, most locales define the following order:
control, space, punctuation and underscore, digit, alpha (lower then upper with
Latin scripts; or final, middle, then isolated, initial with Arabic script),
symbols, others...
With strcasecmp(), the alpha subclass is ignored and consider all forms of
letters as equal.
Note also that some locales behave differently with accented characters: some
consider they are the same letter as the unaccented letter (with a minor
collation order, e.g. French, Italian, Spanish), some consider they are
distinct letters with an independant collation order (e.g. in the C locale, or
in Nordic languages).
Finally, the collation string is not considering individual characters but
instead groups of characters that form a single letter:
- for example "ch" or "CH" in Spanish which is always after all other strings
beginning with 'c' or 'C', including "cz", but before 'd' or 'D';
- 'ss' and ' ' in German;
- 'dz', 'DZ' and 'Dz' in some Central European languages written with the Latin
script...
- UTF-8, UTF-16 (Unicode), S-JIS, Big5, ISO2022 character encoding of a locale
(the suffix in the locale name) first decode the characters into the UCS4/
ISO10646 code position before applying the rules of the language indicated by
the main locale...
So be extremely careful to what you consider a "character", as it may just mean
a encoding byte with no significance in the string collation algorithm: the
first character of the string "cholera" in Spanish is "ch", not "c" !
===============================================================================

php dot or dot die at phpuser dot net wrote that he had an unexpected
difference in comparing between case sensitive and insensitive. They key there
is that the case insensitive comparison converts both strings to lowercase
before comparing. Since the underscore character is in a different place when
compared to an uppercase or lowercase string, the result is different.

There is no 'clear' order of punctuation and other characters in or around the
alphabet. Most code assumes ASCII order in which case there are several
characters before both upper- and lowercase, a few inbetween, and some after
both upper- and lowercase.

Note also many other/older implementations of sorting sort accented character
wrong since they appear after all other alphabetical characters in most
charactersets. There is probably a function in PHP to take this into account
though.

Therefore I would not recommend to make a detailed assumption on how
punctuation and other characters sort in relation to alphabetical characters.
If sorting these characters at a specific place and in a specific order is
important for you, you should probably write a custom string comparison
function that does it the way you want. Usually it's sufficient to have a
consistent sorting order though, which is what you get by using either strcmp,
or strcasecmp consistently.
===============================================================================

strcmp returns -1 ou 1 if two strings are not identical,
and 0 when they are, except when comparing a string and an empty string (<?php
$a = "";  ?>), it returns the length of the string.

For instance:
<?php
        $a = "foo"; // length 3
        $b = ""; // empty string
        $c = "barbar"; // length 6

        echo strcmp($a, $a); // outputs 0
        echo strcmp($a, $c); // outputs 1
        echo strcmp($c, $a); // outputs -1
        echo strcmp($a, $b); // outputs 3
        echo strcmp($b, $a); // outputs -3
        echo strcmp($c, $b); // outputs 6
        echo strcmp($b, $c); // outputs -6
?>
===============================================================================

Sometimes when you compare two strings that look "the same", you will find that
they aren't. If you don't want to bother finding out why, then this is a simple
solution:

$string = implode(str_split($string));

Converting the strings to md5 is also a nice method to see if they're equal.

md5($str1)."\n";
md5($str2)."\n\n";

For those that are confused about the way this function works:

<?php
$str1 = 'a';
$str2 = 'b';
var_dump(strcmp($str1, $str2)); //int(-1)
?>

Alphabetically 'a' precedes 'b'. If we view the strings as values 'a' is less
than 'b' and therefore the function returns -1.

If we were searching through an alphabetically sorted list we'd have a
numerical index ($i) and compare the search string ($sstr) against each member
of the string list ($slist), using strcmp we can check whether to go "up"($i++)
or "down"($i--) through this list.

Here's the example function:
<?php
function strInList ($sstr)
{
    $slist = array('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' /* etc */);
   
    $i = sizeof($slist) / 2; //start the index in the middle
   
    while ($i < sizeof($slist) && $i >= 0) { //constrain $i to the scope of
$slist
       
        $cmp = strcmp($slist[$i], $sstr);
       
        if ($cmp > 0) { //alphabetically, $slist[$i] procedes $sstr
            $i--; //move DOWN the list
        } else if ($cmp < 0) { //alphabetically, $slist[$i] precedes $sstr
            $i++; //move UP the list
        } else if ($cmp == 0) { //$slist[$i] occurs neither before nor after
$sstr
            return true; //successful match
        }
    }
    return false; //The index fell out of the list scope, with no match made
}
?>

Some notes about the spanish locale. I've read some notes that says  "CH", "RR"
or "LL" must be considered as a single letter in Spanish. That's not really
tru. "CH", "RR" and "LL" where considered a single letter in the past (lot of
years ago), for that you must use the "Tradictional Sort". Nowadays, the
Academy uses the Modern Sort and recomends not to consider anymore "CH", "RR"
and "LL" as a single letter. They must be considered two separated letters and
sort and compare on that way.

Ju just have to take a look to the Offial Spanish Language Dictionary and you
can see there that from many years ago there is not the separated section for
"CH", "LL" or "RR" ... i.e. words starting with CH must be after the ones
starting by CG, and before the ones starting by CI.
===============================================================================

I have tried the  strcmp function. Pls be very carefull. The string comparison
must exactly "equal". So many people had confused.

I.e

My program read a string from test.txt file to get the
"[company name]" string.

// get contents of a file into a string
$filename = "test.txt";
$fd = fopen ($filename, "rb");
$contents = fread ($fd, filesize ($filename));

for($i=0;$i<strpos($contents, "]")+1;$i++)
{
//print $contents[$i];
//$a=trim($contents[$i]);
$a=$contents[$i];
echo $a;
//echo $i;
}

$str2="[companyname]";

// this comparison will resulted on greater (1), $result=1
//please remember $tempvariable[2] != $tempvariable (is not equal)
$result = strcmp(strtolower($a),strtolower($str2));

//this comparison working properly, $result=0
//$result = strcmp(strtolower($a),strtolower($str2[12]));

echo $result;

if ($a==$str2[12]) //double check the equality of string
{
echo "read the NextLine"; }
else {
echo "not equal";
}
//end

fclose ($fd);
?>

I hope the above example will help you.
===============================================================================

The definition of return values of this function is listed correctly on this
page, however, there is a common misconception in the notes posted here
previously from users.

A previous poster said:
If $str1 == $str2 strcmp return 0.
If $str1  > $str2 strcmp return 1.
If $str1  < $str2 strcmp return -1.

That is incorrect, please look at the definition of the function
at the top of this page. It returns less than 0 if str1 is less than str2. Note
the phrase "less than", it does not return just -1, but any negative value. The
same happens when str1 is greater than str2, but it returns a positive,
non-zero value. It returns a positive value that can be 1, or any number
thereafter.

strcmp() returns a number that is the difference between the two strings
starting with the last character that was found to be similar.

Here is an example:

$output = strcmp("red", "blue");

The variable $output with contain a value of 16
===============================================================================

If you want to strings according to locale, use strcoll instead.
===============================================================================

When using strcmp to compare results received from a form, keep in mind that
the way you decide to encapsulate the value of the form will have an effect on
your strcmp() results.

Example:

<input type="post" name="user[0]" value="abc">
<input type="post" name="user[1]" value='abc'>

strcmp() will not return the values sent from this form as "0".

However, by using single-quotes or double-quotes to encapsulate BOTH values,
strcmp() will return a "0" result.
===============================================================================

Regarding bizarre return values from str*cmp(), I was having similar troubles
until I realized that I was attempting to compare a string with HTML formatting
with its plain-text equivilant. The formatted string was an <OPTION> value, so
the HTML was rendered without the <b> and <i> formatting I was using.
Consequently the formatted and unformatted strings were rendered identically in
the browser. D'oh!
===============================================================================

It's definitely worth noting that the return-values of strcmp() when used for
i.e. password-checking is the oposite of that of the ==-operator.

I.e.:
$pw1 = "yeah";
$pw2 = "yeah";

if (strcmp($pw1, $pw2)) {   // This returns false.
    // $pw1 and $pw2 are NOT the same.
} else {
    // $pw1 and $pw2 are the same.
}

Where the use of the == operator would give us.:
if ($pw1==$pw2) {    // This returns true.
    // $pw1 and $pw2 are the same.
} else {
    // $pw1 and $pw2 are NOT the same.
}

Additionally, to check if $pw1 and $pw2 are of the same type you can use the ==
= operator.
===============================================================================

Here is my function to compare russian words.
You can replace $abc to your alphabet.

function strcmp_rus($str1, $str2)
{
    $abc = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯ
абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя";
    $len = min(strlen($str1), strlen($str2));
    for ($i = 0; $i < $len; $i++)
    {
        $s1 = strlen($abc);
        $s2 = strlen($abc);
        for ($j = 0; $j < strlen($abc); $j++) if ($str1[$i] == $abc[$j]) $s1 =
$j;
        for ($k = 0; $k < strlen($abc); $k++) if ($str2[$i] == $abc[$k]) $s2 =
$k;
        if ($s1 < $s2) return -1;
        else if ($s1 > $s2) return 1;   
    }
    return 0;
}

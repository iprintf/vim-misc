PDO::quote

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7, PECL pdo >= 0.2.1)

PDO::quote — Quotes a string for use in a query.

说明

public string PDO::quote ( string $string [, int $parameter_type =
PDO::PARAM_STR ] )

PDO::quote() places quotes around the input string (if required) and escapes
special characters within the input string, using a quoting style appropriate
to the underlying driver.

If you are using this function to build SQL statements, you are strongly
recommended to use PDO::prepare() to prepare SQL statements with bound
parameters instead of using PDO::quote() to interpolate user input into an SQL
statement. Prepared statements with bound parameters are not only more
portable, more convenient, immune to SQL injection, but are often much faster
to execute than interpolated queries, as both the server and client side can
cache a compiled form of the query.

Not all PDO drivers implement this method (notably PDO_ODBC). Consider using
prepared statements instead.

Caution

Security: the default character set

The character set must be set either on the server level, or within the
database connection itself (depending on the driver) for it to affect 
PDO::quote(). See the driver-specific documentation for more information.

参数

string

    The string to be quoted.

parameter_type

    Provides a data type hint for drivers that have alternate quoting styles.

返回值

Returns a quoted string that is theoretically safe to pass into an SQL
statement. Returns FALSE if the driver does not support quoting in this way.

范例

Example #1 Quoting a normal string

<?php
$conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');

/* Simple string */
$string = 'Nice';
print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
print "Quoted string: " . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

以上例程会输出：

Unquoted string: Nice
Quoted string: 'Nice'

Example #2 Quoting a dangerous string

<?php
$conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');

/* Dangerous string */
$string = 'Naughty \' string';
print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
print "Quoted string:" . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

以上例程会输出：

Unquoted string: Naughty ' string
Quoted string: 'Naughty '' string'

Example #3 Quoting a complex string

<?php
$conn = new PDO('sqlite:/home/lynn/music.sql3');

/* Complex string */
$string = "Co'mpl''ex \"st'\"ring";
print "Unquoted string: $string\n";
print "Quoted string: " . $conn->quote($string) . "\n";
?>

以上例程会输出：

Unquoted string: Co'mpl''ex "st'"ring
Quoted string: 'Co''mpl''''ex "st''"ring'

===============================================================================

When converting from the old mysql_ functions to PDO, note that the quote
function isn't exactly the same as the old mysql_real_escape_string function.
It escapes, but also adds quotes; hence the name I guess :-)

After I replaced mysql_real_escape_string with $pdo->quote, it took me a bit to
figure out why my strings were turning up in results with quotes around them. I
felt like a fool when I realized all I needed to do was change ...\"".$pdo->
quote($foo)."\"... to ...".$pdo->quote($foo)."...
===============================================================================

This function also converts new lines to \r\n
===============================================================================

One have to understand that string formatting has nothing to do with
identifiers.
And thus string formatting should NEVER ever be used to format an identifier (
table of field name).
To quote an identifier, you have to format it as identifier, not as string.
To do so you have to

- Enclose identifier in backticks.
- Escape backticks inside by doubling them.

So, the code would be:
<?php
function quoteIdent($field) {
    return "`".str_replace("`","``",$field)."`";
}
?>
this will make your identifier properly formatted and thus invulnerable to
injection.

However, there is another possible attack vector - using dynamical identifiers
in the query may give an outsider control over fields the aren't allowed to:
Say, a field user_role in the users table and a dynamically built INSERT query
based on a $_POST array may allow a privilege escalation with easily forged
$_POST array.
Or a select query which let a user to choose fields to display may reveal some
sensitive information to attacker.

To prevent this kind of attack yet keep queries dynamic, one ought to use
WHITELISTING approach.

Every dynamical identifier have to be checked against a hardcoded whitelist
like this:
<?php
$allowed  = array("name","price","qty");
$key = array_search($_GET['field'], $allowed));
if ($key == false) {
    throw new Exception('Wrong field name');
}
$field = $db->quoteIdent($allowed[$key]);
$query = "SELECT $field FROM t"; //value is safe
?>
(Personally I wouldn't use a query like this, but that's just an example of
using a dynamical identifier in the query).

And similar approach have to be used when filtering dynamical arrays for insert
and update:

<?php
function filterArray($input,$allowed)
{
    foreach(array_keys($input) as $key )
    {
        if ( !in_array($key,$allowed) )
        {
             unset($input[$key]);
        }
    }
    return $input;
}
//used like this
$allowed = array('title','url','body','rating','term','type');
$data = $db->filterArray($_POST,$allowed);
// $data now contains allowed fields only
// and can be used to create INSERT or UPDATE query dynamically
?>
===============================================================================

Note that this function just does what the documentation says: It escapes
special characters in strings.

It does NOT - however - detect a "NULL" value. If the value you try to quote is
"NULL" it will return the same value as when you process an empty string (->
''), not the text "NULL".
===============================================================================

In foundation quoting is bad idea,there always will be possibillity to escape
or fraud quote function ,better solution,i mean best solution is using this
function : htmlentities($string, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') which translate quote
into &#39; and $string translated like this can't affect on your code.

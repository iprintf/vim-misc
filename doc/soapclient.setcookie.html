===============================================================================

You can access the cookies sent by SOAP server using $client->_cookies

Most you need to send session cookies back to server.
===============================================================================

On the server side you can access the cookie via $_COOKIE['cookie_name'].

Also remember that since HTTP is a stateless protocol, you have to send the
cookie with every single SOAP call in order for it to be visible at server
site.

It seems obvious but might save one a lot of time.

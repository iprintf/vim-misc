(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoCollection::aggregateCursor — Execute an aggregation pipeline command and
retrieve results through a cursor

说明

public MongoCommandCursor MongoCollection::aggregateCursor ( array $command [, 
array $options ] )

With this method you can execute Aggregation Framework pipelines and retrieve
the results through a cursor, instead of getting just one document back as you
would with MongoCollection::aggregate(). This method returns a
MongoCommandCursor object. This cursor object implements the Iterator interface
just like the MongoCursor objects that are returned by the 
MongoCollection::find() method.

    Note: The resulting MongoCommandCursor will inherit this collection's read
    preference. MongoCommandCursor::setReadPreference() may be used to change
    the read preference before iterating on the cursor.

参数

pipeline

    The Aggregation Framework pipeline to execute.

options

    Options for the aggregation command. Valid options include:

      □ "allowDiskUse"

        Allow aggregation stages to write to temporary files

      □ "cursor"

        It is possible to configure how many initial documents the server
        should return with the first result set. The default initial batch size
        is 101. You can change it by adding the batchSize option:

        <?php
        $collection->aggregateCursor( 
            $pipeline,
            [ "cursor" => [ "batchSize" => 4 ] ]
        );

        This option only configures the size of the first batch. To configure
        the size of future batches, please use the 
        MongoCommandCursor::batchSize() method on the returned
        MongoCommandCursor object.

      □ "explain"

        Return information on the processing of the pipeline. This option may
        cause the command to return a result document that is unsuitable for
        constructing a MongoCommandCursor. If you need to use this option, you
        should consider using MongoCollection::aggregate().

      □ "maxTimeMS"

        Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing the
        operation on the server (does not include idle time). If the operation
        is not completed by the server within the timeout period, a
        MongoExecutionTimeoutException will be thrown.

返回值

Returns a MongoCommandCursor object. Because this implements the Iterator
interface you can iterate over each of the results as returned by the command
query. The MongoCommandCursor also implements the MongoCursorInterface
interface which adds the MongoCommandCursor::batchSize(), 
MongoCommandCursor::dead(), MongoCommandCursor::info() methods.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::aggregateCursor() example

Finding all of the distinct values for a key.

<?php
$m = new MongoClient;
$db = $m->test;
$people = $db->people;
$people->drop();

$people->insert(array("name" => "Joe", "points" => 4));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Molly", "points" => 43));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Sally", "points" => 22));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Joe", "points" => 22));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Molly", "points" => 87));

$ages = $people->aggregateCursor( [
        [ '$group' => [ '_id' => '$name', 'points' => [ '$sum' => '$points' ] ]
 ],
        [ '$sort' => [ 'points' => -1 ] ],
] );

foreach ($ages as $person) {
    echo "{$person['_id']}: {$person['points']}\n";
}

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：


Molly: 130
Joe: 26
Sally: 22

Example #2 MongoCollection::aggregateCursor() example with different initial
batch size

Finding all of the distinct values for a key.

<?php
$m = new MongoClient;
$db = $m->test;
$people = $db->people;
$people->drop();

/* Insert some sample data */
$people->insert(array("name" => "Joe", "points" => 4));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Molly", "points" => 43));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Sally", "points" => 22));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Joe", "points" => 22));
$people->insert(array("name" => "Molly", "points" => 87));

/* Run the command cursor */
$ages = $people->aggregateCursor(
    [
        [ '$group' => [ '_id' => '$name', 'points' => [ '$sum' => '$points' ] ]
 ],
        [ '$sort' => [ 'points' => -1 ] ],
    ],
    [ "cursor" => [ "batchSize" => 4 ] ]
);

foreach ($ages as $person) {
    echo "{$person['_id']}: {$person['points']}\n";
}

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：


Molly: 130
Joe: 26
Sally: 22

===============================================================================

It looks like maxTimeMS option in the latest release (1.5.8) is not valid
anymore. Set \MongoCursor::$timeout before you call aggregateCursor()

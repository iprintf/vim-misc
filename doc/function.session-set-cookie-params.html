session_set_cookie_params

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_set_cookie_params — 设置会话 cookie 参数

说明

void session_set_cookie_params ( int $lifetime [, string $path [, string
$domain [, bool $secure = false [, bool $httponly = false ]]]] )

Cookie 参数可以在 php.ini 文件中定义，本函数仅在当前脚本执行过程中有效。因此，
如果要通过函数修改 cookie 参数，需要对每个请求都要在调用 session_start() 函数之
前调用 session_set_cookie_params() 函数。

本函数会修改运行期 ini 设置值，可以通过 ini_get() 函数获取这些值。

参数

lifetime

    Cookie 的生命周期，以秒为单位。

path

    此 cookie 的有效路径。 on the domain where 设置为“/”表示对于本域上所有的路
    径此 cookie 都可用。

domain

    Cookie 的作用域。例如：“www.php.net”。如果要让 cookie 在所有的子域中都可用
    ，此参数必须以点（.）开头，例如：“.php.net”。

secure

    设置为 TRUE 表示 cookie 仅在使用安全链接时可用。

httponly

    设置为 TRUE 表示 PHP 发送 cookie 的时候会使用 httponly 标记。

返回值

没有返回值。

更新日志

版本          说明
5.2.0 加入 httponly 参数。

As PHP's Session Control does not handle session lifetimes correctly when using
session_set_cookie_params(), we need to do something in order to change the
session expiry time every time the user visits our site. So, here's the
problem.

<?php
  $lifetime=600;
  session_set_cookie_params($lifetime);
  session_start();
?>

This code doesn't change the lifetime of the session when the user gets back at
our site or refreshes the page. The session WILL expire after $lifetime
seconds, no matter how many times the user requests the page. So we just
overwrite the session cookie as follows:

<?php
  $lifetime=600;
  session_start();
  setcookie(session_name(),session_id(),time()+$lifetime);
?>

And now we have the same session cookie with the lifetime set to the proper
value.

Firefox 2.0 also supports them, but only since version 2.0.0.5.

===============================================================================

Setting the domain for cookies in session_set_cookie_params() only affects the
domain used for the session cookie which is set by PHP.

All other cookies set by calling the function setcookie() either:
i) Use the domain set explicitly in the call to setcookie()
or
ii) Don't set the domain at all on the cookie and so the browser assumes it's
for the current domain.

So to make all your cookies be available across all sub-domains of your site
you need to do this:

<?php
$currentCookieParams = session_get_cookie_params();

$rootDomain = '.example.com';

session_set_cookie_params(
    $currentCookieParams["lifetime"],
    $currentCookieParams["path"],
    $rootDomain,
    $currentCookieParams["secure"],
    $currentCookieParams["httponly"]
);

session_name('mysessionname');
session_start();

setcookie($cookieName, $cookieValue, time() + 3600, '/', $rootDomain);
?>
===============================================================================

Please take note of the garbage collection "feature" on systems like Ubuntu and
Debian.

apt-get installs a cron script at /etc/cron.d/php5 that checks the
session.gc_maxlifetime variable and then deletes all old sessions every 9 and
39 minutes.

The problem is: If you set the maxlifetime for a specific virtual host, those
settings will be ignored. Lets say you want your server to store sessions for
only 30 minutes, but for one special website you want all sessions to be 24
hours. If you set the session.gc_maxlifetime in .htaccess, your apache conf or
use ini_set in your code, it won't work and sessions will still be destroyed
after 30 minutes. That's because /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime (found in that cron
file) will always return the value in your php.ini, not the values you set in
.htaccess.

A workaround is to set the maxlifetime to the maximum your sites require, and
then configure a shorter maxlifetime in your .htaccess for those sites that
don't need it.

Another solution is to give the php5 file in /etc/cron.d sane values, ie, only
let it run at 3am in the morning, but you'll have to remember to block the
replacement of this file it every time you update php.
===============================================================================

REMEMBER, that if you have a multi-subdomain site, you must put the following
to enable a session id on the whole website:

<?php
session_set_cookie_params(0, '/', '.example.com');
session_start();
?>

Otherwise, you'll have 2 diffrent sessions on e.g. news.example.com and
download.example.com
===============================================================================

The information above about this function that it can only be used BEFORE
session_start depends on how you use it. Because its also useful AFTER a
session has started as follows:

Example you wand to change an already set value of the session cookie expire
time:

<?php

// Here we start as usual
session_set_cookie_params('3600'); // 1 hour
session_start();

// More code...

// Now we found in some database that the user whishes
// the cookie to expire after for example 10 minutes
// we can change it instantly !

session_set_cookie_params('600'); // 10 minutes.
session_regenerate_id(true);

// This will delete old cookie and adopt new expire settings and the
// old cookie variables in a new cookie

?>

Please note i only explained the browser (client) side changes of session
cookie's expire time.
===============================================================================

when setting the path that the cookie is valid for, always remember to have
that trailing '/'.

CORRECT:
session_set_cookie_params (0, '/yourpath/');

INCORRECT:
session_set_cookie_params (0, '/yourpath');

no comment on how long it took me to realize that this was the cause of my
authentication/session problems...
===============================================================================

Something that has taken me some time to debug: session_set_cookie_params()
does not work when the domain param is just a one level domain, like it was a
TLD.

I have a site in an intranet and our internal domain is .local, so trying to
set the cookie session to the .local domain does not work:

session_set_cookie_params(0, '/', '.local'); // Does not work

In all test I've done, setting the domain only works for SLDs and above:

session_set_cookie_params(0 , '/', '.sld.local'); Does work

This is nothing to do with PHP but the http protocol, witch does not permit
setting cookies for TLDs for obvious security reasons.
===============================================================================

The below note is an excellent example of how to 'reset' the session expiration
time upon a page refresh.

However, take care to compensate for when the session expires and doesn't renew
itself (a bug I believe). If the below example is run every time a script is
executed, it will give an 'Undefined index <session name> error' after the
session fails to renew. Precede it with and if isset() condition.

<?php
private function startSession($time = 3600, $ses = 'MYSES') {
    session_set_cookie_params($time);
    session_name($ses);
    session_start();

    // Reset the expiration time upon page load
    if (isset($_COOKIE[$ses]))
      setcookie($ses, $_COOKIE[$ses], time() + $time, "/");
}
?>

The above example states that a session will last an hour without a page
refresh until it is scrapped. Upon a page refresh, the expiration time is reset
back to one hour again. If you wish to give users the option of 'staying logged
in forever', just feed startSession a value of '99999999', which should last
about 3 years.
===============================================================================

One might want to be noted that the browsers are case-sensitive to the $path
parameter.

For example, if you do this:
<?php
session_set_cookie_params(0,"/webapp/");
session_start();
?>

and you visit your site in this way:
example.com/WebApp/

You would get a new session on every request.

I'm not sure if this is the standard, but I see this happens on IE 6, Firefox
12 (Palemoon, actually), Chrome 19 (Portable version), and on both IIS and
Apache.
===============================================================================

Further to "info at xyzsite dot ru" and William Leslie, Safari on OS X also
doesn't honour cookies with an underscore in the subdomain.

The workaround I've found is to specify the parent domain as the cookie domain
-- instead of "bad_name.example.com", set the path to ".example.com"; it's
suboptimal, but gets the job done.
===============================================================================

i found it somewhat difficult to work with sessions due to the documentation
not really denoting the necessity for the session name to be set via
session_name() in order for session_set_cookie_params() to be of any use.  i
found no reference to session_name() in this article, and my session functions
would have been a disastrous mess were it not for a friend familiar with
session.

so, in essence, for anybody wondering about where to start: declare a session
name before using session_set_cookie_params(), otherwise you might agitate php
to the point of committing some atrocity against your webserver.
===============================================================================

For anyone looking for which browsers support the HTTPOnly flag, per my
research:

IE 6 SP 1 and higher.
Firefox 3 and higher.
Opera 9.50 and higher.

As of Safari 3.1.1 (April 2008), Safari did not yet support this flag.

This cookie flag was developed by Microsoft and is slowly making its way into
other browsers: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533046.aspx
===============================================================================

"Info at xyzsite dot ru" writes that Internet Explorer does not correctly
handle cookies whose domain contains an underscore character.

However, There's a good reason for this apparently faulty behavior: the
underscore character is forbidden in DNS names.  RFC 3696 says:

"The labels ... that make up a domain name must consist of only the ASCII
alphabetic and numeric characters, plus the hyphen.  No other symbols or
punctuation characters are permitted, nor is blank space."

If the underscore works in Mozilla or other browsers, it's only because they
are being lenient in the validation of domain names.
===============================================================================

The first argument to session_set_cookie_params is the number of seconds in the
future (based on the server's current time) that the session will expire.  So
if you want your sessions to last 100 days:

$expireTime = 60*60*24*100; // 100 days
session_set_cookie_params($expireTime);

I was using time()+$expireTime, which is WRONG (a lot of the
session_set_cookie_params() examples I found get this wrong, but probably don't
care because they are just doing "infinite" sessions).
===============================================================================

Cross-domain Cookies do work in all browsers (path '/' server '.example.com'),
except the case you try it in IE6/7 and the server name is retreived from :etc/
hosts: file, in that case the cookie won't be even saved.
===============================================================================

[Editor's Note:

Rasmus' Solution from the PHP-General list:

Just use a session cookie (by not providing an expiry time) and add the
server's expiry timestamp to the value of the cookie.  Then when you get
that cookie sent to you, check it against your server's time and make the
decision on whether to accept the cookie or not based on that.

That way you are immune from people not having their system clocks set
right.

A couple things I noticed when using this. I think it only works if you set the
session_set_cookie_params() function BEFORE the session_start() function.

Also, when you set the "lifetime" on the cookie, it takes the seconds offset
from the SERVER. it sends the cookie encoded to timeout at the SERVER time. So
if your server is +2 minutes ahead of the client, and you set the cookie to
timeout after 30 seconds, the client actually has 2 minutes and 30 seconds
before the cookie times out. I don't know if there's any way that this can be
patched in future versions, and the only alternative I think is setting cookies
in javascript, which is hardly the point when using all these specific session
functions.
===============================================================================

It appears that if you are setting a session cookie on https://
subdomain123.example.com for .example.com that the default of the secure cookie
is not false but true.

So your cookie won't work on http://subdomainxyz.example.com unless you set the
secure option to false.
===============================================================================

Just one more bad situation - cookies in Internet Explorer do not work with '_'
in domain name. FF and Opera are O.K. So if your hostname is like
test_host.example.com, IE cookies will not function correctly/

Well the SHA-2 digest returned by this function IS different from what you get
when you hash the file, because this funtions hashesh the pixels themselves.

This is very useful when you need to identify identical images, because if you
just hash the files, you may get different hashes even if the image is the same
pixel by pixel because of differences in metadata or different format (ie PNG
vs BMP) or perhaps stray bytes at the end of file etc...

There is no point in posting code that hashes files, that is completely
irrelevant here.

Also, I doubt you really need to pick a different hashing algo, SHA-2 should be
perfectly fine for this job.

Please take that note tha different versions of ImageMagick could create
different signatures, even when working with the same image.

The getImageSignature function for the ImageMagick package in PHP returns only
the SHA-1 hash value for an image.  There are not any other algorithms
available for it within the ImageMagick package, but fortunately, this is PHP
and you have a wide array of hashing algorithms to use on any image file.  The
function hash_algos() will return an array of hashing algorithms available in
PHP and the function hash_file() will take three parameters (one for the
algorithm to use, one for the filename, and an optional variable for binary
output).  Instead of being limited to the SHA-1 algorithm of the
getImageSignature function, you could use SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Whirlpool,
HAVAL, Salsa, Gost, Adler32, CRC32, or MD5, among others and variations of
these.

However, the SHA-1 result of the hash_file() function performed on a file does
not return the same result as the SHA-1 of the getImageSignature() function. 
This leads me to believe that the SHA-1 of the getImageSignature() might be
performed on the Imagick object itself, instead of the file, whereas the
hash_file() function is clearly performed on the file itself.  That's just a
guess, though.

Some sample code for the alternate hashing algorithm, with every algorithm
performed on the image file :

<?php

            // Author: holdoffhunger@gmail.com

        // Set File for Hashing Function
        // ---------------------------------------------------

    $filename_with_folder_for_hashing = "image_workshop/test_file.bmp";
   
        // Acquire Dynamic Hashing Algorithm List
        // ---------------------------------------------------

    $php_dynamic_hash_algorithms = hash_algos();

        // Count Dynamic Hashing Algorithm List
        // ---------------------------------------------------
   
    $number_of_dynamic_hash_algorithms = count($php_dynamic_hash_algorithms);

        // Parse Dynamic Hashing Algorithm List
        // ---------------------------------------------------
   
    for($i = 0; $i < $number_of_dynamic_hash_algorithms; $i++)
    {
            // Get Current Hashing Algorithm
            // ---------------------------------------------------

        $current_hashing_algorithm = $php_dynamic_hash_algorithms[$i];

            // Perform Hashing on File
            // ---------------------------------------------------

        $current_hashing_algorithm_hex_result = hash_file(
$current_hashing_algorithm, $filename_with_folder_for_hashing, FALSE);

            // Print Hashed Results
            // ---------------------------------------------------

        print("$current_hashing_algorithm Algorithm ::: 
$current_hashing_algorithm_hex_result");
        print("<br><br>");
    }

?>

The getImageSignature function returns the SHA-256 hash value, which is 256
bits (or 32 bytes) in length.  SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 set of
cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA, which also includes SHA-224,
SHA-384, and SHA-512.  According to Wikipedia, there are some security flaws in
it similar to the set of SHA-1 hash functions, which should be fixed with
SHA-3, eventually.  Unlike MD5 or the SHA-1 set of cryptographic functions,
SHA-2 has had no collisions discovered yet (a collision is an incident where
two different pieces of data result in the same hash value from the hashing
function).  For the time being, it seems to be the most efficient method for
creating a small (32-byte), uniquely-identifiable, generally-secure value for
either a file or a piece of data.

Some sample code :

<?php

            // Author: holdoffhunger@gmail.com
   
        // Imagick Type
        // ---------------------------------------------

    $imagick_type = new Imagick();
   
        // Open File
        // ---------------------------------------------
       
    $file_to_grab = "image_workshop_directory/test.bmp";
   
    $file_handle_for_viewing_image_file = fopen($file_to_grab, 'a+');
   
        // Grab File
        // ---------------------------------------------

    $imagick_type->readImageFile($file_handle_for_viewing_image_file);
   
        // Get Image SHA-256 Signature / Hash Value
        // ---------------------------------------------
       
    $imagick_type_signature = $imagick_type->getImageSignature();
   
        // Print Image Signature / Hash Value
        // ---------------------------------------------
       
    print($imagick_type_signature);

?>

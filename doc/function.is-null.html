is_null — 检测变量是否为 NULL

描述

bool is_null ( mixed $var )

如果 var 是 null 则返回 TRUE，否则返回 FALSE。

查看 NULL 类型获知变量什么时候被认为是 NULL，而什么时候不是。

参见 NULL、is_bool()、is_numeric()、is_float()、is_int()、is_string()、
is_object()、is_array()、is_integer() 和 is_real()。

Micro optimization isn't worth it.

You had to do it ten million times to notice a difference, a little more than 2
seconds

$a===NULL; Took: 1.2424390316s
is_null($a); Took: 3.70693397522s

difference = 2.46449494362
difference/10,000,000 = 0.000000246449494362

The execution time difference between ===NULL and is_null is less than 250
nanoseconds. Go optimize something that matters.

See how php parses different values. $var is the variable.

$var        =    NULL    ""    0    "0"    1

strlen($var)    =    0    0    1    1    1
is_null($var)    =    TRUE    FALSE    FALSE    FALSE    FALSE
$var == ""    =    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE    FALSE
!$var        =    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE
!is_null($var)    =    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE    TRUE
$var != ""    =    FALSE    FALSE    FALSE    TRUE    TRUE
$var        =    FALSE    FALSE    FALSE    FALSE    TRUE

Peace!

$var===NULL is much faster than is_null($var) (with the same result)

I did some benchmarking with 10 million iterations:

$a=null;
isset($a); Took: 1.71841216087s
$a==NULL; Took: 1.27205181122s
$a===NULL; Took: 1.2424390316s
is_null($a); Took: 3.70693397522s
$a=5;
isset($a); Took: 1.15165400505s
$a==NULL; Took: 1.41901302338s
$a===NULL; Took: 1.21655392647s
is_null($a); Took: 3.78501200676s
error_reporting(E_ALL&~E_NOTICE);
unset($a);
isset($a); Took: 1.51441502571s
$a==NULL; Took: 16.5414860249s
$a===NULL; Took: 16.1273870468s
is_null($a); Took: 23.1918480396s

Please note, that isset is only included because it gives a good performance in
any case; HOWEVER isset is NOT the same, or the opposite.
But you might be able to use isset() instead of null-checking.

You should not use is_null, except when you need a callback-function, or for
conformity with is_int, is_float, etc.
===============================================================================

Using === NULL instead of is_null(), is actually useful in loaded server
scenarios where you have hundreds or thousands of requests per second. Saving
microseconds on a lot of "simple" operations in the entire PHP execution chain
usually results in being able to serve more pages per second at the same speed,
or lowering your cpu usage. People usually write very bad and slow code.
===============================================================================

For what I realized is that  is_null($var)  returns exactly the opposite of 
isset($var) , except that is_null($var) throws a notice if $var hasn't been set
yet.

the following will prove that:

<?php

$quirks = array(null, true, false, 0, 1, '', "\0", "unset");

foreach($quirks as $var) {
    if ($var === "unset") unset($var);

    echo is_null($var) ? 1 : 0;
    echo isset($var) ? 1 : 0;
    echo "\n";
}

?>

this will print out something like:

10    // null
01    // true
01    // false
01    // 0
01    // 1
01    // ''
01    // "\0"
Notice:  Undefined variable: var in /srv/www/htdocs/sandbox/null/nulltest.php
on line 8
10    // (unset)

For the major quirky types/values is_null($var) obviously always returns the
opposite of isset($var), and the notice clearly points out the faulty line with
the is_null() statement. You might want to examine the return value of those
functions in detail, but since both are specified to return boolean types there
should be no doubt.

A second look into the PHP specs tells that is_null() checks whether a value is
null or not. So, you may pass any VALUE to it, eg. the result of a function.
isset() on the other hand is supposed to check for a VARIABLE's existence,
which makes it a language construct rather than a function. Its sole porpuse
lies in that checking. Passing anything else will result in an error.

Knowing that, allows us to draw the following unlikely conclusion:

isset() as a language construct is way faster, more reliable and powerful than
is_null() and should be prefered over is_null(), except for when you're
directly passing a function's result, which is considered bad programming
practice anyways.
===============================================================================

In PHP 7 (phpng), is_null is actually marginally faster than ===, although the
performance difference between the two is far smaller.

PHP 5.5.9
is_null - float(2.2381200790405)
===     - float(1.0024659633636)
=== faster by ~100ns per call

PHP 7.0.0-dev (built: May 19 2015 10:16:06)
is_null - float(1.4121870994568)
===     - float(1.4577329158783)
is_null faster by ~5ns per call
===============================================================================

Actually, since a wrapper is going to be written, you can check for your own
version null values...if you want to be creative for some reason.

<?php
function isnull($data)
{
  /** only if you need this
  if (is_string($data)) {
    $data = strtolower($data);
  }
  */
  switch ($data) {
    // Add whatever your definition of null is
    // This is just an example
    //-----------------------------
    case 'unknown': // continue
    case 'undefined': // continue
    //-----------------------------
    case 'null': // continue
    case 'NULL': // continue
    case NULL:
      return true;
  }
  // return false by default
  return false;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Regarding avoidance of NULLs in your MySQL queries, why not use  IS NULL and IS
NOT NULL in your WHERE clauses.

SELECT *
FROM someDatabase
WHERE someAttribute IS NOT NULL

Don't try to test
if ($intSomething==NULL) {
...
}
use is_null() instead.
The first statement misses 0 values.

[Ed. note: this is because == tests for equivalence of value, but not type.
NULL evaluates to
false, as does 0, so NULL == 0 is true--even though 0 is type int and NULL is
type null.
You should use either is_null() as noted or ===, which returns true only if its
operands are
equal and of the same type.]

event_timer_set — Prepare a timer event

说明

bool event_timer_set ( resource $event , callable $callback [, mixed $arg ] )

Prepares the timer event to be used in event_add(). The event is prepared to
call the function specified by the callback when the event timeout elapses.

After initializing the event, use event_base_set() to associate the event with
its event base.

In case of matching event, these three arguments are passed to the callback
function:

fd

    Signal number or resource indicating the stream.

events

    A flag indicating the event. This will always be EV_TIMEOUT for timer
    events.

arg

    Optional parameter, previously passed to event_timer_set() as arg.

参数

event

    Valid event resource.

callback

    Callback function to be called when the matching event occurs.

arg

    Optional callback parameter.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

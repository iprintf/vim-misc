Ok, this page is driving me crazy. Parsing the lines returned in the array is
simple enough but there is no definitions on what the flags mean. So I searched
the web to find the answer and this is what I was able to gather:

A - Answered: email has been replied to
N - New: Recent and not seen
R - Recent: Recent and seen
U - Unread: The message has not been read yet
F - Flagged: Message is "flagged" for urgent/special attention
D - Deleted: Message is "deleted" for removal by later EXPUNGE
X - Draft: Message has not completed composition (marked as a draft).

please correct me if I am wrong...

Message flag descriptions can be found on official imap_headerinfo page (http:/
/www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-headerinfo.php) in "Return Value"
paragraph.

This function will not return a full subject line if it is longer than 25
characters.  I found this out after trying to search each header and move the
email to a different folder depending on what the subject was (searching for
year and project number).

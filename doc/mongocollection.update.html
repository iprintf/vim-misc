(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

MongoCollection::update — Update records based on a given criteria

说明

public bool|array MongoCollection::update ( array $criteria , array $new_object
[, array $options = array() ] )

参数

criteria

    Query criteria for the documents to update.

new_object

    The object used to update the matched documents. This may either contain
    update operators (for modifying specific fields) or be a replacement
    document.

options

    An array of options for the update operation. Currently available options
    include:
      □ "upsert"

        If no document matches $criteria, a new document will be inserted.

        If a new document would be inserted and $new_object contains atomic
        modifiers (i.e. $ operators), those operations will be applied to the
        $criteria parameter to create the new document. If $new_object does not
        contain atomic modifiers, it will be used as-is for the inserted
        document. See the upsert examples below for more information.

      □ "multiple"

        All documents matching $criteria will be updated. 
        MongoCollection::update() has exactly the opposite behavior of 
        MongoCollection::remove(): it updates one document by default, not all
        matching documents. It is recommended that you always specify whether
        you want to update multiple documents or a single document, as the
        database may change its default behavior at some point in the future.

      □ "fsync"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Forces the insert to be synced to disk
        before returning success. If TRUE, an acknowledged insert is implied
        and will override setting w to 0.

      □ "j"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Forces the write operation to block until
        it is synced to the journal on disk. If TRUE, an acknowledged write is
        implied and this option will override setting "w" to 0.

            Note: If this option is used and journaling is disabled, MongoDB
            2.6+ will raise an error and the write will fail; older server
            versions will simply ignore the option.

      □ "socketTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for socket
        communication. If the server does not respond within the timeout
        period, a MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown and there will be
        no way to determine if the server actually handled the write or not. A
        value of -1 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 30000 (30 seconds).

      □ "w"

        See WriteConcerns. The default value for MongoClient is 1.

      □ "wTimeoutMS"

        This option specifies the time limit, in milliseconds, for write
        concern acknowledgement. It is only applicable when "w" is greater than
        1, as the timeout pertains to replication. If the write concern is not
        satisfied within the time limit, a MongoCursorException will be thrown.
        A value of 0 may be specified to block indefinitely. The default value
        for MongoClient is 10000 (ten seconds).

    The following options are deprecated and should no longer be used:
      □ "safe"

        Deprecated. Please use the WriteConcern w option.

      □ "timeout"

        Integer, defaults to MongoCursor::$timeout. If "safe" is set, this sets
        how long (in milliseconds) for the client to wait for a database
        response. If the database does not respond within the timeout period, a
        MongoCursorTimeoutException will be thrown.

      □ "wtimeout"

        Deprecated alias for "wTimeoutMS".

返回值

Returns an array containing the status of the update if the "w" option is set.
Otherwise, returns TRUE.

Fields in the status array are described in the documentation for 
MongoCollection::insert().

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if the "w" option is set and the write fails.

Throws MongoCursorTimeoutException if the "w" option is set to a value greater
than one and the operation takes longer than MongoCursor::$timeout milliseconds
to complete. This does not kill the operation on the server, it is a
client-side timeout. The operation in MongoCollection::$wtimeout is
milliseconds.

更新日志

 版本                                    说明
       Added the "wTimeoutMS" option, which replaces "wtimeout". Emits
       E_DEPRECATED when "wtimeout" is used.

1.5.0  Added the "socketTimeoutMS" option, which replaces "timeout". Emits
       E_DEPRECATED when "timeout" is used.

       Emits E_DEPRECATED when "safe" is used.

1.3.4  Added "wtimeout" option.
       Added "w" option.

1.3.0  The options parameter no longer accepts a boolean to signify an upsert.
       Instead, this now has to be done with array('upsert' => true).

1.2.11 Emits E_DEPRECATED when options is scalar.
1.2.0  Added "timeout" option.
1.0.11 Disconnects on "not master" errors if "safe" is set.
       Added ability to pass integers to the "safe" option, which previously
       only accepted booleans.

       Added "fsync" option.
1.0.9
       The return type was changed to be an array containing error information
       if the "safe" option is used. Otherwise, a boolean is returned as
       before.

1.0.5  Added "safe" option.
1.0.1  Changed options parameter from boolean to array. Pre-1.0.1, the second
       parameter was an optional boolean value specifying an upsert.

范例

Example #1 MongoCollection::update()

Adding an address field to a document.

<?php

$c->insert(array("firstname" => "Bob", "lastname" => "Jones" ));
$newdata = array('$set' => array("address" => "1 Smith Lane"));
$c->update(array("firstname" => "Bob"), $newdata);

var_dump($c->findOne(array("firstname" => "Bob")));

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

array(4) {
  ["_id"]=>
  object(MongoId)#6 (0) {
  }
  ["firstname"]=>
  string(3) "Bob"
  ["lastname"]=>
  string(5) "Jones"
  ["address"]=>
  string(12) "1 Smith Lane"
}

Example #2 MongoCollection::update() upsert examples

Upserts can simplify code, as a single line can create the document if it does
not exist (based on $criteria), or update an existing document if it matches.

In the following example, $new_object contains an atomic modifier. Since the
collection is empty and upsert must insert a new document, it will apply those
operations to the $criteria parameter in order to create the document.

<?php

$c->drop();
$c->update(
    array("uri" => "/summer_pics"),
    array('$inc' => array("page hits" => 1)),
    array("upsert" => true)
);
var_dump($c->findOne());

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

array(3) {
  ["_id"]=>
  object(MongoId)#9 (0) {
  }
  ["uri"]=>
  string(12) "/summer_pics"
  ["page hits"]=>
  int(1)
}

If $new_object does not contain atomic modifiers (i.e. $ operators), upsert
will use $new_object as-is for the new document. This matches the behavior of a
normal update, where not using atomic modifiers causes the document to be
overwritten.

<?php

$c->drop();
$c->update(
    array("name" => "joe"),
    array("username" => "joe312", "createdAt" => new MongoDate()), 
    array("upsert" => true)
);
var_dump($c->findOne());

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

array(3) {
  ["_id"]=>
  object(MongoId)#10 (0) {
  }
  ["username"]=>
  string(6) "joe312"
  ["createdAt"]=>
  object(MongoDate)#4 (0) {
  }
}

Example #3 MongoCollection::update() multiple example

By default, MongoCollection::update() will only update the first document
matching $criteria that it finds. Using the "multiple" option can override this
behavior, if needed.

This example adds a "gift" field to every person whose birthday is in the next
day.

<?php

$today = array('$gt' => new MongoDate(), '$lt' => new MongoDate(strtotime(
"+1 day")));
$people->update(
    array("birthday" => $today),
    array('$set' => array('gift' => $surprise)),
    array("multiple" => true)
);

?>

User Contributed Notes 7 notes

===============================================================================

For anyone referencing records by the Mongo _id object, it's important to
recognise that it is in fact an object, and not a string.

If you have a record with a Mongo ID of say "4e519d5118617e88f27ea8cd" that you
are trying to retrieve or update, you cannot search for it using something
like:
<?php
$m = new Mongo();
$db = $m->selectDB('db');
$collection = 'collection';
$db->$collection->findOne(array('_id', '4e519d5118617e88f27ea8cd'));
?>

There is some documentation that mentions simple conversion to string will
solve this, but I have found the only reliable way to locate records based on
their ID is to first pass it to MondoID(), then use that for reference.

Something like this will be far more reliable:
<?php
$m = new Mongo();
$db = $m->selectDB('db');
$collection = 'collection';
$mongoID = new MongoID('4e519d5118617e88f27ea8cd');
$db->$collection->findOne(array('_id', $mongoID));
?>

This may prove useful for anyone using the ID object like an auto-increment
database key would be used in MySQL or similar.
===============================================================================

Please note under optional third parameter "options":

While the official MongoDB documentation references the keyword "multi" to flag
the use of multiple updates, the PHP implementation uses the key "multiple"
instead.

This may cause a little confusion if you're basing your keys on the OFFICIAL
MongoDB documentation.
===============================================================================

if you want emulate on mongoDb "insert on duplicate key update" in SQL
notation, you must use flag "upsert" with "$set" in "update" operation.

In this sample uses unique key (user id and product id) and date user visit 
product:page. Each execute this code make update 'lasttime' field:

<?php
$client = new \MongoClient(MONGO_DB);
$users = $client->users;
$last_views = $users->createCollection('last_views');
// create unique index
$result = $last_views->ensureIndex(
    array("user_id" => 1, "warecode" => 1),
    array("unique" => 1)
);

$uviews = new \stdClass();
$uviews->user_id = $this->user_id;
$uviews->warecode = $this->warecode;

$res = $users->last_views->update(
    $uviews,
    array('$set' => array('lasttime' => new \MongoTimestamp())),
    array('upsert' => true)
);
?>
===============================================================================

Re. nerds @ limeworks comment:
Thanks for your helpful tip - right what I was looking for.  One note, though:
Instead of comma, it's a => as in:
<?php
...->findOne(array('_id' => $mongoID);
?>
===============================================================================

Do note, for incrementing a value using $inc, typecast the value to an integer
before passing the new object to update().

<?php
$votes = (int) $votes;
$newData = array('$inc' => array('votes'=>$votes));
$c->update(array("firstname" => "Bob"), $newData);
?>

This is especially noteworthy, if you are taking values from $_GET and pushing
them for increment.
===============================================================================

The return type of update changed in 1.09 if you are using safe => TRUE. It now
returns something that looks like the info returned by MongoDB::lastError:

Array
(
    [err] =>
    [updatedExisting] => 1
    [n] => 1
    [ok] => 1
)
===============================================================================

A need for an app was to add a new entry to the industries collection if it
didn't already exist, and pass that "string" _id back to the caller to add it
to the businesses collection (as a string also - database design by others....
:))

function GetIndustryID($db, $industry_name_eng, $industry_name_rus) {

// $db is the MongoDB database object
// $industry_name_eng is English of the industry name
// $industry_name_rus is Russian of the industry name

    if ( $industry_name_eng == "" && $industry_name_rus == "" ) {
        return "";
        exit;
    }
   
    // lookup russian version
    // of industry name from industries collection and try to return the _id
  
    // if not found, add this as a new document and return its _id

        // $c_ind = industry collection object
        // "industries" is the collection name

    $c_ind = $db->industries;

// you could use findOne here....
    $cursor = $c_ind->find(array('industry_name.russian' =>
$industry_name_rus));

    if ( $cursor->hasNext() ) {
        foreach ( $cursor as $document ) {         
            $id = $document['_id'];
        }
    } else {
        // not found here - go add it
        $document = array(
            "industry_id" => "",
            "industry_name" => array("english" => $industry_name_eng, "russian"
=> $industry_name_rus )
        );
        $db->industries->insert($document);
        $id = $document['_id'];   
       
        // update the industry_id in the industries collection
        // with the id returned - because we just added it, and
        // we need the industry_id the same as the _id
       
        // see: http://php.net/manual/en/mongocollection.update.php
       
        // update ( array $criteria , array $new_object [, array $options =
array() ] )

                // note how I cast the MongoID "object" to a string
        $document['industry_id'] = (string)$id;
                // the $id in the next line is the ObjectID, not a string.
        $db->industries->update(array("_id" => $id), $document, array("upsert"
=> true));
    }
  
    return (string)$id;
              
}

Results: (using RoboMongo)
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5427acf7a495dbd420b2e2ea"),
    "industry_id" : "5427acf7a495dbd420b2e2ea",
    "industry_name" : {
        "english" : "Oil and Gas",
        "russian" : "Нефть, Газ, Энергетика"
    }
}

It took me ages to work this out. Hope it helps someone else.

socket_get_option — Gets socket options for the socket

说明

mixed socket_get_option ( resource $socket , int $level , int $optname )

The socket_get_option() function retrieves the value for the option specified
by the optname parameter for the specified socket.

参数

socket

    A valid socket resource created with socket_create() or socket_accept().

level

    The level parameter specifies the protocol level at which the option
    resides. For example, to retrieve options at the socket level, a level
    parameter of SOL_SOCKET would be used. Other levels, such as TCP, can be
    used by specifying the protocol number of that level. Protocol numbers can
    be found by using the getprotobyname() function.

                             is present. By default,
                             when the socket is
                             closed, it attempts to
                             send all unsent data.

                             to acknowledge the
                             data.

                             If l_onoff is non-zero
                             and l_linger is zero,
                             all the unsent data

                             On the other hand, if
                             l_onoff is non-zero and
                             l_linger is non-zero, 
                             socket_close() will

                             l_linger elapses. If
                             the socket is
                             non-blocking, 
                             socket_close() will

===============================================================================

If using Unix Sockets, and you want to use SO_PEERCRED, you can use the number
17 for the optname (and SOL_SOCKET for the level).  The PID of the connecting
process will be returned.
===============================================================================

Just 2 notes here:
- On UNIX, If SO_DEBUG is set, the php program needs an effective user id of 0.
-  activating SO_OOBINLINE on a socket is equivalent to passing MSG_OOB flag to
each recieving functions used with that socket (eg: socket_recv,
socket_recvfrom).
===============================================================================

I was playing around with this option to use multiply socket connections with
same hostname and same port (IRC). However the socket function needed for this
is SO_REUSEPORT.

Though the majority of linux distro's does not have that yet officially
implented in there distro's.

However for debian there is an patch that can be installed to get it working:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=
c617f398edd4db2b8567a28e899a88f8f574798d

it has some work but I got it working after a while (Noobie in debian) maybe
some other people are facing the same problem as I was.

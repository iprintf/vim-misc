The MongoCursor class

(PECL mongo >=0.9.0)

简介

A cursor is used to iterate through the results of a database query. For
example, to query the database and see all results, you could do:

Example #1 MongoCursor basic usage

<?php

$cursor = $collection->find();
var_dump(iterator_to_array($cursor));

?>

You don't generally create cursors using the MongoCursor constructor, you get a
new cursor by calling MongoCollection::find() (as shown above).

Suppose that, in the example above, $collection was a 50GB collection. We
certainly wouldn't want to load that into memory all at once, which is what a
cursor is for: allowing the client to access the collection in dribs and drabs.

If we have a large result set, we can iterate through it, loading a few
megabytes of results into memory at a time. For example, we could do:

Example #2 Iterating over MongoCursor

<?php

$cursor = $collection->find();

foreach ($cursor as $doc) {
    // do something to each document
}

?>
This will go through each document in the collection, loading and garbage
collecting documents as needed.

Note that this means that a cursor does not "contain" the database results, it
just manages them. Thus, if you print a cursor (with, say, var_dump() or 
print_r()), you'll just get the cursor object, not your documents. To get the
documents themselves, you can use one of the methods shown above.

Cursor Stages

A MongoCursor has two "life stages": pre- and post- query. When a cursor is
created, it has not yet contacted the database, so it is in its pre-query
state. In this state, the client can further specify what they want the query
to do, including adding limits, skips, sorts, and more advanced options.

When the client attempts to get a result (by calling MongoCursor::next(),
directly or indirectly), the cursor moves into the post-query stage. At this
point, the query has been executed by the database and cannot be modified
anymore.

Example #3 Adding options to MongoCursor

<?php

$cursor = $collection->find()->limit(10);

// database has not yet been queried, so more search options can be added
$cursor = $cursor->sort(array("a" => 1));

var_dump($cursor->getNext());
// now database has been queried and more options cannot be added

// so this will throw an exception:
$cursor->skip(4);
?>

Static Variables

slaveOkay

    If the query should have the "slaveOkay" flag set, which allows reads on
    the secondary (secondaries are, by default, just for backup and not
    queried). Can be overridden with MongoCursor::slaveOkay().

    This functionality is deprecated. Please use 读取首选项 instead.

timeout

    Set timeout in milliseconds for all database responses. Use -1 to wait
    forever. Can be overridden with MongoCursor::timeout(). This does not cause
    the MongoDB server to cancel the operation; it only instructs the driver to
    stop waiting for a response and throw a MongoCursorTimeoutException after a
    set time.

User Contributed Notes 3 notes

===============================================================================

One *VERY* important note, if You do:
$cursor = $collection->find(array(), array('_id' => 0)); // ommit '_id' field
in result

then:
var_dump(iterator_to_array($cursor));

will return only *ONE* document, not all!
===============================================================================

If you want to know whether a cursor returned any results it is faster to use
'hasNext()' than 'count'
===============================================================================

The documentation says $timeout is a static variable that can be set:

"Set timeout in milliseconds for all database responses."

This feature has been deprecated. Attempting to set it will result in a warning
:

"PHP Deprecated:  MongoCollection::find(): The 'MongoCursor::$timeout' static
property is deprecated, please call MongoCursor->timeout() instead"

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mb_send_mail — 发送编码过的邮件

说明

bool mb_send_mail ( string $to , string $subject , string $message [, string
$additional_headers = NULL [, string $additional_parameter = NULL ]] )

发送邮件。邮件头和内容根据 mb_language() 设置来转换编码。这是 mail() 的一个包装
器函数，所以详情参见 mail()。

参数

to

    被发送到该邮件地址。可通过逗号分隔地址的 to 来指定多个收件人。该参数不会被
    自动编码。

subject

    邮件标题。

message

    邮件消息。

additional_headers(可选)

    String to be inserted at the end of the email header.

    This is typically used to add extra headers (From, Cc, and Bcc). Multiple
    extra headers should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). Validate parameter
    not to be injected unwanted headers by attackers.

        Note:

        When sending mail, the mail must contain a From header. This can be set
        with the additional_headers parameter, or a default can be set in
        php.ini.

        Failing to do this will result in an error message similar to Warning:
        mail(): "sendmail_from" not set in php.ini or custom "From:" header
        missing. The From header sets also Return-Path under Windows.

        Note:

        If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some Unix mail
        transfer agents (most notably » qmail) replace LF by CRLF automatically
        (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last
        resort, as it does not comply with » RFC 2822.

additional_parameter

    additional_parameter 是一个 MTA 命令行参数。在使用 sendmail 时对设置正确的
    返回路径头很有帮助。

    This parameter is escaped by escapeshellcmd() internally to prevent command
    execution. escapeshellcmd() prevents command execution, but allows to add
    addtional parameters. For security reason, this parameter should be
    validated.

    Since escapeshellcmd() is applied automatically, some characters that are
    allowed as email addresses by internet RFCs cannot be used. Programs that
    are required to use these characters mail() cannot be used.

    The user that the webserver runs as should be added as a trusted user to
    the sendmail configuration to prevent a 'X-Warning' header from being added
    to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this method. For
    sendmail users, this file is /etc/mail/trusted-users.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

If you have problem using mb_send_mail to send utf-8 mails, you have to know
the following things (I've spent hours on the net before finding the correct
php code) :

- You have to use the mb_encode_mimeheader function on the sender name and on
the recipient name (on names, not on emails !).
- Subject and message are automatically encoded.
- Add - at least - the following header :

$headers = "Mime-Version: 1.0\n";
$headers .= "Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8\n";
$headers .= "From: $sender";

- Last but not least, beware of the internal encoding, which is needed by
mb_encode_mimeheader function in order to encode properly. I had to set the
internal encoding to UTF-8 in order to make it work properly :

mb_internal_encoding("UTF-8");
===============================================================================

Make sure that if you're using a form to type in the mail, that your form page
has the right encoding, like if I want to send out a japanese email, by filling
out a form, the form page needs this in the header:
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=SHIFT-JIS">
===============================================================================

I have to use Japanese hankaku (single byte kana in (S)JIS) in mail subject and
message,
so I tried the way that NO3L in Japan said, but I found there's a big problem.
In that way, mb_encode_mimeheader drop escape sequence from the head of encoded
string from second line.
if you use long letter in subject, and if it includes multi byte string, It
must crashed.
Therefore, if you want to use Japanese hankaku in mail subject, you might try
like this.
Encoded subject letters in one line is not just 76 letters, so it is not based
on RFC, but it work.

$intSubjectLength  = mb_strlen($strSubject);
$intSeparateLength = 10;
for ($i=0; $i<ceil($intSubjectLength / $intSeparateLength); $i++) {
    $arrSeparatedSubject[$i] = mb_substr($strSubject, $intIndex,
$intSeparateLength);
    $arrSeparatedSubject[$i] = mb_encode_mimeheader(mb_convert_encoding
($arrSeparatedSubject[$i], "JIS", "EUC-JP"));
    $intIndex = $intIndex + $intSeparateLength;
}
$strSubject = join("\n ", $arrSeparatedSubject);

# self-fix...
I posted "encode_mimeheader" workaround on the day before. But I found that the
code depends on platforms. :(

In some platforms, hedders(after the header splited into two or more lines)
will appear in the body content.
The cause is that 'there are some platforms where the translation from \n to \r
\n is apparently done for you'.
# See the post by "leon at ietsmet dot nl" about mail function (23-Apr-2003).

Now, all you have to do is just changing the glue string from "\r\n " to "\n ".

function encode_mimeheader($str, $indent = 0, $encoding = 'utf-8',
$mail_encoding = 'iso-2022-jp')
{
         ..... lefted out (all same).....
  $str = join("\r\n ", $lines); // RFC 2047,822 say newline must be ^\r\n, not
only\n
  return $str;
}

should be below in some platform...

function encode_mimeheader($str, $indent = 0, $encoding = 'utf-8',
$mail_encoding = 'iso-2022-jp')
{
         ..... lefted out (all same).....
  $str = join("\n ", $lines);
  // Though RFC 2047,822 say newline must be \r\n, not only \n,
  // in my platform, auto replacement will be done (accepts \n and \n\r\n -> \n
\n)...
  return $str;
}

# notice: In both code, 1 space after newline is essential (gule str is *not*
only "\r\n" nor "\n").
# This space is ignored only between encoded-words.

    c.f. about efficiency

Thinking about efficiency, my encode_mimeheader may have to determine where to
split string into lines without mb_encode_mimeheader in the determining loop.
But that loop will be repeated only one or a few times and this function  will
be usually used against not so long string. So, this loss is not critical in
most case.
If you use only one encoding, you can easily check ascii or multi-byte char one
by one accoding to the definition of the encoding and determining splitting
point (this is far faster), but when you have to handle all encoding that is
not so easy. At least, I don't want to touch. :p
To accept *any* encoding (encoding name will be passed as argument), you can
use this code. This is because I post non-efficient code like this.
# Though I'm not sure whether the code actually work well with all encoding...
===============================================================================

As others say, mb_encode_mimeheader() seems to have a bug with JIS(ISO-2022-JP)
encording. Token indicating start and end of multibyte char is inserted only
before start of encoding and after the all.
We need the tokens at start and end of *all* encoded-text.
# PHP 4.3.2

So, we needs some workaround.

The post by "gordon at kanazawa-gu dot ac dot jp" seems to work well, but it
doesn't. JIS nees some special tokens and base64_encode does'nt output them, so
the code cannot used.

The post "RE: N03L in Japan", which simply splitting words in eash 10 chars is
good enough in most case, there are some problem left. When there are some
splited parts starting with ascii chars, 1 additional space will be inserted.
# RFC2047 only say within 76 words, shorter is not bad.

Additionally, thought it is really rare case, when we use "=?charset?" as
literal string, we have to escape them.
# Some mailer can actually send this without escape and header will be broken.
:(

Now, a little non-smart but maybe more accurate code is below function. I
tested only with ISO-2022-JP, only in costomized phpBB2.0.5, only some cases.
As far as my test this code worked well, but I'm not sure.

# $str: source text
# $indent: ex. for "Subject: " header, give 9 and first line will be shorter
than 76-1-9=66
# $encoding: source text encoding
# $mail_encoding: $str will be converted into this before base64 encode

function encode_mimeheader($str, $indent = 0, $encoding = 'utf-8',
$mail_encoding = 'iso-2022-jp')
{
  $start_delimiter = strtoupper("=?$mail_encoding?B?");
  $start_pattern   = strtoupper("=\\?$mail_encoding\\?B\\?");
  $end_delimiter   = '?=';

  $str = mb_convert_encoding($str, $mail_encoding, $encoding);
  $length  = mb_strlen($str, $mail_encoding);
  $max_part_length = 20; // enough short in most case (you can change this
default value)
   
  for ($i=0, $index=0; $index<$length; $i++) {
    $part_length = $max_part_length;
    $s = mb_substr($str, $index, $part_length, $mail_encoding);
    // workaround for literally used start delimiter (without below, subject
may break)
    // note: mb_encode_mimeheader() don't encode ascii including start
delimiter
    if (preg_match('/^' . $start_pattern . '/i', $s))
    {
      $lines[$i] = $start_delimiter . base64_encode($start_delimiter) . "?=";
      $index += strlen($start_delimiter);
      continue;
    }

    $lines[$i] = mb_encode_mimeheader($s, $mail_encoding);
    while (strlen($lines[$i]) > 76-1 - ($i?0:$indent)) { // max par line -
first space - indent (first line only)
      $part_length = floor($part_length * (76-1 - ($i?0:$indent)) / strlen
($lines[$i])); // at least 1 decrement
      $s = mb_substr($str, $index, $part_length, $mail_encoding);
      $lines[$i] = mb_encode_mimeheader($s, $mail_encoding);
    }
   
    // workaround for starting new line with ascii (without below, 1 space may
cut in)
    // note: mb_encode_mimeheader() starts encode after encounterring multibyte
char
    if ($i > 0 && !preg_match('/^' . $start_pattern . '/i', $lines[$i]))
    {
      $p = strpos($lines[$i], $start_delimiter); //never 0 (false when not
found)
      $p = $p ? $p : strlen($lines[$i]);
      $lines[$i] = $start_delimiter . base64_encode(substr($lines[$i], 0, $p))
. "?=";
      $part_length = $p;
    }
    $index += $part_length;
  }
  $str = join("\r\n ", $lines); // RFC 2047,822 say newline must be ^\r\n, not
only\n
  return $str;
}
===============================================================================

There is another way of encoding Japanese language to send email without
worrying about mb_functions:

Download PHP Jcode from http://www.spencernetwork.org/
and use JcodeConvert function with base64_encode function for the e-mail header
and the subject.

$email_to = "blah@blah.com";

$_POST["name"] = strip_tags(trim($_POST["name"]));
$name = "=?ISO-2022-JP?B?". base64_encode(JcodeConvert($_POST["name"], 2, 3)).
"?=";
$_POST["email"] = strip_tags(trim($_POST["email"]));
$_POST["subject"] = strip_tags(trim($_POST["subject"]));
$email_subject = "=?ISO-2022-JP?B?". base64_encode(JcodeConvert($_POST
["subject"], 2, 3)). "?=";
$_POST["body"] = strip_tags(trim($_POST["body"]));

$email_header = "From: $name <". $_POST["email"] .">\n";
$email_header .= "Reply-To: ". $_POST["email"] ."\n";
$email_header .= "Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit\n";
$email_header .= "Content-type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-2022-jp\"\n\n";

$email_body = "blah blah blah.\n"

mail($email_to, $email_subject, $email_body, $email_header);
===============================================================================

I was trying to send japanese email and had a hell of a time getting it to
work. I finally stumbled across mb_send_mail() and it did everything I wanted
*except* that it only send plain text emails ... sending HTML contents was
impossible.

I finally whipped this up. I'm posting in case someone finds it useful.

function send_japanese_mail($to, $subject, $body, $from, $from_email,
$is_html_content=false) {

   $headers  = "MIME-Version: 1.0\\n" ;
   $headers .= "From: $from <$from_email>\\n";
   $headers .= "Reply-To: $from <$from_email>\\n";

  /* If the body  is HTML or plain text set the Content-Type header accordingly
*/

   if ($is_html_content) {
     $headers .= "Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-2022-JP\\n";
     /* turn all line breaks into BR tags */
     $body = nl2br($body);
   }
     else {
     $headers .= "Content-Type: text/plain;charset=ISO-2022-JP\\n";
   }

  /* need to convert body to same encoding as stated in Content-Type header
above */

  $body = mb_convert_encoding($body, "ISO-2022-JP","AUTO");

  /* set any sendmail params, optional ... */
  $sendmail_params  = "-f$from_email";

  /*
   The subject is actually a "header" and can/will get mangled
   if it contains non-ASCII characters. So we need to convert
   the subject to something containing only ASCII characters.

   First we convert the subject to the same encoding as the
   body, then we use mb_encode_mimeheader() to make the subject
   line all ASCII characters.
  */

   mb_language("ja");
   $subject = mb_convert_encoding($subject, "ISO-2022-JP","AUTO");
   $subject = mb_encode_mimeheader($subject);

   mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers, $sendmail_params);
}
===============================================================================

I had to use mb_internal_encoding() also to get properly encoded message.
===============================================================================

You may not use mb_encode_mimeheader() with mb_convert_encoding() to make
subject as follows. It causes mojibake in several strings.
mb_encode_mimeheader( mb_convert_encoding($strMailSubj, "JIS", "EUC-JP") )

Set mb_internal_encoding() to *subject's* encoding and call
mb_encode_mimeheader.

Example)

    $__lang = mb_language();
    $__enc = mb_internal_encoding();
    mb_language("Japanese");
    mb_internal_encoding( mb_detect_encoding($subject) );
    #mb_internal_encoding( "EUC-JP" ); #just do when you know encoding of
$subject
    mail($to,
        mb_encode_mimeheader($subject),
        mb_convert_encoding($msg,"JIS","AUTO"),$header);
    mb_internal_encoding( $__enc );
    mb_language($__lang);
===============================================================================

First of all, don't use nl2br in newer php versions unless you WANT to write
xhtml...you'll get <br /> tags.

Secondly, you should use JIS, not ISO-2022-JP as the convert TO encoding.  If
you use ISO... mb_encode_mimeheader seems to fail. They're the same charset
anyway.

Now here's why I am really writing.  I just discovered that mb_send_mail and
mb_encode_mimeheader cannot support hankaku (single byte kana in (S)JIS) at
all.  If you are making apps for the keitai (mobile) market, this won't do. 
Therefore, undo your overloading on the mail function and use regular mail and
convert everything yourself like this.  This is what we did.  It seems to work
for us.  Your mileage may vary.

$strMBS = mb_convert_encoding($strMailBodySend, "JIS", "EUC-JP");

$strMS  = mb_encode_mimeheader( mb_convert_encoding($strMailSubj, "JIS",
"EUC-JP") );

mail($strToMail, $strMS, $strMBS, $strFrom);
===============================================================================

If your server doesn't have mb_send_mail() enabled but you want to use
non-ascii (multi-byte) chars in an email's subject or name headers, you can use
something like the following:

$charset = "iso-2202-jp"; // japanese
$to = encode("japanese name 01", $charset) . " <to@email.com>";
$from = encode("japanese name 02", $charset) . " <from@email.com>";
$subject = encode("japanese text", $charset);
$message = "does not need to be encoded";
mail($to, $subject, $message, $from);

function encode($in_str, $charset) {
    $out_str = $in_str;
    if ($out_str && $charset) {

        // define start delimimter, end delimiter and spacer
        $end = "?=";
        $start = "=?" . $charset . "?B?";
        $spacer = $end . "\r\n " . $start;

        // determine length of encoded text within chunks
        // and ensure length is even
        $length = 75 - strlen($start) - strlen($end);
        $length = floor($length/2) * 2;

        // encode the string and split it into chunks
        // with spacers after each chunk
        $out_str = base64_encode($out_str);
        $out_str = chunk_split($out_str, $length, $spacer);

        // remove trailing spacer and
        // add start and end delimiters
        $spacer = preg_quote($spacer);
        $out_str = preg_replace("/" . $spacer . "$/", "", $out_str);
        $out_str = $start . $out_str . $end;
    }
    return $out_str;
}

// for Non-ASCII Text see ...

===============================================================================

Tested with PHP 4.2.2 on Linux: Please note that if you're using Unicode
(mb_language("uni")) and you attempt to send mail with mb_send_mail(), you will
need to base64_encode() the message body - mb_send_mail() doesn't do that for
you. It does, however, issue the correct message headers, so you don't need to
worry about that.

Also note that neither mb_language() nor mb_send_mail() is able to convert your
message to UTF-8. *You* need to provide the UTF-8-encoded (and base64-encoded)
message, and then mb_send_mail() will issue the correct message headers.

Here's an example of sending an UTF-8-encoded message with mb_send_mail():

mb_language("uni");
$body = chunk_split(base64_encode("International characters"));
mb_send_mail("someone@example.com", "Subject", $body);

If the receiving mail client supports UTF-8 properly, you will be able to send
messages that contain a mix of all kinds of characters (e.g., you could send
Thai, Chinese, and Danish characters in the same message). Not all mail clients
support UTF-8, though. At the time of writing, some of the more popular Windows
email clients - Eudora and Pegasus Mail - don't. There are a number of email
clients with working support for UTF-8. These include Outlook Express, KMail,
Mozilla, Netscape 6/7, Sylpheed, Evolution and others.
===============================================================================

Yes, as far as I understood the function encodes the entrire message body with
base64 and that's why it can be used to send messages with attachments.
===============================================================================

Be careful, mb_send_mail chokes if you try and send a multipart e-mail.
===============================================================================

While using the right tags mentioned in other comments (mb_internal_encoding,
Content-Type, etc) ...

mb_send_mail would properly encode special characters in plain text emails, for
both subject and message

mb_send_mail would not properly encode special characters in subject for
multi-part messages (text+html)

(^)

SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges — Applies the changes made to a data graph
back to the database.

说明

void SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges ( PDO $database_handle , SDODataObject
$root_data_object )
Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Given a PDO database handle and the special root object of a data graph,
examine the change summary in the datagraph and applies the changes to the
database. The changes that it can apply can be creations of data objects,
deletes of data objects, and modifications to properties of data objects.

参数

PDO_database_handle

    Constructed using the PDO extension. A typical line to construct a PDO
    database handle might look like this:
    $dbh = new PDO("mysql:dbname=COMPANYDB;host=
    localhost",DATABASE_USER,DATABASE_PASSWORD);

root_data_object

    The special root object which is at the top of every SDO data graph.

返回值

None. Note however that the datagraph that was passed is still intact and
usable. Furthermore, if data objects were created and written back to a table
with autogenerated primary keys, then those primary keys will now be set in the
data objects. If the changes were successfully written, then the change summary
associated with the datagraph will have been cleared, so that it is possible to
now make further changes to the data graph and apply those changes in turn. In
this way it is possible to work with the same data graph and apply changes
repeatedly.

错误／异常

SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges() can throw an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception if
it is unable to apply all the changes correctly.

The Relational DAS starts a database transaction before beginning to apply the
changes and will commit the transaction only if they are all successful. The
Relational DAS generates qualified update and delete statements which contain a
where clause that specifies that the row to be updated or deleted must contain
the same values that it did when the data was first retrieved. This is how the
optimistic concurrency is implemented. If any of the qualified update or delete
statements fails to update or delete their target row, it may be because the
data has been altered in the database in the meantime. In any event, if any
update fails for any reason, the transaction is rolled back and an exception
thrown. The exception will contain the generated SQL statement that failed.

The Relational DAS also catches any PDO exceptions and obtains PDO diagnostic
information which it includes in an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception which it then
throws.

范例

Please see the Examples section in the general information about the Relational
DAS for many examples of calling this method. Please see also the section on
Tracing to see how you can see what SQL statements are generated by the
Relational DAS.

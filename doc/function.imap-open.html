imap_open — Open an IMAP stream to a mailbox

说明

resource imap_open ( string $mailbox , string $username , string $password [, 
int $options = 0 [, int $n_retries = 0 [, array $params = NULL ]]] )

Opens an IMAP stream to a mailbox.

This function can also be used to open streams to POP3 and NNTP servers, but
some functions and features are only available on IMAP servers.

参数

mailbox

    A mailbox name consists of a server and a mailbox path on this server. The
    special name INBOX stands for the current users personal mailbox. Mailbox
    names that contain international characters besides those in the printable
    ASCII space have to be encoded width imap_utf7_encode().

    The server part, which is enclosed in '{' and '}', consists of the servers
    name or ip address, an optional port (prefixed by ':'), and an optional
    protocol specification (prefixed by '/').

    The server part is mandatory in all mailbox parameters.

    All names which start with { are remote names, and are in the form "{"
    remote_system_name [":" port] [flags] "}" [mailbox_name] where:
      □ remote_system_name - Internet domain name or bracketed IP address of
        server.
      □ port - optional TCP port number, default is the default port for that
        service
      □ flags - optional flags, see following table.
      □ mailbox_name - remote mailbox name, default is INBOX

                           Optional flags for names
             Flag                              Description
    /service=service       mailbox access service, default is "imap"
    /user=user             remote user name for login on the server
                           remote authentication user; if specified this is the
    /authuser=user         user name whose password is used (e.g.
                           administrator)
    /anonymous             remote access as anonymous user
    /debug                 record protocol telemetry in application's debug log
    /secure                do not transmit a plaintext password over the
                           network
    /imap, /imap2, /
    imap2bis, /imap4, /    equivalent to /service=imap
    imap4rev1
    /pop3                  equivalent to /service=pop3
    /nntp                  equivalent to /service=nntp
    /norsh                 do not use rsh or ssh to establish a
                           preauthenticated IMAP session
    /ssl                   use the Secure Socket Layer to encrypt the session
    /validate-cert         validate certificates from TLS/SSL server (this is
                           the default behavior)
    /novalidate-cert       do not validate certificates from TLS/SSL server,
                           needed if server uses self-signed certificates
    /tls                   force use of start-TLS to encrypt the session, and
                           reject connection to servers that do not support it
    /notls                 do not do start-TLS to encrypt the session, even
                           with servers that support it
    /readonly              request read-only mailbox open (IMAP only; ignored
                           on NNTP, and an error with SMTP and POP3)

Example #1 Different use of imap_open()

<?php
// To connect to an IMAP server running on port 143 on the local machine,
// do the following:
$mbox = imap_open("{localhost:143}INBOX", "user_id", "password");

// To connect to a POP3 server on port 110 on the local server, use:
$mbox = imap_open ("{localhost:110/pop3}INBOX", "user_id", "password");

// To connect to an SSL IMAP or POP3 server, add /ssl after the protocol
// specification:
$mbox = imap_open ("{localhost:993/imap/ssl}INBOX", "user_id", "password");

// To connect to an SSL IMAP or POP3 server with a self-signed certificate,
// add /ssl/novalidate-cert after the protocol specification:
$mbox = imap_open ("{localhost:995/pop3/ssl/novalidate-cert}", "user_id", 
"password");

// To connect to an NNTP server on port 119 on the local server, use:
$nntp = imap_open ("{localhost:119/nntp}comp.test", "", "");
// To connect to a remote server replace "localhost" with the name or the
// IP address of the server you want to connect to.

One of the issues with gmail IMAP SSL authentication is related to Google's
account security.

Once you get the login error once, sign out of all your google accounts. Then,
visit this link:
http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

Log in with the account you're attempting to access via imap.

Follow the steps and you'll then be able to login in to gmail with php imap.

It's visually shown here:
http://jeffreifman.com/
filtered-open-source-imap-mail-filtering-software-for-php/configuring-gmail/
===============================================================================

Using:
<?php
imap_open( "{server.example.com:143}INBOX" , 'login' , 'password' );
?>

Got this error:
"Couldn't open stream {server.example.com:143}INBOX"

Solved by adding the flag "novalidate-cert":
<?php
imap_open( "{server.example.com:143/novalidate-cert}INBOX" , 'login' , 
'password' );
?>

=D
===============================================================================

Since Version 5.3.2 there's a 6th parameter available to disable authentication
with GSSAPI or NTLM:

Example:
<?php
$mbox = imap_open("{w2010ExchangeServer:993/imap/ssl}", $user, $password, NULL,
1, array('DISABLE_AUTHENTICATOR' => 'GSSAPI'));
?>

This solves the problem with Exchange 2010 for me. As a reference see https://
bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33500
===============================================================================

For all imap functions where you specify the mailbox string it is important
that you ALWAYS use IP (not hostname) and the portnumber. If you do not do this
imap functions will be painfully slow.
Using hostname instead of IP adds 3 seconds to each IMAP call, not using
portnumber adds 10 seconds to each imap call. (hint: use gethostbyname() )
===============================================================================

imap_open is very simple to use, but struggles a litte bit on setups with ssl
and tls.

this are tested examples for different hosts and protocols.

uncomment the host/protocol line and fill in correct username and password.

Subfolders of INBOX have to be seperate by dot like this: 'INBOX.test'

===============================================================================

I managed to use this function against Exchange 2010 without recompiling to
disable kerberos

It's important to me that php installs per the standard package (yum install
php)

Exchange 2010 triggers kerberos in php, and you require the kinit thing (search
around google for "imap_open kinit exchange 2010" and you will find this)

To get it working I had to:
1. setup the krb5.conf file correctly
2. do a kinit username@DOMAIN.DOM with a valid username / password
3. rename the ticket file to reflect the user id of apache (usually 48)
   /tmp/krb5cc_48
4. fix ownership
   chown apache.apache /tmp/krb5cc_48

but the exchange server will use the kerberos ticket and not the username
password - unless you use ssl

<?php

    $imap_user = "username";
    $imap_pass = "password";
    $imap_server = "{w2010kExchangeServer:993/novalidate-cert/ssl}";

    $mbox = imap_open("{$imap_server}INBOX", $imap_user, $imap_pass);

    $sorted_mbox = imap_sort($mbox, SORTDATE, 0);
    $totalrows = imap_num_msg($mbox);
    print "$imap_server\n";

    $startvalue = 0;
    while ($startvalue < $totalrows) {

        $headers = imap_fetchheader($mbox, $sorted_mbox[ $startvalue ] );
        $subject = array();
        preg_match_all('/^Subject: (.*)/m', $headers, $subject);
        print $subject[1][0] . "\n";

        $startvalue++;
    }
?>
   
One small step for php / exchange, one Giant leap for David  ....
===============================================================================

By default, imap_open() will retry an incorrect password 3 times before giving
up.  This is a feature built into the c-client library intended for interactive
mail clients (which can prompt the end user for a new username/password combo.)

The new optional parameter "$n_retries" allows PHP to override the default
retry limit.  There is absolutely no reason to leave this at default, or to set
it to any value other than 1.  This is especially important if the mail server
you're using locks users out after too many login failures.
===============================================================================

You can do

<? $foo = imap_errors(); ?>

to clear unwanted warning messages like 'Mailbox is empty'

Hi

I was struggling with the Gmail Imap/pop connection. It keeps saying too many
failed login connections were made.

Thing I did:
https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
Clicked "Turn on"
> worked!

So last step could be used but remember your account will be at a certain
security risk. Anyway it comes in handy to develop...
===============================================================================

My script kept on timing out, even though the syntax was spot on... ultimately,
I figured out that the port was blocked by my webhost, where I ran this on a
shared server...

I post this just in case you miss this obvious, like I did.
===============================================================================

None of the above comments explain the configuration issues on Apache/Windows
combination. I thought it might be helpful to list my findings here so that
Windows people's time is saved.

There is a bug in Windows php_imap.dll that prevents it from connecting it to
the SSL IMAP/POP3 server.

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36496&edit=1
===============================================================================

An old archived 2006 PHP script to retrieve IMAP POP3 email into a MySQL
database and as files is at:
http://web.archive.org/web/20060411020022/http://www.sellchain.com/phPOP3/
phPOP3.txt
===============================================================================

Do not bother using "/debug" flag in $mailbox or OP_DEBUG in $options. They do
not do anything.

When you set either one, the underlying IMAP c-client library will gather
protocol debugging data and pass it back to PHP.
However, the debug handler defined by PHP is an empty function, it doesn't do
anything.

So unless you're using a customized version of the IMAP extension that does
something with that handler (mm_dlog), there is no point using "/debug" or
OP_DEBUG.
===============================================================================

"Couldn't open stream {127.0.0.1:143/imap/notls}INBOX"

Solved by only replacing 127.0.0.1 with localhost, php and IMAP server both in
same machine, not through Proxy or anything. Weird!
===============================================================================

If you get slow imap4/pop3 authentication step
i.e. 5-10 sec just for response, maybe you are connecting to an imap server
which is advertising GSSAPI auth mechanism.
Martin Eckardt note could help to speed it up.
<?php
$mbox = imap_open("{imap server with GSSAPI :993/imap/ssl}", $user, $password, 
NULL, 1, array('DISABLE_AUTHENTICATOR' => 'GSSAPI'));
?>

Disable GSSAPI if you dont use it.
If your imap/pop server is Dovecot
/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
...
auth_mechanisms = plain login gssapi
-> auth_mechanisms = plain login
===============================================================================

imap_open will not open a stream if your server operates with Transport Layer
Security (i.e. TLS) imap_open connects with SSL if its there. So try opening
mailbox as

$mailbox="{mail.domain.com:143/imap/notls}";
or
$mailbox="{mail.domain.com:110/pop3/notls}"; This works...

Some mail server requires you to provide username@domain.com so you can always
use. user@doamin.com

$conn=imap_open($mailbox, $username, $password);

Some server may ask for username as "user=user@domain.com"

:)
===============================================================================

The error: Unknown: Mailbox is empty (errflg=1) in Unknown on line 0
appears when:

1)  use imap_open to connect
2) then use imap_search ALL to retrieve emails

but there are no messages available. To avoid this error, check first the
number of messages in a mailbox using imap_status. Only if there are messages
available then you can use the imap_search.
===============================================================================

imap_open()
validate SSL certificate does not support Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
certificate. It only validate against the Subject/Common name.
===============================================================================

If your opening and closing of connection is too slow, the issue might be with
DNS servers. You should add the IP addresses of IMAP servers to your hosts
file.

It's explained here in more details http://www.dejanstosic.com/
php-imap_open-too-slow-here-is-the-solution/
===============================================================================

To authenticate using kerberos V / GSSAPI, you might need to add "user=" to the
connection string.. eg:

$mbox = imap_open( "\{imap.example.com:143/imap/notls/user=" . $user . "}
INBOX", $user, $passwd );

Our IMAP servers won't allow a user other than the user specified in the
kerberos credentials connect using those credentials unless you specify that
extra "user=" in the connection string.  Passing it as an argument to imap_open
() doesn't seem to be enough.
===============================================================================

Thank you for this completely non-obvious tip, which solved the problem for me.
To help search engines find this tip: the resulting error is "PHP Warning: 
imap_open(): Couldn't open stream /home/your-directory/the-file-name in
the-script-name on line XX"

If you include:  $str = imap_errors();  echo("imap_errors():\n");  print_r
($str);
you will see:
  imap_errors():
  Array
  (
    [0] => Can't open mailbox /home/your-directory/the-file-name: no such
mailbox
  )
===============================================================================

If your connection is too slow, try it with port and without domain.

<?php
//Normal connection
$mailbox = imap_open("{SERVER}INBOX", $username, $password);

//Faster connection
$mailbox = imap_open("{SERVER:143}INBOX", $username, $password);

//Very slow connection
$mailbox = imap_open ("{SERVER.DOMAIN}INBOX", "DOMAIN/".$username, $password);
?>
===============================================================================

For FreeBSD users...

If you want to have SSL support, you want to install the ports:

mail/php5-imap
security/php5-openssl

Cheers :)

===============================================================================

a little tip for those who get really frustrated even after reading all the
right solutions and implementing them but still get the same errors or none at
all..:
after having changed the code.. restart the httpd deamon..

for Fedora or any other Red Hat Linux OS (/etc/init.d/httpd restart).

After this you will be able to make a imap/pop3 stream from apache..
===============================================================================

I can connect to my email server with no problem using regular usernames and
passwords but.... in my server the usernames are long.. like
name.surname1.surname2@subdomain.domain.com , and i get an error when the
username size is over 40 chars:

$conn = imap_open("{". $server . ":110/pop3}", $username, $user_password) or
die ("Failed with error: ".imap_last_error());

returns

Too many login failures

when the username is over 40 chars. Just remember that if you plan to use long
usernames.
===============================================================================

In order to make a IMAP connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, I used
this connection-string :

<?php
if(imap_open ("{192.168.1.6:143/imap}Inbox", "DOMAIN/USERNAME/ALIAS", 
"PASSWORD"))
{
    echo 'Connection success!';
}
else
{
    echo 'Connection failed';
}
?>

By replacing "Inbox" with, e.g. "Tasks", its possible to see all your tasks. I
Hope this helps anybody!

===============================================================================

Thanks for all your comments.  The user comments have saved me countless times.

I'd like to give back in my small way by providing this little tip.  To test
your pop or imap services you can use telnet (almost all operating systems
should come with a command line telnet client).

Here's the pop3 example (the lines that start with + are the server's
response):

    telnet your.pop.host.com 110
    +OK POP3 your.pop.host.com v2001.78 server ready
    user your_username
    +OK User name accepted, password please
    pass your_password
    +OK Mailbox open, 23 messages

Note that your pop server may be on some other port than 110 but that is the
default/standard.

Here's the imap example (Lines that have OK near the begining are server
responses):

    telnet your.imap.host.com 143
    * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1...]
    1 LOGIN "your_username" "your_password"
    1 OK [CAPABILITY...] ... User your_username authenticated

This might be old news to some people but I hope it's helpful for many.
===============================================================================

I had been having lots of trouble trying to get imap_open to connect to an imap
server.  Then I found another post online that suggested this and it worked, so
I am going to post it here.  I hope this helps others..

"I have tried with the following strings instead and it works:

for pop3: {www.server.com:110/pop3/notls}INBOX

and for imap: {www.server.com:143/notls}INBOX.
===============================================================================

<?php
// You can break out the variables for $mailserver, $port, $user and
// $pass without passing brackets into functions this way. Be sure to use
// the dots to append connection strings, ie "stuff". $variable ."STUFF"
// otherwise will go to imap_open with wrong variable type. :)

$mailserver="mail.example.com";
$port="110/pop3";
$user="aj";
$pass="remax01";
 
if ($mbox=imap_open( "{" . $mailserver . ":" . $port . "}INBOX", $user, $pass 
))
{  echo "Connected\n";
        
    $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
         
    echo "Date: "     . $check->Date    . "<br />\n" ;
    echo "Driver: "   . $check->Driver  . "<br />\n" ;
    echo "Unread: "   . $check->Unread  . "<br />\n" ;
    echo "Size: "     . $check->Size    . "<br />\n" ;
        
    imap_close($mbox);
} else { exit ("Can't connect: " . imap_last_error() ."\n");  echo "FAIL!\n"; 
};
?>
===============================================================================

Make sure your PHP is enabled with imap via the phpinfo() function

'--with-imap-dir=/opt/lampp' '--with-imap-ssl' '--with-imap=/opt/lampp'

and

IMAP c-Client Version 2007e
SSL Support Yes

I noticed that my apache script was working but my cli script was not. Turns
out my php cli executable didn't have imap setup so I had to use another php
cli executable.
===============================================================================

Dears.
In my case, e-mail host was the IMAP enabled.
So, just use the imap_open as the very simple form like:

$mailbox = "{mail.myhost.com:143/notls}INBOX";
$user = "me@myhost.com";
$pass = "mypassword";

$connection = imap_open($mailbox,$user,$pass) or die(imap_last_error()."<br>
Connection Faliure!");

thanks!
===============================================================================

Looking for a cool PHP Script to help you connect to a POP3 server, and
download E-Mail to MySQL? Check out my neet-skeet script I wrote. Have fun.

Http://www.sellchain.com/phPOP3/phPOP3.txt

Download the above TXT file, and rename it to phPOP3.php.

Trust me, you will learn mostly everything about IMAP with this script.

By the way, be sure to use print_r($headers) to discover the headers that come
with each message. You can setup your MySQL + Email Account information at the
top of the script. No includes required!

Enjoyz;)
===============================================================================

thanks to the one who added that the login part should be the whole email
address for it to work.. (assuming of course that all other stuff is good and
working ;)

to add something, in the 'email address' login name, is not really the email
address, ,it's the pop login name plus '@' plus the domain.. hope it's not
confusing...

poploginname@domain.com

not

emailaddress@domain.com..
===============================================================================

I've found that on my servers I _must_ use imap_errors() and imap_alerts()
after an imap_open or this error is thrown in the logs when the mailbox is
empty: [error] PHP Warning: (null)(); Mailbox is empty (errflg=1) in Unknown on
line 0
===============================================================================

I was getting bizzare errors that I couldn't find documentation about anywhere
on Google. I tried connecting to another server and got different, but just as
unusual error messages. I even checked the POP3 server logs and it said
something about invalid command... I figured it was another libc problem.

Stupidly enough, the problem was that I was using an unset variable for the
password! Make sure you don't have an empty username or password... you'll have
a hard time debugging the problem ;)
===============================================================================

Had problems to use imap_open with iMail 6.06 Server. My problem was (sounds
stupid): Didn't realise that the username had to be the full email address and
not just the login. Maybe this helps some people.
===============================================================================

hi
  Note for all having problems to connect hosts using imap_open:

  I spent almost week trying to fix my script which was connecting to localhost
but was unable to connect any other host. Sollution was actually wery simple
but I'm writing that note becouse there are some posts at usenet or forums
decribing similiar problems. And actually I haven't found any  answer for that.
So for all of you trying to connect to hosts with imap_open CHECK IF THERE IS
NO FIREWALL BLOCKING POP3.

I just want to say to all redhat people who have problem (Couldn't open stream)
with the connection on the local pop server to use this :
{127.0.0.1:110/pop3/notls}INBOX
hope this help
===============================================================================

It would be nice to mention that this function does send headers. It makes
sense, but it is not obvious. It took me a while to figure it out. I
authenticate against a POP3 server, and set a cookie if the authentication
validates. At least I wanted to :) But since it sends a header to the server,
setcookie() won't work.
===============================================================================

I have found that the syntax for the imap_open command in PHP 4 differs whether
you're passing a variable to the imap_open function or declaring the host
directly within the function.  If you are passing variables to the imap_open
function, the syntax should look like:

$username = "user";
$password = "password";
$mailserver = "mail.somedomina.com:110/imap";

$link = imap_open("\{$mailserver}INBOX",$username,$password);

If you don't include the leading backslash (\) you will not open the stream. 
Likewise you cannot pass the curly braces to the function.

If you define the server directly, omit the leading backslash.

$username = "user";
$password = "password";

$link = imap_open("{mail.somedomain.com:110/pop3}",$username,$password)"

I discovered all of this after 3 days of trying to get all of this work on
redhat 7.1.
===============================================================================

A better way to connect to a mail server would be to use uri syntax, for
example:

imap://username:password@server.com:143/INBOX/message/part

this is very easy to parse using 'parse_url()'

Remember to keep your username and password hidden if your over an open network
===============================================================================

IMAP, POP and NNTP are ok. But plaintext mailboxes are unmentioned here. You
just forget the {part} and go for the file (tested on unix):

$mbox = imap_open ($a_mail_box_file_name_in_home_dir, "", "") || die("Snif...:
".imap_last_error());
===============================================================================

Connections to the IMAP server work without specifying the port number, but
they are slow, so specifying the port number is important if you don't want a
slow application.
===============================================================================

I have a single comment to add about imap_open.
If you want to connect to a news server, without specifying any news gruop, you
can use the following:

<?php
$server = "{news.servername.com/nntp:119}";
$nntp = imap_open($server,"","",OP_HALFOPEN);
?>

and $nntp will become the connection ID.

I was trying imap_open() function but I was continuously getting this error:

Array ( [0] => [CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server response) )

I was finally able to solve this problem (which is a very common problem as I
saw it on the net but could not find any solution to it) so I'm posting my
solution here which I hope will be useful to others.

I used stunnel program (http://www.stunnel.org/) and made changes in the
stunnel.conf file as follows:

I added these lines:
[imapsClient]
accept = localhost:143
connect  = imapserver:993
client = yes
sslVersion = TLSv1

This will map insecure imap connection from localhost:143 to imapserver:993
(IMAP with SSL).

After this I tried this code and it worked fine:

<?php

$user="";
$pass="";
$imap = @imap_open("{localhost:143}INBOX", $user, $pass);
?>

and I was able to do away with the errors.

A more detailed post about it can be found here:

Setting a mailbox name (eg INBOX) at the end of the connection string does not
work when using imap_open() with OP_HALFOPEN. You may use imap_reopen() then.

<?php

/* this will fail : */
$connection = imap_open('{mx.example.net}INBOX', 'foo', 'secret', OP_HALFOPEN
.);
$num_mgs = imap_num_msg($connection);
imap_close($connection);

/* this will do : */
$connection = imap_open('{mx.example.net}INBOX', 'foo', 'secret', OP_HALFOPEN
.);
imap_reopen($connection, '{mx.example.net}INBOX');
$num_mgs = imap_num_msg($connection);
imap_close($connection);

?>
===============================================================================

Warning: imap_open() [function.imap-open]: Couldn't open stream
{xx.xx.x.xxx:143}INBOX

correct the connection string as :
{xx.xx.x.xxx:143/notls}INBOX
===============================================================================

pop3 seems to like refusing connection if you have OP_READONLY set

testers: be forewarned :P
===============================================================================

If you are accessing a local mailbox file, i.e. imap_open('/var/mail/www-data',
'', ''), you may be restricted in what files you can access.

If PHP IMAP was compiled with the restrictBox option (which I believe most
packages are these days), you can only access files relative to $HOME. Paths
starting with '/' or '../' will be rejected.
===============================================================================

For those having issues with Gmail (my problem was : "too many login failures"
on a webserver, but no problem on localhost..), instead of opening with :

$inbox = imap_open($hostname,$username,$password,NULL,1) or die('Cannot connect
to Gmail: ' . imap_last_error());

Use :

$inbox = imap_open($hostname,$username,$password,NULL,1) or die('Cannot connect
to Gmail: ' . print_r(imap_errors()));

You will be able to see the full list of errors that happened, and hopefully it
will guide you to an answer.
In my case, Google wanted me to unlock my account by typing in a captcha. But
this error wasn't clearly shown through imap_last_error().

"notls" seems to be required for PHP on RedHat 8.0, but it seems that "/norsh"
is also advisable; without it, the client library will attempt an RSH
connection and wait for this to timeout before reverting to normal IMAP. This
was causing a 15 second delay in imap_open for me. Looking at the client lib C
code this will likely be an issue on other platforms as well as they update to
the newer version. You can use both "/notls" and "/norsh", e.g. the first
parameter to imap_open can be something like: "{your.imap.host/imap/notls/
norsh}".
===============================================================================

WHen you use the /ssl connection...  half open doesnt work...!

what i did was opened it up with the .com:143/pop3}, op_halfopen

when i was getting my folders...
===============================================================================

if u ever get something like this:

Notice: Unknown: IMAP protocol error: Invalid system flag in Store command
(errflg=2) in Unknown on line 0

Notice: Unknown: Invalid system flag in Store command (errflg=2) in Unknown on
line 0

This Error occurs if u want to set a flag 2 times. Just check ur manually flag
Settings.

Works with Gmail's new IMAP function for personal and for Google Apps.

$mbox = imap_open ("{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX", "username@gmail.com",
"password")
     or die("can't connect: " . imap_last_error());
===============================================================================

To open local mailbox ( mbox ) enter its absolute file name.

>an absolute filename
>This specifies a mailbox in the default format (usually >Berkeley format for
most default library builds)

===============================================================================

Note about "PHP Warning:  Certificate failure"

I'm not sure if this is a RedHat, PHP, or IMAP library issue, but the default
for SSL seems to have changed.

You now need to specify "/notls" when you don't want TLS, rather than only
needing to specify "/ssl" when you do.

Example: 

"{localhost:143}INBOX"

becomes:

"{localhost:143/notls}INBOX"
===============================================================================

Beginning with 5.2.2, binaries built for Windows also seem to have changed its
default behavior.
'/notls' needs to be specified for a non-SSL connection.
===============================================================================

you can avoid this message :

Warning: (null)(); Mailbox is empty (errflg=1) in Unknown on line 0

by specified the option OP_SILENT to imap_open.
===============================================================================

I only run imap on port 993 (ssl only) and I was unable to use imap_open()..
couldn't even get an error out of the script, it just sat there and timed out
with no messages in the logs or anything--the page wouldn't load.

Anyway, this is what finally worked, which I found in the readme for a popular
opensource webmail system:

$i = @imap_open("{localhost:993/ssl/novalidate-cert}INBOX", $user, $pw);

I didn't see the 'ssl' option mentioned anywhere in these comments so maybe
this will help someone out.

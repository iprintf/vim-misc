返回值

Array with the opened archive's signature in hash key and MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256,
SHA-512, or OpenSSL in hash_type. This signature is a hash calculated on the
entire phar's contents, and may be used to verify the integrity of the archive.
A valid signature is absolutely required of all executable phar archives if the
phar.require_hash INI variable is set to true.

To get the memory usage in KB or MB

<?php
function convert($size)
{
    $unit=array('b','kb','mb','gb','tb','pb');
    return @round($size/pow(1024,($i=floor(log($size,1024)))),2).' '.$unit[$i];
}

echo convert(memory_get_usage(true)); // 123 kb
?>
===============================================================================

To get the memory usage in KB or MB

<?php
    function echo_memory_usage() {
        $mem_usage = memory_get_usage(true);
       
        if ($mem_usage < 1024)
            echo $mem_usage." bytes";
        elseif ($mem_usage < 1048576)
            echo round($mem_usage/1024,2)." kilobytes";
        else
            echo round($mem_usage/1048576,2)." megabytes";
           
        echo "<br/>";
    }
?>
===============================================================================

Note, that the official IEC-prefix for kilobyte, megabyte and so on are KiB,
MiB, TiB and so on.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebibyte

At first glance this may sound like "What the hell? Everybody knows, that we
mean 1024 not 1000 and the difference is not too big, so what?". But in about
10 years, the size of harddisks (and files on them) reaches the petabyte-limit
and then the difference between PB and PiB is magnificent.

Better to get used to it now. :)

[EDIT by danbrown AT php DOT net: This is intended by the author to only be
used with PHP 4 < 4.3.2.]

I'd just like to point out that although sandeepc at myrealbox dot com's idea
for displaying the current memory usage is a good one, it's perhaps a bad idea
to pipe the entire process list through grep. A better performing method would
be to select only the process we're interested in:

<?php
$pid = getmypid();
error_log('MEMORY USAGE (% KB PID ): ' . `ps --pid $pid --no-headers
-o%mem,rss,pid`);
?>

True, it's not much of a performance boost, but every bit helps.
===============================================================================

The method sandeepc at myrealbox dot com posted yields larger memory usage, my
guess is that it includes all the PHP interpreter/internal code and not just
the script being run.

1) Use ps command
MEMORY USAGE (% KB PID ):  0.8 12588 25087 -> about 12MB
2) Use memory_get_usage()
int(6041952) -> about 6MB
===============================================================================

Sometimes, we need all memory to run our task, we do ini_set('memory_limit', 
-1 ), or maximum value we have.

To avoid stuck of server on long and memory consuming tasks, i wrote this
check. This is not the same as memory_get_usage() do, but more. It shows
virtual memory amount, taken by your process. In percents.

<?php
    function getVirtualMemoryTaken()
    {
        $pid = getmypid();
        $a = `ps -p $pid v | awk 'END{print $9}'`;
        return $a*1;
    }
?>

It works only in linux, tested in Ubuntu 14.

<?php
    $a = ' ';
    do {  $a .= $a . $a; }
    while (getVirtualMemoryTaken() < 20 );
?>
===============================================================================

I can confirm that this function triggers a garbage collection. I have a script
that exceeded 128MB of memory at some point and ended with a fatal error. I was
confused, because the script dealt with some large files initially, but the
memory load from that point on should have been marginal, and the error
occurred at the very end.

Those large files were dealt in a dedicated function and i even used unset() on
the variable holding the file after the file was written to disk inside that
function. So the memory should have been cleared twice, first after the unset()
call, and second once the function ended.

To debug the memory usage, I called memory_get_usage(true) at some points and
echo-ed the memory allocation. Just by adding a few echos here and there in the
script, the memory usage never exceeded 1MB overhead (on top of the current
file size) and the memory error disappeared.
===============================================================================

not sure how this works internally but I have observed sort of side effects
here: calling this function apparently triggers PHP's "garbage collector" --
and frees some memory. I managed to "fix" some savagely coded mess of a web
application solely by calling this function just before the code that would
usually throw out-of-memory errors. the php version there was 5.2.10
===============================================================================

The Win XP / 2003 workaround script will also work with windows 2000 with a few
slight modifications.

Please note that you'll need the pslist.exe utility from http://
www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsTools.html because win/2000 itself does not
provide a task list utility.

<?php

function getMemUsage()
{
    
       if (function_exists('memory_get_usage'))
       {
           return memory_get_usage();
       }
       else if ( substr(PHP_OS,0,3) == 'WIN')
       {
           // Windows 2000 workaround

           $output = array();
           exec('pslist ' . getmypid() , $output);
           return trim(substr($output[8],38,10));
       }
       else
       {
           return '<b style="color: red;">no value</b>';
       }
}
?>
===============================================================================

This is a function that should work for both Windows XP/2003 and most
distrabutions of UNIX and Mac OS X.

<?php
if( !function_exists('memory_get_usage') )
{
    function memory_get_usage()
    {
        //If its Windows
        //Tested on Win XP Pro SP2. Should work on Win 2003 Server too
        //Doesn't work for 2000
        //If you need it to work for 2000 look at http://us2.php.net/manual/en/
function.memory-get-usage.php#54642
        if ( substr(PHP_OS,0,3) == 'WIN')
        {
               if ( substr( PHP_OS, 0, 3 ) == 'WIN' )
                {
                    $output = array();
                    exec( 'tasklist /FI "PID eq ' . getmypid() . '" /FO LIST', 
$output );
       
                    return preg_replace( '/[\D]/', '', $output[5] ) * 1024;
                }
        }else
        {
            //We now assume the OS is UNIX
            //Tested on Mac OS X 10.4.6 and Linux Red Hat Enterprise 4
            //This should work on most UNIX systems
            $pid = getmypid();
            exec("ps -eo%mem,rss,pid | grep $pid", $output);
            $output = explode("  ", $output[0]);
            //rss is given in 1024 byte units
            return $output[1] * 1024;
        }
    }
}
?>

If nothing else in the user notes below works for you, you can get a very
(VERY) rough estimate of PHP memory usage by outputting the $GLOBALS array,
stripping it of indentation whitespace, and counting the characters in the
resulting string.  This method has a very high overhead (to be expected), but
works on all operating systems, regardless of whether or not they have the
--enable-memory-limit config option set.  I find that the syntax overhead of
the print_r() statement roughly accounts for the PHP runtime base memory usage.

The code below is set up to work on all arrays, not just the $GLOBALS array. 
Keep in mind that outside data referenced by resource IDs, such as database
results and open file data, is not included in this total.

<?php

function array_size($arr) {
  ob_start();
  print_r($arr);
  $mem = ob_get_contents();
  ob_end_clean();
  $mem = preg_replace("/\n +/", "", $mem);
  $mem = strlen($mem);
  return $mem;
}

$memEstimate = array_size($GLOBALS);

?>

Use only if being off to either side by at least 20% is acceptible for your
purposes.
===============================================================================

[EDIT by danbrown AT php DOT net: This function will only extend Windows
versions of PHP where the server has the required third-party software.]

I was unable to get the previous examples working properly and created code
which works at least for me. Enjoy!

<?php
// Please note that you'll need the pslist.exe utility from http://
www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsTools.html
// This is because win/2000 itself does not provide a task list utility.
//
function getMemoryUsage() {

// try to use PHP build in function
if( function_exists('memory_get_usage') ) {
  return memory_get_usage();
}

// Try to get Windows memory usage via pslist command
if ( substr(PHP_OS,0,3) == 'WIN') {
 
  $resultRow = 8;
  $resultRowItemStartPosition = 34;
  $resultRowItemLength = 8;
 
  $output = array();
  exec('pslist -m ' . getmypid() , $output);
   
  return trim(substr($output[$resultRow], $resultRowItemStartPosition, 
$resultRowItemLength)) . ' KB';
 
}


// No memory functionality available at all
return '<b style="color: red;">no value</b>';
 
}
?>
===============================================================================

When you need to get the OS, do not use $_SERVER['OS'] or $_ENV['OS'], better
use PHP_OS constant !
<?php
if (substr(PHP_OS,0,3)=='WIN') {
  // [...]
}
?>

You also have other values such as CYGWIN_NT-5.0, Linux, ... this is the best
way to get system's os (anyone on linux can do an "export OS=windows")
===============================================================================

Decision a memory_get_usage problem for windows system

Tested OS: Windows XP
Server: Apache

PHP must be loaded as CGI to get correctly memory usage by Process ID (
getmypid() ) and with cmd-tools like tasklist.exe

PHP as CGI have your own PID instead constant Apache PID and you get a true
memory size independed form Apache memory usage.

Configure in httpd.conf of Apache:

1. Comment the line like this:
LoadModule php4_module "/usr/local/php/sapi/php4apache.dll"
or
LoadModule php5_module "/usr/local/php5/php5apache.dll"

2. Add this and edit your path to php:
<Directory "z:/usr/local/php">
  Options ExecCGI
</Directory>
ScriptAlias "/__php_dir__/" "z:/usr/local/php/"
Action application/x-httpd-php "/__php_dir__/php.exe"

3. Restart Apache

Use this PHP-code:

<?php
/**
* A memory_get_usage() for Windows System, wich compiled without
--enable-memory-limit
* PHP must be loaded as CGI
* Greetings form miteigi nemoto
* @return string
*/
function memory_get_usage_by_tasklist()
{
    $output = array();
    exec( 'tasklist ', $output );
    foreach ($output as $value)
    {
        $ex=explode(" ",$value);
        $count_ex=count($ex);
        if (eregi(" ".getmypid()." Console",$value))
        {
            $memory_size=$ex[$count_ex-2]." Kb";
            return $memory_size;
        }
    }
}
echo memory_get_usage_by_tasklist();
?>
===============================================================================

the various memory_get_usage replacements here don't seem to work on Mac OS X
10.4(Intel)

I got it to work like this...

<?php
function memory_get_usage()
{
     $pid = getmypid();
     exec("ps -o rss -p $pid", $output);
     return $output[1] *1024;
}
?>

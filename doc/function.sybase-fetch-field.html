Bit short on comments and tips bout this one so head down to mysql_fetch_fields
where the concept is the same. I seemed to get an infinite loop over there
using the $i counter tho, so I used a for loop instead.
The list of properties you can get from what I've called $info is in the
example to the mysql equivalent.

//start of an example to print out column headings

echo "<table><tr>";
  $numfields=sybase_num_fields($query);
  for ($f=0;$f<=$numfields;$f++){
    $info = sybase_fetch_field($query);
    echo "<td> $info->name </td>";
  }
  echo "</tr><tr>";

The 'type' field contains (roughly) the datatype of the source column.  Types
returned are:

  'type'   Sybase Type
  -------  --------------------------
  string   CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT
  image    IMAGE
  blob     BINARY, VARBINARY
  bit      BIT
  int      TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT
  real     REAL, FLOAT, NUMERIC, DECIMAL
  money    MONEY
  datetime DATETIME, SMALLDATETIME

SoapClient::__doRequest — Performs a SOAP request

说明

public string SoapClient::__doRequest ( string $request , string $location , 
string $action , int $version [, int $one_way = 0 ] )

Performs SOAP request over HTTP.

This method can be overridden in subclasses to implement different transport
layers, perform additional XML processing or other purpose.

参数

request

    The XML SOAP request.

location

    The URL to request.

action

    The SOAP action.

version

    The SOAP version.

one_way

    If one_way is set to 1, this method returns nothing. Use this where a
    response is not expected.

返回值

The XML SOAP response.

更新日志

版本                说明
5.1.3 The one_way parameter was added.

Note when extending __doRequest, calling __getLastRequest will probably report
incorrect information unless you make sure to update the internal
__last_request variable. Save yourself some headaches.

function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version) {
      $request = preg_replace('/abc/', 'def', $request);
      $ret = parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
      $this->__last_request = $request;
      return $ret;
}
===============================================================================

If you want to communicate with a default configured ASP.NET server with SOAP
1.1 support, override your __doRequest with the following code. Adjust the
namespace parameter, and all is good to go.

<?php
class MSSoapClient extends SoapClient {

    function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version) {
        $namespace = "http://tempuri.com";

        $request = preg_replace('/<ns1:(\w+)/', '<$1 xmlns="'.$namespace.'"', 
$request, 1);
        $request = preg_replace('/<ns1:(\w+)/', '<$1', $request);
        $request = str_replace(array('/ns1:', 'xmlns:ns1="'.$namespace.'"'),
array('/', ''), $request);

        // parent call
        return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
    }
}

$client = new MSSoapClient(...);
?>

Hope this will save people endless hours of fiddling...
===============================================================================

If you happen to get an error during your request which says "SOAP-ERROR:
Encoding: Can't decode apache map, only Strings or Longs are allowd as keys",
the reason seems to be the response xml using integer for keys and php failling
to understand them

Here is something that worked for me (converts integer keys to strings):

<?php
class mySoap extends SoapClient
{
    public function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version)
    {
        $result = parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
        $result = str_replace('<key xsi:type="xsd:int">', '<key xsi:type=
"xsd:string">', $result);
        return $result;
    }
}

// $soap = new mySoap(...
?>
===============================================================================

Note that __getLastRequest() data are buffered _before_ the call to __doRequest
().  Thus any modifications you make to the XML while in __doRequest() will not
be visible in the output of __getLastRequest().   This is so in at least v5.2.0
===============================================================================

Note that the SoapClient.__doRequest() method circumvents the throwing of
SoapFault exceptions.

Specifically, if you call the __doRequest() method and it fails, it would
normally throw a SoapFault exception.  However, the __doRequest() method
doesn't actually throw the exception. Instead, the exception is saved in a
class attribute called SoapFault.__soap_fault, and is actually thrown AFTER the
__doRequest method completes (but the call stack will show that the exception
was created inside the __doRequest method.

I successfully used the following code to query the locally cached exception
object that was not thrown:

<?php
$exception = null;
try {
    $result = parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, 
$one_way);
}
catch (SoapFault $sf) {
    //this code was not reached   
    $exception = $sf;
}
catch (Exception $e) {
    //nor was this code reached either
    $exception = $e;
}
if((isset($this->__soap_fault)) && ($this->__soap_fault != null)) {
    //this is where the exception from __doRequest is stored
    $exception = $this->__soap_fault;
}

//decide what to do about the exception here
// [enter code here]
//or throw the exception
if($exception != null) {
    throw $exception;
}
//note: you may want to unset the __soap_fault value if you don't want it
thrown again up the call stack
?>
===============================================================================

I was needing to add a blank soap header (<SOAP-ENV:Header /> and found no
other place that has done this.  The only way I was able to support this was to
extend SoapClient and re-define __doRequest.  Hope this helps someone or if
there is support for this in the library, please point me in the right
direction:

<?php
class MySoapCli extends SoapClient {
  function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version) {
    $dom = new DomDocument('1.0', 'UTF-8');
    $dom->preserveWhiteSpace = false;
    $dom->loadXML($request);
    $hdr = $dom->createElementNS('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/', 
'SOAP-ENV:Header');
    $dom->documentElement->insertBefore($hdr, $dom->documentElement->firstChild
);
    $request = $dom->saveXML();
    return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Beware of PHP incosistent behaviour in __doRequest() method. It seems that some
arguments passed to this method are passed by reference!

If you try to create your own __doRequest() method and store it's arguments as
SoapClient properties you will find that after __soapCall all of them will be
null or unknown.

<?php
    protected $__soapAction = '';

    public function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $oneWay
= 0) {
        ob_start();
        $this->server->handle($request);
        $response = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        $this->__soapAction = $action;
        return $response;
    }
?>

In above example $this->__soapAction will be null after $obj->__soapCall()..

To store $action value, you must cast it to a string (so PHP will be forced to
create a new variable with different memory pointer):

<?php
    public function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $oneWay
= 0) {
        ob_start();
        $this->server->handle($request);
        $response = ob_get_contents();
        ob_end_clean();
        $this->__soapAction = (string)$action;
        return $response;
    }
?>
===============================================================================

Do you have problems with the PHP5 SoapClient when you need to send a request
to a service with a ComplexType parameter?

Maybe because my service is build in Delphi with REMObjects SDK 3.0 I had the
problems, maybe not. Anyway, this was my remedy:
<?php
$versie = new stdClass();//define a basic class object
$versie->versieID = $aVersie->versieID();//fill it with the exact attributes as
your complextype Object in the wsdl is
$versie->versieNummer = $aVersie->versieNummer();
$versie->isActief = $aVersie->isActief();     
    
$soapVersieType = new SoapVar($versie , SOAP_ENC_OBJECT, "Versie", "http://
127.0.0.1:8999/SOAP?wsdl"); //create the complex soap type, Versie is the name
of my complex type in the wsdl, the latter url beeing the location of my wsdl.

try{
  $result =  $soapClient->BewaarVersie($this->sessieId,$soapVersieType); //
BewaarVersie is a function derived from my WSDL with two params.
}
catch(SoapFault $e){
  trigger_error('Something soapy went wrong: '.$e->faultstring,E_USER_WARNING);
            }
?>

After some more testing i found out that the conversion to the StdClass()
object was not required. My 'Versie' local object has the attributes for the
'Versie' wsdl complex type defined as private vars and give no pain when i
create the SoapVar with an instance of the local 'Versie' Object.

Change Blocking mode for Socket stream and set Timeout for Soap requests

<?php

class TimeoutSoapClient extends SoapClient
{
    const TIMEOUT = 20;
    public function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, 
$one_way = 0)
    {
        $url_parts = parse_url($location);
        $host = $url_parts['host'];
        $http_req = 'POST '.$location.' HTTP/1.0'."\r\n";
        $http_req .= 'Host: '.$host."\r\n";
        $http_req .= 'SoapAction: '.$action."\r\n";
        $http_req .= "\r\n";
        $http_req .= $request;
        $port = 80;
        if ($url_parts['scheme'] == 'https')
        {
            $port = 443;
            $host = 'ssl://'.$host;
        }
        $socket = fsockopen($host, $port);
        fwrite($socket, $request);
        stream_set_blocking($socket, false);
        $response = '';
        $stop = microtime(true) + self::TIMEOUT;
        while (!feof($socket))
        {
            $response .= fread($socket, 2000);
            if (microtime(true) > $stop)
            {
                throw new SoapFault('Client', 'HTTP timeout');
            }
        }
        return $response;
    }
}
===============================================================================

You can use this method to correct the SOAP request before sending it, if
necessary. You can use the DOM API to accomplish that.

<?php

public ExtendedClient extends SoapClient {

   function __construct($wsdl, $options = null) {
      parent::__construct($wsdl, $options);
   }

   function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version) {
      $dom = new DOMDocument('1.0');

      try {

         //loads the SOAP request to the Document
         $dom->loadXML($request);

      } catch (DOMException $e) {
         die('Parse error with code ' . $e->code);
      }

      //create a XPath object to query the request
      $path = new DOMXPath($dom);

      //search for a node
      $nodesToFix = $path->query('//SOAP-ENV:Envelope/SOAP-ENV:Body/path/to/
node');

      //check if nodes are ok
      $this->checkNodes($path, $nodesToFix);

      //save the modified SOAP request
      $request = $dom->saveXML();
     
      //doRequest
      return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
   }

   function checkNodes(DOMXPath $path, DOMNodeList $nodes) {
      //iterate through the node list
      for ($i = 0; $ < $nodes->length; $i++) {
         $aNode = $nodes->item($i);

         //just an example
         if ($node->nodeValue == null) {
            //do something. For instance, let's remove it.
            $node->parentNode->removeChild($node);
         }
      }
   }
}
?>

This gives the developer the chance to solve interoperability problems with a
web service.
===============================================================================

If your application interacts with SOAP services and you wish to cache the
responses for consumption later, then overriding SoapClient::__doRequest is the
way to go.

For instance, if you know that the information presented doesn't change that
often and you don't want to do a superfluous HTTP request, you can grab a
response from a local cache and let SoapClient do the transformation to PHP
data types.

<?php
class YourNamespace_SoapClient_Local extends SoapClient {
    protected $cacheDocument = "";
    public function __construct($wsdl, $options) {
        parent::__construct($wsdl, $options);
    }

    /**
     * SetCacheDocument() sets the previously cached document contents
     */
    public function SetCacheDocument($document) {
        $this->cacheDocument = $document;
    }

    /**
     * __doRequest() overrides the standard SoapClient to handle a local
request
     */
    public function __doRequest() {
        return $this->cacheDocument;
    }
}

//---- code snippet showing usage within a class
//$document is a cached SOAP response document from a previous request, saved
with SoapClient::__getLastResponse() to some cache somewhere
//for the purpose of this example, it is assumed that $this->wsdl, $this->
options, $this->method and $this->params are set.

public function SoapRequest($document) {
    $method = $this->method;
    if($document == "") {
        //uncached
        try {
            //default options
            $client = new SoapClient($this->wsdl, $this->options);
            $result = $client->$method($this->params);
            //send the response to the cache
            $this->CacheResponse($client->__getLastResponse());
        } catch(SoapFault $fault) {
            //log something
            return FALSE;
        }
    } else {
        //cached document
        try {
            /**
             * the WSDL needs to be set to allow the method to be called on the
client object
             * and to trigger SoapClient to decode the response to native data
types
             */
            $client = new YourNamespace_SoapClient_Local($this->wsdl, $this->
options);
            $client->SetCacheDocument($document);
            $result = $client->$method($this->params);
        } catch (SoapFault $fault) {
            //log something
            return FALSE;
        }
    }
    return $result;
}
?>

I'll leave you to work out the caching, plenty of options there.. ;)
===============================================================================

I just wanted to note in plain english how to build up this request, because I
made some assumptions by just misterpreting the parameters.

This is for future reference(for myself) and others that might end up a bit
mistified by just not understanding the finesses of soap and are trying to
learn.

    $this->__doRequest(string $request , string $location , string $action ,
int $version [, int $one_way = 0 ] );

$request = The XML Soap enveloppe
$location = The url to the WSDL file. No matter that you defined this before
when setting up the object, you need to reuse it here.
$action = the soap action to be performed. This is defined in the wsdl file and
can be in the form of a single form or an url. it's just a parameter and might
not be an actual valid url
$version = SOAP_1_1 =  content headers (Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8␍)
                  SOAP_1_2 = content headers (Content-Type: application/
soap+xml; charset=utf-8; action="somesoapaction defined in $action")

If you send a SOAP_1_2 request to a SOAP_1_1 server you might get a reply in
the following form

    HTTP/1.1 415 Cannot process the message because the content type
'application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8; action="somesoapaction defined in
$action"' was not the expected type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'.

You need to switch down to SOAP_1_1 in that case to get the proper formatting
the server can understand
===============================================================================

If you're having trouble connecting to an authenticated SOAP service there's
something important to note here.

__doRequest() is only used when a SOAPClient function is called, NOT when the
WSDL if fetched and parsed.  That means if your WSDL file is not publicly
accessible but also resides behind your authentication it won't be accessible
by default.  Instead you'll have to create an overloaded stream wrapper and
register it for whatever protocol (probably HTTP) you'll be using.

gzpassthru

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

gzpassthru — Output all remaining data on a gz-file pointer

说明

int gzpassthru ( resource $zp )

Reads to EOF on the given gz-file pointer from the current position and writes
the (uncompressed) results to standard output.

    Note:

    You may need to call gzrewind() to reset the file pointer to the beginning
    of the file if you have already written data to it.

Tip

If you just want to dump the contents of a file to the output buffer, without
first modifying it or seeking to a particular offset, you may want to use the 
readgzfile() function, which saves you the gzopen() call.

参数

zp

    The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
    successfully opened by gzopen().

返回值

The number of uncompressed characters read from gz and passed through to the
input, or FALSE on error.

范例

stream_socket_server — Create an Internet or Unix domain server socket

说明

resource stream_socket_server ( string $local_socket [, int &$errno [, string &
$errstr [, int $flags = STREAM_SERVER_BIND | STREAM_SERVER_LISTEN [, resource
$context ]]]] )

Creates a stream or datagram socket on the specified local_socket.

This function only creates a socket, to begin accepting connections use 
stream_socket_accept().

参数

local_socket

    The type of socket created is determined by the transport specified using
    standard URL formatting: transport://target.

    For Internet Domain sockets (AF_INET) such as TCP and UDP, the target
    portion of the remote_socket parameter should consist of a hostname or IP
    address followed by a colon and a port number. For Unix domain sockets, the
    target portion should point to the socket file on the filesystem.

    Depending on the environment, Unix domain sockets may not be available. A
    list of available transports can be retrieved using stream_get_transports()
    . See 所支持的套接字传输器（Socket Transports）列表 for a list of bulitin
    transports.

errno

    If the optional errno and errstr arguments are present they will be set to
    indicate the actual system level error that occurred in the system-level
    socket(), bind(), and listen() calls. If the value returned in errno is 0
    and the function returned FALSE, it is an indication that the error
    occurred before the bind() call. This is most likely due to a problem
    initializing the socket. Note that the errno and errstr arguments will
    always be passed by reference.

errstr

    See errno description.

flags

    A bitmask field which may be set to any combination of socket creation
    flags.

        Note:

        For UDP sockets, you must use STREAM_SERVER_BIND as the flags
        parameter.

context

返回值

Returns the created stream, or FALSE on error.

范例

Example #1 Using TCP server sockets

<?php
$socket = stream_socket_server("tcp://0.0.0.0:8000", $errno, $errstr);
if (!$socket) {
  echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
} else {
  while ($conn = stream_socket_accept($socket)) {
    fwrite($conn, 'The local time is ' . date('n/j/Y g:i a') . "\n");
    fclose($conn);
  }
  fclose($socket);
}
?>

The example below shows how to act as a time server which can respond to time
queries as shown in an example on stream_socket_client().


    Note: Most systems require root access to create a server socket on a port
    below 1024.

Example #2 Using UDP server sockets

<?php
$socket = stream_socket_server("udp://127.0.0.1:1113", $errno, $errstr, 
STREAM_SERVER_BIND);
if (!$socket) {
    die("$errstr ($errno)");
}

do {
    $pkt = stream_socket_recvfrom($socket, 1, 0, $peer);
    echo "$peer\n";
    stream_socket_sendto($socket, date("D M j H:i:s Y\r\n"), 0, $peer);
} while ($pkt !== false);

?>

注释

    Note: 当指定数值型的 IPv6 地址（例如 fe80::1）时必须用方括号将 IP 围起来——
    例如， tcp://[fe80::1]:80。

In some specialized scenarios, you may want to create an AF_INET socket (UDP or
TCP) but let the system select an unused port for you.  This is a standard
feature of internet sockets but it doesn't seem to be documented how to do this
for the stream_socket_server function.  It appears you can get this behavior by
selecting zero for the port number, for example, my test below printed
"127.0.0.1:4960".

<?php
  $sock = stream_socket_server("udp://127.0.0.1:0");
  $name = stream_socket_get_name($sock);
  echo $name;
?>

Using the OpenSSL extension, PHP can automatically generate self-signed SSL
certificates, which can be used for basic authentication and encryption
(although I would recommend to use a signed certificate instead) for SSL
servers.

I have extended the script by 'e at osterman dot com' to automatically create
self-signed certificates:

<?php
// Hello World! SSL HTTP Server.
// Tested on PHP 5.1.2-1+b1 (cli) (built: Mar 20 2006 04:17:24)

// Certificate data:
$dn = array(
    "countryName" => "UK",
    "stateOrProvinceName" => "Somerset",
    "localityName" => "Glastonbury",
    "organizationName" => "The Brain Room Limited",
    "organizationalUnitName" => "PHP Documentation Team",
    "commonName" => "Wez Furlong",
    "emailAddress" => "wez@example.com"
);

// Generate certificate
$privkey = openssl_pkey_new();
$cert    = openssl_csr_new($dn, $privkey);
$cert    = openssl_csr_sign($cert, null, $privkey, 365);

// Generate PEM file
# Optionally change the passphrase from 'comet' to whatever you want, or leave
it empty for no passphrase
$pem_passphrase = 'comet';
$pem = array();
openssl_x509_export($cert, $pem[0]);
openssl_pkey_export($privkey, $pem[1], $pem_passphrase);
$pem = implode($pem);

// Save PEM file
$pemfile = './server.pem';
file_put_contents($pemfile, $pem);

$context = stream_context_create();

// local_cert must be in PEM format
stream_context_set_option($context, 'ssl', 'local_cert', $pemfile);
// Pass Phrase (password) of private key
stream_context_set_option($context, 'ssl', 'passphrase', $pem_passphrase);

stream_context_set_option($context, 'ssl', 'allow_self_signed', true);
stream_context_set_option($context, 'ssl', 'verify_peer', false);

// Create the server socket
$server = stream_socket_server('ssl://0.0.0.0:9001', $errno, $errstr, 
STREAM_SERVER_BIND|STREAM_SERVER_LISTEN, $context);

while(true)
{
    $buffer = '';
    print "waiting...";
    $client = stream_socket_accept($server);
    print "accepted " . stream_socket_get_name( $client, true) . "\n";
    if( $client )
    {
        // Read until double CRLF
        while( !preg_match('/\r?\n\r?\n/', $buffer) )
            $buffer .= fread($client, 2046);
        // Respond to client
        fwrite($client,  "200 OK HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                         . "Connection: close\r\n"
                         . "Content-Type: text/html\r\n"
                         . "\r\n"
                         . "Hello World! " . microtime(true)
                         . "<pre>{$buffer}</pre>");
        fclose($client);
    } else {
        print "error.\n";
    }
}

?>

Just a small example how to use this function and also stream_select() to make
a server that accepts more than one connections (can have many clients
connected):
In master we hold all opened connections. Just before calling stream select we
copy the array to $read and then pass it ot stream_select(). In case that we
may read from at least one socket, $read will contain socket descriptors.
$master is needed not to lose references to the opened connections we have.
stream_server.php :
<?php

$master = array();
$socket = stream_socket_server("tcp://0.0.0.0:8000", $errno, $errstr);
if (!$socket) {
    echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
} else {
    $master[] = $socket;
    $read = $master;
    while (1) {
        $read = $master;
        $mod_fd = stream_select($read, $_w = NULL, $_e = NULL, 5);
        if ($mod_fd === FALSE) {
            break;
        }
        for ($i = 0; $i < $mod_fd; ++$i) {
            if ($read[$i] === $socket) {
                $conn = stream_socket_accept($socket);
                fwrite($conn, "Hello! The time is ".date("n/j/Y g:i a")."\n");
                $master[] = $conn;
            } else {
                $sock_data = fread($read[$i], 1024);
                var_dump($sock_data);
                if (strlen($sock_data) === 0) { // connection closed
                    $key_to_del = array_search($read[$i], $master, TRUE);
                    fclose($read[$i]);
                    unset($master[$key_to_del]);
                } else if ($sock_data === FALSE) {
                    echo "Something bad happened";
                    $key_to_del = array_search($read[$i], $master, TRUE);
                    unset($master[$key_to_del]);
                } else {
                    echo "The client has sent :"; var_dump($sock_data);
                    fwrite($read[$i], "You have sent :[".$sock_data."]\n");
                    fclose($read[$i]);
                     unset($master[array_search($read[$i], $master)]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
?>
stream_client.php:
<?php
$fp = stream_socket_client("tcp://127.0.0.1:8000", $errno, $errstr, 30);
if (!$fp) {
    echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
} else {
    fwrite($fp, "Aloha");
    while (!feof($fp)) {
        var_dump(fgets($fp, 1024));
    }
    fclose($fp);
}
?>

In the case of AF_UNIX sockets, note the named sockets that will be created
respects your umask(). So if you wanted your named socket to be writeable to
all, do umask(0) prior to calling stream_socket_server().

I'm writing an HTTP server and I need SSL support, but getting this to work
correctly with PHP streams took a bit of trial and error. For anyone who is
trying to get an HTTP SSL server working with stream_socket_server:

1) Your SSL context will need to contain 'local_cert'. If  you did not include
your private key with your local_cert, you'll also need to specify 'local_pk'
which is your RSA key.  Your keys and certs should be PEM encoded, which means
base-64. If your certificate has intermediary certs, you will need to specify
those in the correct order: Your signed cert, intermediary cert 1, intermediary
cert 2, etc. Each cert in the list needs to validate the one above it, but you
do not need to include the CA Root that your SSL signer provided; that should
already be included with the client's software (i.e. trust root certs).

You can append your private key in the file with your certs, however I keep
mine in its own file. If you see the word "encrypted" when you view your key
with a text viewer, you need to enter the correct passphrase and specify the
context "passphrase", otherwise you can leave that one out.

As a server, verify_peer is irrelevant and should be set to false (should
always be true if you are acting as an SSL client). Both cafile and capath
contexts are not needed for functioning as a SSL/TLS server, but they are
needed if you are making SSL connections with PHP as the client.

Lastly, the 'ciphers' context should be set to a list of secure ciphers. Search
for "mozilla recommended ciphers" and choose the string of ciphers that works
for you, because not all openssl supported ciphers are secure. I went with the
"intermediate" list, which provides high security and compatibility.

2) When you create the binding for stream_socket_server(), make sure that you
choose the tcp:// wrapper. DO NOT USE ssl:// or tls://. Anything other than
tcp:// will not work correctly AS A SERVER, those transports are what you use
when making connections with PHP as a client.

Remember that the encryption does not start until after an SSL handshake
completes, so the server has to listen in non-encrypted mode for new
connections, and encryption doesn't start until certs are exchanged and a
cipher is selected. When a new connection arrives you accept it with
stream_socket_accept() and then use stream_socket_enable_crypto() to start the
SSL session.

3) Keep in mind that the SSL handshake takes time, and that the stream_socket
wrappers are high level and not as responsive as the socket extension due to
the additional overhead they incur. For this reason you will need to enable
blocking for accepting new connections.

<enable blocking on ServerListenStream>
newConnStream = stream_socket_accept(ServerListenStream);
<disable blocking on ServerListenStream>

<enable blocking on newConnStream >
stream_socket_enable_crypto(newConnStream, true,
STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_SSLv23_SERVER);
<disable blocking on newConnStream >

Note that this is mainly for HTTP. If you are trying to do something like SMTP
then your script will have to react to the "starttls" command, but it would be
similar to the above except that you would wait for the "starttls" command
before invoking the  stream_socket_enable_crypto() function on the client's
stream.

TLS 1.0 is generally the way to go, SSLv3 is insecure and SSLv2 is buggy. If
you use the mozilla recommend cipher list in your context, you'll be fine. Hope
this helps someone out!

I had a horrible time trying to shove a TLS socket into an existing TCP
program.  It appears to me that functions like stream_socket_recvfrom and
stream_socket_sendto don't work with TLS/SSL (which may be obvious to PHP
gurus...sorry if it is, I'm in a bit over my head here).

In the end I ended up doing all my IO with fread() and fwrite(), which solved
all my problems.
===============================================================================

If you want a high speed socket server, use the low-level sockets instead
(socket_create/bind/listen). The stream_socket_server version appears to have
internal fixed 8k buffers that will overflow if you don't keep up by reading.

This is a serious problem if you an application that reads the socket for
messages and then, say, saves the result in a database. The delay while it is
busy processing means you can't read the data in time unless you get involved
in muti-threading.

With the the low-level functions, the OS quietly buffers TCP/IP packets so
there is no problem (tested on Windows XP Professional).
===============================================================================

You may have noticed that, unlike socket_listen, stream_socket_server doesn't
have a backlog parameter. From the source code of php 5.2.9, it looks like the
backlog parameter to the actual listen call is hardcoded to be 5. If this value
doesn't suit your needs, you'll have to use the lower-level socket functions.

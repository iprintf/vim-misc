(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

msql_fetch_row — Get row as enumerated array

说明

array msql_fetch_row ( resource $result )

msql_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the
specified query identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result column
is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.

Subsequent call to msql_fetch_row() would return the next row in the result
set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.

参数

result

    resource 型的结果集。此结果集来自对 msql_query() 的调用。

返回值

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

范例

Example #1 msql_fetch_row() example

<?php
$con = msql_connect();
if (!$con) {
    die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
}

if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
    die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
}

$result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
if (!$result) {
    die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
}

while ($row = msql_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo $row[0] . ': ' . $row[1] . "\n";
}

msql_free_result($result);
?>

===============================================================================

As an experienced programmer I recommend that new programmers do NOT use this
function.

Use mqsql_fetch_array instead.

Using this function leads to code like:

<?php

    $surname = $row[7];

?>

This is a dangerous coding practice and should be avoided.

Changing the original query can break existing code, often in subtle ways that
leave 'sleeper' bugs in your system that take months to appear.

Using mysql_fetch_array allows you to write code like:

<?php

    $surname = $data['surname'];

?>

This code will continue to run properly even columns are added to the originial
query.

Also it is much easier to read and makes reading and modiying your code easier,
reducing bugs.

Modification to the above code to make it work. Spelling Errors.

<?php
$con = mysql_connect();
if (!$con) {
   die('Server connection problem: ' . mysql_error());
}

if (!mysql_select_db('test', $con)) {
   die('Database connection problem: ' . mysql_error());
}

$result = mysql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
if (!$result) {
   die('Query execution problem: ' . mysql_error());
}

while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
   echo $row[0] . ': ' . $row[1] . "\n";
}

mysql_free_result($result);
?>

===============================================================================

If you would like to skip the update of recent messages use the OP_READONLY
flag when you open to check for new messages.
===============================================================================

The num_recent value does all the work it has to do. It returns only a number
if the mail is not touched any time before.
===============================================================================

Note that if you close your imap connexion, it seems that all the recents
messages are no more recents...
So it's not very useful for a webmail...
===============================================================================

If someone want to know number of unreaded messages just use
imap_mailboxmsginfo
===============================================================================

of course it doesnt. because "recent" does NOT mean "unseen" . they are
different. for Maildir users, recent means messages found in the "new" subdir
(which are moved to "cur" on the first opening of the Inbox). "unseen" are the
messages you guys probably want (messages which have never been read).

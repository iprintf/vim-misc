参数

name

    The name of the group

返回值

The array elements returned are:

                          The group information array
Element                               Description
        The name element contains the name of the group. This is a short,
name    usually less than 16 character "handle" of the group, not the real,
        full name. This should be the same as the name parameter used when
        calling the function, and hence redundant.
        The passwd element contains the group's password in an encrypted
passwd  format. Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords, an
        asterisk is returned instead.
gid     Group ID of the group in numeric form.
members This consists of an array of string's for all the members in the group.

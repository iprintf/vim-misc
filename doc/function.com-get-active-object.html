com_get_active_object

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

com_get_active_object — Returns a handle to an already running instance of a
COM object

说明

variant com_get_active_object ( string $progid [, int $code_page ] )

com_get_active_object() is similar to creating a new instance of a COM object,
except that it will only return an object to your script if the object is
already running. OLE applications use something known as the "Running Object
Table" to allow well-known applications to be launched only once; this function
exposes the COM library function GetActiveObject() to get a handle on a running
instance.

参数

progid

    progid must be either the ProgID or CLSID for the object that you want to
    access (for example Word.Application).

code_page

    Acts in precisely the same way that it does for the COM class.

返回值

If the requested object is running, it will be returned to your script just
like any other COM object.

错误／异常

There are a variety of reasons why this function might fail, the most common
being that the object is not already running. In that situation, the exception
error code will be MK_E_UNAVAILABLE; you can use the getCode method of the
exception object to check the exception code.

注释

Warning

Using com_get_active_object() in a web server context is not always a smart
idea. Most COM/OLE applications are not designed to handle more than one client
concurrently, even (or especially!) Microsoft Office. You should read
» Considerations for Server-Side Automation of Office for more information on
the general issues involved.

===============================================================================

Please note the next behavior (Apache 2.2.8, W2K, WXP)

If Apache runs as a service, com_get_active_object() always returns
MK_E_UNAVAILABLE, even when it is definitely sure that the Running Object Table
contains a reference to the required object.

If Apache runs in a console, com_get_active_object()  returns the object handle
as required.

This apparently is a Windows issue.

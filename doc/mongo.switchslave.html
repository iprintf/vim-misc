Mongo::switchSlave — Choose a new secondary for slaveOkay reads

说明

public string Mongo::switchSlave ( void )

This choses a random secondary for a connection to read from. It is called
automatically by the driver and should not need to be used. It calls 
MongoClient::getHosts() (to refresh the status of hosts) and Mongo::getSlave()
(to get the return value).

See the query section of this manual for information on distributing reads to
secondaries.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

The address of the secondary this connection is using for reads. This may be
the same as the previous address as addresses are randomly chosen. It may
return only one address if only one secondary (or only the primary) is
available.

For example, if we had a three member replica set with a primary, secondary,
and arbiter this method would always return the address of the secondary. If
the secondary became unavailable, this method would always return the address
of the primary. If the primary also became unavailable, this method would throw
an exception, as an arbiter cannot handle reads.

错误／异常

Throws a MongoException (error code 15) if it is called on a non-replica-set
connection. It will also throw MongoExceptions if it cannot find anyone
(primary or secondary) to read from (error code 16).

===============================================================================

It should be noted that using mysqli_stmt->insert_id will not result in a
unique ID being returned for each execution of a prepared insert statement.  In
practice, it appears that the first insertion ID is returned.  If you are
performing multiple inserts with the same prepared statement (one invocation of
mysqli_stmt::prepare and multiple invocations of mysqli_stmt::execute() for a
given statement), and need to keep the unique ID for each insert, use
mysqli_connection->insert_id.
===============================================================================

for those with zerofilled IDs beware as mysqli_stmt::$insert_id will return an
integer. In other words, if the ID returned from your query was #000099, the
value produced by mysqli_stmt::$insert_id is now #99.

I have not found a way to fix this beside using sprintf('%06d',$id) but this
assumes you know in advance the size of the ID beforehand.

pg_field_type_oid

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7)

pg_field_type_oid — Returns the type ID (OID) for the corresponding field
number

说明

int pg_field_type_oid ( resource $result , int $field_number )

pg_field_type_oid() returns an integer containing the OID of the base type of
the given field_number in the given PostgreSQL result resource.

You can get more information about the field type by querying PostgreSQL's
pg_type system table using the OID obtained with this function. The PostgreSQL 
format_type() function will convert a type OID into an SQL standard type name.

    Note:

    If the field uses a PostgreSQL domain (rather than a basic type), it is the
    OID of the domain's underlying type that is returned, rather than the OID
    of the domain itself.

参数

result

    PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by pg_query(), pg_query_params()
    or pg_execute() (among others).

field_number

    Field number, starting from 0.

返回值

The OID of the field's base type. FALSE is returned on error.

范例

Example #1 Getting information about fields

<?php
  $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");

  // Assume 'title' is a varchar type
  $res = pg_query($dbconn, "select title from authors where author = 'Orwell'"
);

  echo "Title field type OID: ", pg_field_type_oid($res, 0);
?>

以上例程会输出：

Title field type OID: 1043

===============================================================================

This function can be used to improve the performance of your application.
pg_field_type() makes an internal query to the pg_type table and it can be
really slow.
So if your application previously know the oids of your database, you can save
the execution time of this query in every request.

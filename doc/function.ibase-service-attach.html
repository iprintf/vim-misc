===============================================================================

The previous comment is incorrect. You can connect to the Service Manager as
any valid user, and connecting to the Service Manager is not the same as
connecting to the security database. However, some of the service functions
(which you may subsequently call with the service handle returned by
ibase_service_attach) are only available to SYSDBA.
===============================================================================

When using this function it looks like you can only use SYSDBA as the user, as
you are connecting to the security database. This is a restriction by the
interbase/firebird server.

An example of ibase_service_attach:
<?php
    //attach to the server running on localhost
    if (($service = ibase_service_attach('localhost', 'sysdba', 'masterkey')) !
= FALSE) {
        //retrieve server info
        $server_info  = ibase_server_info($service, IBASE_SVC_SERVER_VERSION)
                      . ' / '
                      . ibase_server_info($service, IBASE_SVC_IMPLEMENTATION);
        //detach from server (disconnect)
        ibase_service_detach($service);
    }
    else {
        $ib_error = ibase_errmsg();
    }
echo $server_info;
?>
Should echo something like:

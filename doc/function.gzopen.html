(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

gzopen — Open gz-file

说明

resource gzopen ( string $filename , string $mode [, int $use_include_path = 0
] )

Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.

gzopen() can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this case 
gzread() will directly read from the file without decompression.

参数

filename

    The file name.

mode

    As in fopen() (rb or wb) but can also include a compression level (wb9) or
    a strategy: f for filtered data as in wb6f, h for Huffman only compression
    as in wb1h. (See the description of deflateInit2 in zlib.h for more
    information about the strategy parameter.)

use_include_path

    You can set this optional parameter to 1, if you want to search for the
    file in the include_path too.

返回值

Returns a file pointer to the file opened, after that, everything you read from
this file descriptor will be transparently decompressed and what you write gets
compressed.

If the open fails, the function returns FALSE.

范例

Example #1 gzopen() Example

<?php
$fp = gzopen("/tmp/file.gz", "r");

gzopen("php://output","wb") doesn't work on a web server, nor does fopen
("compress.zlib://php://output","wb").

Here is a snippet to gzip a file and output it on the fly, without using a
temporary file, without reading the file into memory, and without reading the
file more than once:

<?php
$fin = fopen($file, "rb");
if ($fin !== FALSE) {
    $fout = fopen("php://output", "wb");
    if ($fout !== FALSE) {
    // write gzip header
    fwrite($fout, "\x1F\x8B\x08\x08".pack("V", filemtime($file))."\0\xFF", 10);
    // write the original file name
    $oname = str_replace("\0", "", basename($file));
    fwrite($fout, $oname."\0", 1+strlen($oname));
    // add the deflate filter using default compression level
    $fltr = stream_filter_append($fout, "zlib.deflate", STREAM_FILTER_WRITE, -1
);
    // set up the CRC32 hashing context
    $hctx = hash_init("crc32b");
    // turn off the time limit
    if (!ini_get("safe_mode")) set_time_limit(0);
    $con = TRUE;
    $fsize = 0;
    while (($con !== FALSE) && !feof($fin)) {
        // deflate works best with buffers >32K
        $con = fread($fin, 64 * 1024);
        if ($con !== FALSE) {
        hash_update($hctx, $con);
        $clen = strlen($con);
        $fsize += $clen;
        fwrite($fout, $con, $clen);
        }
    }
    // remove the deflate filter
    stream_filter_remove($fltr);
    // write the CRC32 value
    // hash_final is a string, not an integer
    $crc = hash_final($hctx, TRUE);
    // need to reverse the hash_final string so it's little endian
    fwrite($fout, $crc[3].$crc[2].$crc[1].$crc[0], 4);
    // write the original uncompressed file size
    fwrite($fout, pack("V", $fsize), 4);
    fclose($fout);
    }
    fclose($fin);
}
?>

An OO-version of David Gero's excellent GZ File format note also on this page:

<?php

This worked unstable for me under high load (50+ files per second):

<?php
    $gz = gzopen ( $file, 'w9' );
    gzwrite ( $gz, $content );
    gzclose ( $gz );
?>

The following works fine:

<?php
    $f = fopen ( $file, 'w' );
    fwrite ( $f, gzcompress ( $content, 9 ) );
    fclose ( $f );
?>
===============================================================================

WARNING gzopen and gzread have a major disadvantage. They makes NO checksum and
NO length verification of the gzipped data and discard this valuable
information. This should be documented here.
===============================================================================

dtorop932 at hotmail dot com's comments, according to my tests, is incorrect.
That code wishes to download the entire file before parsing, which is
inconvinient. The wget method works though.
===============================================================================

Be aware that when opening a remote file on a http server the gzopen will
return by default false after 120 seconds waiting to any answer.

RE dubious's comment: "Being able to read gzip streams from ftp and http is
near the top of my personal wishlist at the moment..."

One way to read a gzip stream over http is to daisychain stream wrappers, e.g.:

<?
$fp = fopen("compress.zlib://http://some.website.org/example.gz", "r");
?>

"On the fly" gunzipping actually DOES seem to work - it just appears that only
LOCAL streams/files (including php://stdin) can be accessed for some reason.  I
THINK (but have not yet tested) that you could similarly gzopen "php://stdout"
and pass a stream of gzipped data to the browser (when run from a web page) or
console (when run standalone) through there.

I HAVE tested scripts from the command line like:

wget -q -O- ftp://some.host.net/pub/some_gzip_file.gz | php gunzip_stuff.php

where gunzip_stuff.php would be a script that gzopened "php://stdin" and did
gzgets from that stream, and it seems to work fine, but that obviously doesn't
help someone wanting to grab gzipped streams from remote sites from a web-based
script.

Being able to read gzip streams from ftp and http is near the top of my
personal wishlist at the moment...

The CairoFormat class

(PECL cairo >= 0.1.0)

简介

CairoFormat enums are used to identify the memory format of the image data.

预定义常量

CairoFormat::ARGB32

    Each pixel is a 32-bit quantity, with alpha in the upper 8 bits, then red,
    then green, then blue. The 32-bit quantities are stored native-endian.
    Pre-multiplied alpha is used. (That is, 50% transparent red is 0x80800000,
    not 0x80ff0000.)

CairoFormat::RGB24

    Each pixel is a 32-bit quantity, with the upper 8 bits unused. Red, Green,
    and Blue are stored in the remaining 24 bits in that order.

CairoFormat::A8

    Each pixel is a 8-bit quantity holding an alpha value.

CairoFormat::A1

    Each pixel is a 1-bit quantity holding an alpha value. Pixels are packed
    together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits matches the
    endianess of the platform. On a big-endian machine, the first pixel is in
    the uppermost bit, on a little-endian machine the first pixel is in the
    least-significant bit.

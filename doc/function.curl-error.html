===============================================================================

If you want to fetch the error message, make sure you fetch it before you close
the current cURL session or the error message will be reset to an empty string.
===============================================================================

For a 404 response to actually trigger an error as the example seems to be
trying to demonstrate the following option should be set:

curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_FAILONERROR,true);

As per http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html

CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22)
This is returned if CURLOPT_FAILONERROR is set TRUE and the HTTP server returns
an error code that is >= 400. (This error code was formerly known as
CURLE_HTTP_NOT_FOUND.)

While working with curl i got the following error: "empty reply from server".

Searching Google gave no solutions. So i just tried to replace the spaces from
the url to %20 and it worked!

Hope this helps someone.

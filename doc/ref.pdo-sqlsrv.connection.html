PDO_SQLSRV DSN — Connecting to MS SQL Server and SQL Azure databases

说明

The PDO_SQLSRV Data Source Name (DSN) is composed of the following elements:

DSN prefix

    The DSN prefix is sqlsrv:.

APP

    The application name used in tracing.

ConnectionPooling

    Specifies whether the connection is assigned from a connection pool (1 or
    TRUE) or not (0 or FALSE).

Database

    The name of the database.

Encrypt

    Specifies whether the communication with SQL Server is encrypted (1 or TRUE
    ) or unencrypted (0 or FALSE).

Failover_Partner

    Specifies the server and instance of the database's mirror (if enabled and
    configured) to use when the primary server is unavailable.

LoginTimeout

    Specifies the number of seconds to wait before failing the connection
    attempt.

MultipleActiveResultSets

    Disables or explicitly enables support for multiple active Result sets
    (MARS).

QuotedId

    Specifies whether to use SQL-92 rules for quoted identifiers (1 or TRUE) or
    to use legacy Transact-SQL rules (0 or false).

Server

    The name of the database server.

TraceFile

    Specifies the path for the file used for trace data.

TraceOn

    Specifies whether ODBC tracing is enabled (1 or TRUE) or disabled (0 or
    FALSE) for the connection being established.

TransactionIsolation

    Specifies the transaction isolation level. The accepted values for this
    option are PDO::SQLSRV_TXN_READ_UNCOMMITTED,
    PDO::SQLSRV_TXN_READ_COMMITTED, PDO::SQLSRV_TXN_REPEATABLE_READ,
    PDO::SQLSRV_TXN_SNAPSHOT, and PDO::SQLSRV_TXN_SERIALIZABLE.

TrustServerCertificate

    Specifies whether the client should trust (1 or TRUE) or reject (0 or FALSE
    ) a self-signed server certificate.

WSID

    Specifies the name of the computer for tracing.

Example #1 PDO_SQLSRV DSN examples

The following example shows how to connecto to a specified MS SQL Server
database:

$c = new PDO("sqlsrv:Server=localhost;Database=testdb", "UserName", "Password");

The following example shows how to connect to a MS SQL Server database on a
specified port:

$c = new PDO("sqlsrv:Server=localhost,1521;Database=testdb", "UserName", "Password");

The following example shows how to connecto to a SQL Azure database with server
ID 12345abcde. Note that when you connect to SQL Azure with PDO, your username
will be UserName@12345abcde (UserName@ServerId).

$c = new PDO("sqlsrv:Server=12345abcde.database.windows.net;Database=testdb", "UserName@12345abcde", "Password");

===============================================================================

I suspect the problem with "Server=foo-sql\MSSQLSERVER" was you didn't escape
the backslash, with a backslash.

If hostname worked, than IP would work as well given a hostname resolves to an
IP unless your DNS was mapping to the wrong IP which would be a simple issue.

I suspect you are running your web services on the same host as mssql?  If so,
confirm that your mssql server is set to bind to IP addresses (if you want
access from the outside of that box).  If you are only able to connect via a
name (as in a NetBIOS or Active Directory name), it's likely you are connecting
to a "socket" or named pipe.

I found with MS-SQL Server 2008 on Windows Server 2008 R2 that I needed to use
the MSSQL Server name. The servers hostname or IP address would not work ( with
or without port, and/or SQL instance name, etc.) After trying several
combinations, this is what I found worked in my configuration:

host-ip: 10.4.2.50
host-name: mssqlhost.mydomain.org
mssql-server-name: foo-sql
mssql-instance-name: MSSQLSERVER
database-name: mydb

<?php

$dbh = new PDO("sqlsrv:Server=foo-sql,1433;Database=mydb", $user , $pass);

?>

The above worked with and without port (,1433). I also noticed adding the
instance name (MSSQLSERVER) after the server name with a slash (\), as in
"Server=foo-sql\MSSQLSERVER" caused a failure to connect.
===============================================================================

Adding the backslash solved the problem for me.

Here's my functioning localdb connection string:

new PDO("sqlsrv:Server=(localdb)\\v11.0 ; Database = my_db ; AttachDBFilename =
C:\Users\user\my_db.mdf", "", "");

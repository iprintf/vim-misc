is_file

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

is_file — 判断给定文件名是否为一个正常的文件

说明

bool is_file ( string $filename )

判断给定文件名是否为一个正常的文件。

参数

filename

    文件的路径。

返回值

如果文件存在且为正常的文件则返回 TRUE，否则返回 FALSE。

    Note: 因为 PHP 的整数类型是有符号整型而且很多平台使用 32 位整型，对 2GB 以
    上的文件，一些文件系统函数可能返回无法预期的结果。

范例

Example #1 is_file() 例子

<?php
var_dump(is_file('a_file.txt')) . "\n";
var_dump(is_file('/usr/bin/')) . "\n";
?>

以上例程会输出：

bool(true)
bool(false)

错误／异常

失败时抛出E_WARNING警告。

Tip

自 PHP 5.0.0 起, 此函数也用于某些 URL 包装器。请参见支持的协议和封装协议以获得
支持 stat() 系列函数功能的包装器列表。

Note that is_file() returns false if the parent directory doesn't have +x set
for you; this make sense, but other functions such as readdir() don't seem to
have this limitation. The end result is that you can loop through a directory's
files but is_file() will always fail.
===============================================================================

if you're running apache as a service on a win32 machine, an you try to
determinate if a file on an other pc in your network exists - ex.: is_file('//
servername/share/dir1/dir2/file.txt') - you may return false when you're
running the service as LocalSystem. To avoid this, you have to start the
Apache-Service as a 'registered' domain user.

regarding note from rehfeld dot us :

In my experience the best( and easiest ) way to find the extension of a file is
:

<?php

// use this when you are sure it actually has an extension.
$extension = end(explode(".", $file_name));

?>

or

<?php

// this one will also check if it actually has an extension
$parts = explode(".", $file_name);
if (is_array($parts) && count($parts) > 1)
    $extension = end($parts);

?>
===============================================================================

here is a workaround for the file size limit. uses bash file testing operator,
so it may be changed to test directories etc.  (see http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/
html/fto.html for possible test operators)

<?php
function is_file_lfs($path){
    exec('[ -f "'.$path.'" ]', $tmp, $ret);
    return $ret == 0;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Maybe this is a newbie mistake, but note that paths are relative to the
filesystem and the location of the script.  This means that MS IIS virtual
directories are not available by relative path - use an absolute.
This threw me because virtual directories ARE available for URLs, at least on
IIS.
===============================================================================

be careful, is_file() fails on files larger than your integer storage (2^32 for
most).

Warning: is_file(): Stat failed for bigfile (errno=75 - Value too large for
defined data type)
===============================================================================

I tend to use alot of includes, and I found that the is_file is based on the
script executed, not ran.
if you request /foo.php and foo.php looks like this:
<?php
include('foobar/bar.php');
?>
and bar.php looks like this:
<?php
echo (is_file('foo/bar.txt'));
?>

Then PHP (on win32, php 5.x) would look for /foo/bar.txt and not /foobar/foo/
bar.txt.
you would have to rewrite the is_file statement for that, or change working
directory.
Noting this since I sat with the problem for some time,

cheers, Toxik.

In PHP 4.1.0 under win32, this seems to print out a warning message if the file
does not exist (using error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE).

This Function deletes everything in a defined Folder:
Works with PHP 4 and 5.

<?php
  function deletefolder($path)
  {
    if ($handle=opendir($path))
    {
      while (false!==($file=readdir($handle)))
      {
        if ($file<>"." AND $file<>"..")
        {
          if (is_file($path.'/'.$file))
          {
            @unlink($path.'/'.$file);
          }
          if (is_dir($path.'/'.$file))
          {
            deletefolder($path.'/'.$file);
            @rmdir($path.'/'.$file);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
?>
===============================================================================

It took me a day or so to figure out that is_file() actually looks for a valid
$ existing path/file in string form. It is not performing a pattern-like test
on the parameter given. Its testing to see if the given parameter leads to a
specific  existing 'name.ext' or other (non-directory) file type object.
===============================================================================

In 32 bit environments, these functions including is_file(), stat() filesize()
will not work due to PHPs default integer being signed. So anything above ~2.1
billion bytes you actually get a negative value.

This is actually a bug but I dont think there is an easy workaround. Try to
switch to 64 bit.
===============================================================================

I see, is_file not work properly on specifical file in /dev (linux)
look :

root@boofh:/data# php -r "var_dump(is_file('/dev/core'));"
bool(true)
root@boofh:/data# php -r "var_dump(is_file('/proc/kcore'));"
bool(true)

root@boofh:/data# ls -alh /proc/kcore
-r-------- 1 root root 128T Aug 13 18:39 /proc/kcore

OR FIND do not detect regular file.
root@boofh:/data# find /dev/ -type f
root@boofh:/data#

// version of php :
root@boofh:/data# php -v

Today I got the in the comments already described behaviour that between
directory and file can't be distinguished by is_file() or is_dir().
A dirty and incomplete hack is below, incomplete because it never includes
links and I never tested what happens when a directory is not allowed to be
read.

$items = scandir($dir);
foreach ($items as $item){
    if ($item!='.' && $item!='..'){
        $deep = @scandir($dir.'/'.$item);
        echo ($deep ? '[DIR] ':'[FILE] '.$item.nl2br(PHP_EOL);
    }
}
===============================================================================

is_file doesn't recognize files whose filenames contain strange characters like
czech ů or russian characters in general.

I've seen many scripts that take it for granted that a path is a directory when
it fails is_file($path). When trying to determine whether a path links to a
file or a dir, you should always use is_dir after getting false from is_file
($path). For cases like described above, both will fail.
===============================================================================

### Symbolic links are resolved ###

If you pass a symlink (unix symbolic link) as parameter, is_file will resolve
the symlink and will give information about the refered file. For example:

  touch file
  ln -s file link
  echo '<? if (is_file("link")) echo "y\n"; ?>' | php -q

will print "y".

is_dir resolves symlinks too.
===============================================================================

sometimes this function does not work because permission ,

you can use this function that check if the path has dot in last will return
true .

public function isFile($file) {
        $f = pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
        return (strlen($f) > 0) ? true : false;
    }
 
isfile('http://www.ip4t.net/image.jpg');

you should replace a string between '' with your file path to check
===============================================================================

I have noticed that using is_file on windows servers (mainly for development)
to use a full path c:\ doesn't always work.

I have had to use
C:/foldertowww/site/file.ext

so I preform an str_replace('\\', '/', $path)
Sometimes I have had the \ instead of / work. (this is using apache2 on XP)

but for sure you cannot have mixed separators.
===============================================================================

An easy way not to have to choose between hard-coding full paths and using
relative paths is either via this line:

<?php
// in the bootstrap file
define('DIR_ROOT', dirname(__FILE__));
// in other files, prefix paths with the constant
require(DIR_ROOT . '/relative/to/bootstrap.php');
?>

or if you have to use a relative path:

<?php
require(dirname(__FILE__) . '/relative/to/this_file.php');
?>

This way all your paths will be absolute, yet you can move the application
anywhere in the filesystem.

BTW, each successive call to dirname takes you one step up in the directory
tree.

<?php
echo __FILE__;
// /www/site.com/public/index.php
echo dirname(__FILE__);
// /www/site.com/public
echo dirname(dirname(__FILE__));
// /www/site.com
?>
===============================================================================

this is a simple way to find specific files instead of using is_file().
this example is made for mac standards, but easily changed for pc.

<?php
function isfile($file){
    return preg_match('/^[^.^:^?^\-][^:^?]*\.(?i)' . getexts() . '$/',$file);
    //first character cannot be . : ? - subsequent characters can't be a : ?
    //then a . character and must end with one of your extentions
    //getexts() can be replaced with your extentions pattern
}

function getexts(){
    //list acceptable file extensions here
    return '(app|avi|doc|docx|exe|ico|mid|midi|mov|mp3|
                 mpg|mpeg|pdf|psd|qt|ra|ram|rm|rtf|txt|wav|word|xls)';
}

echo isfile('/Users/YourUserName/Sites/index.html');
?>
===============================================================================

I do a lot of file parsing and have found the following technique extremely
useful:

while (false !== ($document = readdir($my_dir)))
{
    $ext=explode('.',$document);
    if($document != '.' && $document != '..' && $ext[1])
    {
                       'Do something to file...'
              }
}

It gets around the fact that, when working on website pages, the html files are
read as directories when downloaded. It also allows you to extend the
usefulness of the above method by adding the ability to determine file types
e.g.

if($document != '.' && $document != '..' && $ext[1]=='htm')
or
if($document != '.' && $document != '..' && $ext[1]=='doc')
===============================================================================

regarding rlh at d8acom dot com method,

It is incorrect. Well, it works but you are not guaranteed the file extension
using that method.

for example :   filename.inc.php

your method will tell you the ext is "inc", but it is in fact "php"

heres a way that will work properly.

<?php

$dh = opendir($dir);

while (false !== ($document = readdir($dh))) {
    $pos = strrpos($document, '.');
    if (false !== $pos && strlen($document) > $pos + 1) {
        $ext = substr($document, $pos + 1);
    }
}

?>
===============================================================================

Please be aware wildcards do not work as one might expect.

<?php
$file = '*.*';

if ( is_file($file) ) {
  echo( $file . ' is a regular file' );
} else {
  echo( $file . ' is not a regular file' );
}
?>

The above snippet suggests that *.* is a regular file. It does not sound
regular to me. I would expect is_file() to return FALSE.

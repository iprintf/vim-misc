===============================================================================

Contrary to the previous post, this function (pdf_place_image)  is deprecated.
Use pdf_fit_image() instead.  pdf_fit_image() takes the same parameters but
read the PDFlib manual.

You should be using and reading the PDFlib manual along with the PHP manual to
be current while writing your code.

To see all the internal functions available in the PDFlib try this:

$arr = get_defined_functions();
foreach(array_values($arr['internal']) as $arrVal){
    if(strtolower(substr($arrVal,0,3))== "pdf") print($arrVal."<br>");
}

Please do your homework before posting a note that contradicts someone else s
note.
===============================================================================

FYI:
There's a good reason for the fact that we need two functions

(pdf_open_image_file and pdf_place_image)

to insert an image.
This way we can use the same image more than once without having to store it in
the PDF again.

I think you're confused.  The depreciated function was pdf_put_image not
pdf_place_image.

If this is also depreciated then we don't have any functions to add images to a
PDF.  Not a good thing.

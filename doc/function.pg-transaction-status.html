pg_transaction_status

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7)

pg_transaction_status — Returns the current in-transaction status of the
server.

说明

int pg_transaction_status ( resource $connection )

Returns the current in-transaction status of the server.

Caution

pg_transaction_status() will give incorrect results when using a PostgreSQL 7.3
server that has the parameter autocommit set to off. The server-side autocommit
feature has been deprecated and does not exist in later server versions.

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource.

返回值

The status can be PGSQL_TRANSACTION_IDLE (currently idle),
PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE (a command is in progress), PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INTRANS
(idle, in a valid transaction block), or PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INERROR (idle, in a
failed transaction block). PGSQL_TRANSACTION_UNKNOWN is reported if the
connection is bad. PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE is reported only when a query has
been sent to the server and not yet completed.

范例

Example #1 pg_transaction_status() example

<?php
  $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  $stat = pg_transaction_status($dbconn);
  if ($stat === PGSQL_TRANSACTION_UNKNOWN) {
      echo 'Connection is bad';
  } else if ($stat === PGSQL_TRANSACTION_IDLE) {
      echo 'Connection is currently idle';
  } else {
      echo 'Connection is in a transaction state';
  }    
?>

===============================================================================

This function is implemented in C, so there's no way to mimic it in SQL for
older versions of PHP.  But you can mimic some of the functionality by using a
wrapper which keeps track of when you begin and commit/rollback transactions.

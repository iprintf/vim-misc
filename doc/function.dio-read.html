===============================================================================

I am using dio functions on windows to read RS232 port.
I can read/write but it seems that the write function cannot be binary.

In particular:
dio_write($com1,chr(10),1); will result in writing 2 bytes 0D 0A be cause \n is
translated to \r\n. I have not found any way to overcome this limitation so far
===============================================================================

Note that dio_read on Windows (other platforms unknown) will not timeout if
there is no data to read. There is no way to specify a timeout or do a
non-blocking read on Windows.

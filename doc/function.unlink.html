This will delete all files in a directory matching a pattern in one line of
code.

<?php array_map('unlink', glob("some/dir/*.txt")); ?>
===============================================================================

Deleted a large file but seeing no increase in free space or decrease of disk
usage? Using UNIX or other POSIX OS?

The unlink() is not about removing file, it's about removing a file name. The
manpage says: ``unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to''.

Most of the time a file has just one name -- removing it will also remove
(free, deallocate) the `body' of file (with one caveat, see below). That's the
simple, usual case.

However, it's perfectly fine for a file to have several names (see the link()
function), in the same or different directories. All the names will refer to
the file body and `keep it alive', so to say. Only when all the names are
removed, the body of file actually is freed.

The caveat:
A file's body may *also* be `kept alive' (still using diskspace) by a process
holding the file open. The body will not be deallocated (will not free disk
space) as long as the process holds it open. In fact, there's a fancy way of
resurrecting a file removed by a mistake but still held open by a process...

Here the simplest way to delete files with mask

<?php
   $mask = "*.jpg"
   array_map( "unlink", glob( $mask ) );
?>
===============================================================================

To delete all files of a particular extension, or infact, delete all with
wildcard, a much simplar way is to use the glob function.  Say I wanted to
delete all jpgs .........

<?php

foreach (glob("*.jpg") as $filename) {
   echo "$filename size " . filesize($filename) . "\n";
   unlink($filename);
}

?>
===============================================================================

unlink($fileName); failed for me .
Then i tried using the realpath($fileName)  function as
unlink(realpath($fileName)); it worked

just posting it , in case if any one finds it useful .
===============================================================================

I have been working on some little tryout where a backup file was created
before modifying the main textfile. Then when an error is thrown, the main file
will be deleted (unlinked) and the backup file is returned instead.

Though, I have been breaking my head for about an hour on why I couldn't get my
persmissions right to unlink the main file.

Finally I knew what was wrong: because I was working on the file and hadn't yet
closed the file, it was still in use and ofcourse couldn't be deleted :)

So I thought of mentoining this here, to avoid others of making the same
mistake:

<?php
// First close the file
fclose($fp);

// Then unlink :)
unlink($somefile);
?>
===============================================================================

This might seem obvious, but I was tearing my hair out with this problem - make
sure the file you're trying to delete isn't currently being used. I had a
script that was parsing a text file and was supposed to delete it after
completing, but kept getting a permission denied error because I hadn't
explicitly closed the file, hence it was technically still being "used" even
though the parsing was complete.
===============================================================================

To anyone who's had a problem with the permissions denied error, it's sometimes
caused when you try to delete a file that's in a folder higher in the hierarchy
to your working directory (i.e. when trying to delete a path that starts with
"../").

So to work around this problem, you can use chdir() to change the working
directory to the folder where the file you want to unlink is located.

<?php
    $old = getcwd(); // Save the current directory
    chdir($path_to_file);
    unlink($filename);
    chdir($old); // Restore the old working directory   
?>
===============================================================================

Here is the recursive delete method made a little more readable:

<?php
/**
* Recursively delete a directory
*
* @param string $dir Directory name
* @param boolean $deleteRootToo Delete specified top-level directory as well
*/
function unlinkRecursive($dir, $deleteRootToo)
{
    if(!$dh = @opendir($dir))
    {
        return;
    }
    while (false !== ($obj = readdir($dh)))
    {
        if($obj == '.' || $obj == '..')
        {
            continue;
        }

        if (!@unlink($dir . '/' . $obj))
        {
            unlinkRecursive($dir.'/'.$obj, true);
        }
    }

    closedir($dh);
   
    if ($deleteRootToo)
    {
        @rmdir($dir);
    }
   
    return;
}
?>
===============================================================================

On OSX, when fighting against a "Permission Denied" error, make sure, the
directory has WRITE permissions for the executing php-user.

Furthermore, if you rely on ACLs, and want to delete a file or symlink, the
containing directory needs to have "delete_child" permission in order to unlink
things inside. If you only grant "delete" to the folder that will allow you to
delete the container folder itself, but not the objects inside.

ggarciaa's post above has already one small error, closedir has to be used even
if $DeleteMe is false

function SureRemoveDir($dir, $DeleteMe) {
    if(!$dh = @opendir($dir)) return;
    while (false !== ($obj = readdir($dh))) {
        if($obj=='.' || $obj=='..') continue;

This code deletes all files from directory, but there's a secret :)
I killed a lot of time before I realized my mistake.
I used jquery to create event in frame.
@ - it`s a secret :)

$dir = '../upload_tmp/';
if($dh = opendir($dir)){
    while(($file = readdir($dh))!== false){
        if(file_exists($dir.$file)) @unlink($dir.$file);
    }
        closedir($dh);
}
===============================================================================

remove directory with all content

<?php
$dir = "boss"; // directory name
?>

<?php
foreach (scandir($dir) as $item) {
    if ($item == '.' || $item == '..') continue;
    unlink($dir.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$item);
}
rmdir($dir);
?>
===============================================================================

unlink can fail after using ODBC commands on the file (on Windows).

Neither <?php odbc_free_result($result); ?> nor <?php odbc_close($conn); unset(
$conn); ?> did the trick.

Only <?php odbc_close_all(); ?> released the file such that it could be deleted
afterwards ...
===============================================================================

before you could unlink a file created which uses a handle e.g.,

$handle = sqlite('temp.db');

unset($handle); first befofe
unlink($handle);

to avoide permission denied error.
===============================================================================

using this function with windows will generate an error, make sure to use
is_file
===============================================================================

This is in response to alvaro at demogracia dot com

Yes, I found that out and have had to wrap it with is_file:

<?php
if(is_file("$file")) {
unlink("$file");
}
?>
===============================================================================

Here you have a function to delete a directory and subdirectories recursively:

function deleteDirectory($dir){
    $result = false;
    if ($handle = opendir("$dir")){
        $result = true;
        while ((($file=readdir($handle))!==false) && ($result)){
            if ($file!='.' && $file!='..'){
                if (is_dir("$dir/$file")){
                    $result = deleteDirectory("$dir/$file");
                } else {
                    $result = unlink("$dir/$fich");
                }
            }
        }
        closedir($handle);
        if ($result){
            $result = rmdir($dir);
        }
    }
    return $result;
}

Complete retardation. This does NOT delete the file.
===============================================================================

Actually you should use "@unlink" rather than testing with file_exists. The
former is atomic, whereas the latter can break if you can't guarantee only one
process will try to delete a given file at a time.
===============================================================================

Shorter'n'faster version of Eddys "The shortest recursive delete possible"

function rrmdir($path)
{
  return is_file($path)?
    @unlink($path):
    array_map('rrmdir',glob($path.'/*'))==@rmdir($path)
  ;
}
===============================================================================

[Editor's note: A suggestion for a work-around was submitted by argistof at
gmail dot com: You can use the recursive option (see man chmod) when chmodding,
for instance 'chmod 777 directory/ -R'. Be aware though, this will change the
permissions of all files and folders in the diectory.]

Just a note which you probably all know, but I didn't, and it might save
another poor sap some unnecessary time:

I was doing unlink() and fopen() on a file and got a permission denied error,
even after chmoding the file to 0777. 

The folder that contains the file must ALSO have write permission.  Took a
headache to find this out. 

Hope this helps someone :)
===============================================================================

Under Windows System and Apache, denied access to file is an usual error to
unlink file.
To delete file you must to change file's owern.
An example:

<?php
chown($TempDirectory."/".$FileName,666); //Insert an Invalid UserId to set to
Nobody Owern; 666 is my standard for "Nobody"
unlink($TempDirectory."/".$FileName);
?>
===============================================================================

Here is simple function that will find and remove all files (except "." ones)
that match the expression ($match, "*" as wildcard) under starting directory
($path) and all other directories under it.

function rfr($path,$match){
   static $deld = 0, $dsize = 0;
   $dirs = glob($path."*");
   $files = glob($path.$match);
   foreach($files as $file){
      if(is_file($file)){
         $dsize += filesize($file);
         unlink($file);
         $deld++;
      }
   }
   foreach($dirs as $dir){
      if(is_dir($dir)){
         $dir = basename($dir) . "/";
         rfr($path.$dir,$match);
      }
   }
   return "$deld files deleted with a total size of $dsize bytes";
}

ggarciaa's post above has one small error, it will ignore file and directory
strings that are evaluated as false (ie. "0")

Fixed code is below (false !==)

To delete files using wildcards:

<?
function delfile($str)
{
    foreach(glob($str) as $fn) {
        unlink($fn);
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

The best way to delete files by mask is as follows:
<?php
array_walk(glob('/etc/*'), 'unlink');
?>
Do not use array_map mentioned below - it's purpose is to process values in a
given array AND COLLECT data returned by the callback function. So, array_map
is slower and uses additional memory compared to array_walk.
===============================================================================

<?php
$myFile = "testFile.txt";
$fh = fopen($myFile, 'w') or die("can't open file");
fclose($fh);
?>

Now to delete testFile.txt we simply run a PHP script that is located in the
same directory. Unlink just needs to know the name of the file to start working
its destructive magic.

<?php
$myFile = "testFile.txt";
unlink($myFile);
?>

The testFile.txt should now be removed.

The shortest recursive delete possible.

To unlink, the web server user must have write permissions to the directory.

Conversely, if a user has write permissions to a directory, it may delete files
from that directory regardless of who owns them...
===============================================================================

I know it is obvious, but.... if you have nested symlinks (for example, we
archive into yyyy-mm for backups, and symbolic link to make our directory
structure look flat - don't ask), unlink will only delete the top level symlink
(as expected).

If you want to delete the actual file, you'll need to use readlink. If you want
to delete all of the files and the symlinks, you'll need to recurse up and down
to achieve that.

===============================================================================

The recommended way to do a SQLite3 query is to use a statement. For a table
creation, a query might be fine (and easier) but for an insert, update or
select, you should really use a statement, it's really easier and safer as
SQLite will escape your parameters according to their type. SQLite will also
use less memory than if you created the whole query by yourself. Example:

<?php

$db = new SQLite3;
$statement = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = :id;');
$statement->bindValue(':id', $id);

$result = $statement->execute();

?>

You can also re-use a statement and change its parameters, just do $statement->
reset(). Finally don't forget to close a statement when you don't need it
anymore as it will free some memory.
===============================================================================

The notes for the return value is a little misleading to me. It states that if
the query does not "return results" TRUE or FALSE is returned instead. If there
is a return value for this method in your PHP code this method always returns
an SQLite3Result object, even if you accidentally run an INSERT, UPDATE,
DELETE, CREATE TABLE, etc query through it. The only time it returns a TRUE or
FALSE is if there is no return value.

<?php
$result = $dbh->query('CREATE TABLE ...');
if (!($result instanceof Sqlite3Result)) {
    echo "Query successful."; // This will never echo.
} else {
    $result->fetchArray(); // This will throw an error.
}

if ($dbh->query('CREATE TABLE ...')) {
    echo "Query successful."; // Works
} else {
    echo "Query failed."; // Will also work
}
?>
Use exec() if you are not executing a SELECT query.

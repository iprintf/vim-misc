ldap_search — Search LDAP tree

说明

resource ldap_search ( resource $link_identifier , string $base_dn , string
$filter [, array $attributes [, int $attrsonly [, int $sizelimit [, int
$timelimit [, int $deref ]]]]] )

Performs the search for a specified filter on the directory with the scope of
LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE. This is equivalent to searching the entire directory.

From 4.0.5 on it's also possible to do parallel searches. To do this you use an
array of link identifiers, rather than a single identifier, as the first
argument. If you don't want the same base DN and the same filter for all the
searches, you can also use an array of base DNs and/or an array of filters.
Those arrays must be of the same size as the link identifier array since the
first entries of the arrays are used for one search, the second entries are
used for another, and so on. When doing parallel searches an array of search
result identifiers is returned, except in case of error, then the entry
corresponding to the search will be FALSE. This is very much like the value
normally returned, except that a result identifier is always returned when a
search was made. There are some rare cases where the normal search returns
FALSE while the parallel search returns an identifier.

参数

link_identifier

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

base_dn

    The base DN for the directory.

filter

    The search filter can be simple or advanced, using boolean operators in the
    format described in the LDAP documentation (see the » Netscape Directory
    SDK or » RFC4515 for full information on filters).

attributes

    An array of the required attributes, e.g. array("mail", "sn", "cn"). Note
    that the "dn" is always returned irrespective of which attributes types are
    requested.

    Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action (which
    is to return all attributes and their associated values). The use of this
    parameter should therefore be considered good practice.

attrsonly

    Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0 both
    attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the default
    behaviour.

sizelimit

    Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0 means
    no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

        Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than a
        preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate that
        it has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if you use
        this parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.

timelimit

    Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting this to
    0 means no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

deref

    Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search. It can be one of
    the following:
      □ LDAP_DEREF_NEVER - (default) aliases are never dereferenced.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be dereferenced during the search
        but not when locating the base object of the search.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be dereferenced when locating the
        base object but not during the search.
      □ LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS - aliases should be dereferenced always.

返回值

Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.

范例

The example below retrieves the organizational unit, surname, given name and
email address for all people in "My Company" where the surname or given name
contains the substring $person. This example uses a boolean filter to tell the
server to look for information in more than one attribute.

Example #1 LDAP search

<?php
// $ds is a valid link identifier for a directory server

// $person is all or part of a person's name, eg "Jo"

$dn = "o=My Company, c=US";
$filter="(|(sn=$person*)(givenname=$person*))";
$justthese = array("ou", "sn", "givenname", "mail");

$sr=ldap_search($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);

$info = ldap_get_entries($ds, $sr);

echo $info["count"]." entries returned\n";
?>

Here are a couple of resources for proper construction of filters.

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/En-US/library/aa746475.aspx

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa996205.aspx

Before finding these I had been stumped for hours on how to do something like
"all users starting with "a" except those from OU 'foo'"
===============================================================================

When searching for BINARY data (such as an Active Directory objectGUID) you
need to escape each hexadecimal character with a backslash.

The following command line run of ldapsearch shows:
ldapsearch -b "dc=blahblah,dc=com" "(objectGUID=\AE\C3\23\35\F7)"

In PHP, you need to escape the escape for the backslash:
ldap_search($ds,"dc=blahblah,dc=com", "(objectGUID=\\AE\\C3\\23\\35\\F7)");
===============================================================================

It might be useful to list here the operators that work:

=         - matches exact value
=*xxx  - matches values ending xxx
=xxx*  - matches values beginning xxx
=*xxx* - matches values containing xxx
=*       - matches all values (if set - NULLS are not returned)

>=xxx  - matches everthing from xxx to end of directory
<=xxx  - matches everything up to xxx in directory

~=xxx      - matches similar entries (not all systems)

Boolean operators for constructing complex search

&(term1)(term2)  - matches term1 AND term2
| (term1)(term2)  - matches term1 OR term2
!(term1)                 - matches NOT term1
&(|(term1)(term2))(!(&(term1)(term2)) - matches XOR term1 term2

some of the more compelx constructions seem to work with varying  degrees of
efficiency - sometimes it can be better to filter some of the results with the
search and do further filtering in PHP.
===============================================================================

it seems that all fields must be used in lower case even if they are mixed case
in the ldapsearch output.

example:

gidNumber: 1010
homeDirectory: /home/dnt

must be:

echo "gid: " . $info[$i]["gidnumber"][0] . "<br>";
echo "home directory: ". $info[$i]["homedirectory"][0] ."<br>";

not ( $info[$i]["homeDirectory"][0] ) etc.
===============================================================================

Be careful of special characters when generating filters from user input.

*, (, ), \ and NUL should be backslash-escaped. See section 4 of RFC 2254 (I
found it here:
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2254.html)
===============================================================================

Minor clarification on AD LDAP searchs. Small typo in previous example, and
does not display multiple values per attribute. Here's the for loop to
enumerate all entries, attributes, and values:

$bind = ldap_bind($connect) // asume anon connect or add user/pass
     or exit(">>Could not bind to $ldap_host<<");
$read = ldap_search($connect, $base_dn, $filter)
     or exit(">>Unable to search ldap server<<");
$info = ldap_get_entries($connect, $read);
echo $info["count"]." entries returned<br>";
// $i = entries
// $ii = attributes for entry
// $iii = values per attribute
for ($i = 0; $i<$info["count"]; $i++) {
  for ($ii=0; $ii<$info[$i]["count"]; $ii++){
     $data = $info[$i][$ii];
     for ($iii=0; $iii<$info[$i][$data]["count"]; $iii++) {
       echo $data.":&nbsp;&nbsp;".$info[$i][$data][$iii]."<br>";
     }
  }
echo "<p>"; // separate entries
===============================================================================

Example of parallel search :

<?php
$basedn=array('dmdName=users,dc=foo,dc=fr','dmdName=users,dc=bar,dc=com');  //
two basedn
$filter='(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=*))';  // single filter
$attributes=array('dn','uid','sn');

$cnx = ldap_connect('localhost',389); // single connection
ldap_set_option($cnx, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);

ldap_bind($cnx,'uid=root,dc=foo,dc=fr','password');  // authentication on two
BDB
ldap_bind($cnx,'uid=root,dc=bar,dc=com','password');

$search = ldap_search(array($cnx,$cnx),$basedn,$filter,$attributes);  // search

// result
for($i=0;$i<count($search);$i++){
    print_r(ldap_get_entries($cnx,$search[$i]));
    print "\n";
}
?>
===============================================================================

The internal attributes (like createTimestamp, modifyTimestamp, etc), don't
come by default (when the optional parameter attributes is not set). You have
to specify it:

<?
$r=ldap_search($ds,$base,$filter,array("createTimestamp"));
?>
===============================================================================

Try to use ldap_list(), if possible.  It is much faster.  ldap_search searches
a scope of LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, but ldap_list searches a scope of just
LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL.  This made a big difference on Novell eDirectory 8.6.1,
even for a query that only returned 130 objects.  Using an attribute list, the
4th function parameter (of either function), also made queries faster.
===============================================================================

To do subtree search from top DN in Active Directory, Make sure you do your
ldap_set_option().

<?php
$ldap_host = "pdc.php.net";
$base_dn = "DC=php,DC=net";
$filter = "(cn=Joe User)";
$ldap_user  = "CN=Joe User,OU=Sales,DC=php,DC=net";
$ldap_pass = "pass";
$connect = ldap_connect( $ldap_host, $ldap_port)
         or exit(">>Could not connect to LDAP server<<");
ldap_set_option($connect, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
ldap_set_option($connect, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);
$bind = ldap_bind($connect, $ldap_user, $ldap_pass)
      or exit(">>Could not bind to $ldap_host<<");
$read = ldap_search($connect, $base_dn, $filter)
      or exit(">>Unable to search ldap server<<");
$info = ldap_get_entries($connect, $read);
echo $info["count"]." entries returned<p>";
$ii=0;
for ($i=0; $ii<$info[$i]["count"]; $ii++){
    $data = $info[$i][$ii];
    echo $data.":&nbsp;&nbsp;".$info[$i][$data][0]."<br>";
}
ldap_close($connect);
?>
===============================================================================

In order to perform the searches on Windows 2003 Server Active Directory you
have to set the LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS option to 0:

ldap_set_option($ldap, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);

Without this, you will get "Operations error" if you try to search the whole AD
schema (using root of the domain as a $base_dn).

As opposed to Windows 2000 Server, where this option was optional and only
increased the performance.
===============================================================================

I ran into the problem, that the attribute I was search for had the matching
rule of "exactMatch".

Example:
E-Mail Address is stored in mixed case: John.Doe@example.com

LDAP Search will not retrieve any values when the user enters:
john.doe@example.com

Solution: instead of comparing user input and attribute value by

<?php
if($data[$i]['mail'][0] == $username) {
    // this will run into nothing
}
?>

use strcasecmp instead:

<?php
if(strcasecmp($data[$i]['mail'][0], $username) == 0) {
    // works
}
===============================================================================

Following from my note of 11-Nov-2009 06:56 regarding DN issues when using LDAP
instead of the Global Catalog when querying AD, further investigation was
showing that although the results were in the packet, I was getting an error
instead:

'Search: Can't contact LDAP server' AKA Error 81.

Using more detailed analysis:

ldap_get_option($ds,LDAP_OPT_ERROR_STRING,$error);

echo $error

Displayed:

Referral: ldap://DomainDnsZones.defg.de.bc.ac.uk/ DC=DomainDnsZonesDC=defg,DC=
de,DC=abc,DC=ac,DC=uk

By using trial and error, the error went away and results returned when using:

ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
===============================================================================

I just posted on the ldap_bind, but I figured it couldn't hurt here since this
was the first place I stopped when trying to figure out my problem.  My error
pointed to ldap_search, but specifying the ldap_connect port was the fix.

When you want to search the entire directory for MS AD, you must specify port
3268 in your bind.  This is also true for apache auth_ldap.

$ldapserver = ldap_connect($server,3268);
===============================================================================

It appears that the Netscape Directory SDK (developer.netscape.com) referenced
for LDAP filter information is no longer accepting connections.   The A copy of
RFC 2254 which defines the standard for string representations of LDAP filters
can be found  at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt
===============================================================================

PHP 4.3.10

I was trying to do an ldapsearch without a basedn.  First, I tried with ' ', as
suggested above, but it gave me invalid dn syntax error.

ie:
$sr=ldap_search($ds, ' ', $filter);
Warning: ldap_search(): Search: Invalid DN syntax in ...

Then I changed it to
$sr=ldap_search($ds, "", $filter);

Which gave me the following error:
Warning: ldap_search(): Search: No such object in ...

With that I then modified my ldap.conf file and commented out the BASE field
#BASE   dc=example, dc=com

Then it worked!

So it looks like if you supply a blank basedn, then it will use your default
basedn in ldap.conf.
===============================================================================

If you are searching active directory and are experiencing lag or time outs, it
may be that you are being given ldap referrals from the ldap server. The
following code will disable this.

<?
ldap_set_option($connect, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);
?>
===============================================================================

When I tried to search with empty base DN on OpenLDAP server which had ""
namingContext I got result "no such object". In the log file there was query
for dn: dc=example,dc=com (!).
As a workaround, it seems it's enough to feed it with space (' ') as base DN -
ldap_search($ds, ' ', '(...filter...)', ...
===============================================================================

A previous comment noted: "I've also noticed that the departmentNumber,
employeeNumber (and maybe others in inetorgperson.schema) are not returned from
a search."

This is incorrect. These attributes are returned, but you must reference them
with lowercase names. That is, instead of doing this:

$entries[0]["departmentNumber"][0]

Do this:

$entries[0]["departmentnumber"][0]

This doesn't seem like "correct" behavior to me, but I don't know enough about
LDAP to say for sure.
===============================================================================

implode(", ",$uentry[0]["rfc822mailalias"]);

doesn't work as expected because "count" is in there... one /must/ use the
'for' loop to cycle through results (discarding "count" element).
===============================================================================

I've found that spaces need to be escaped in search filters ("\20"), at least
using the Red Hat PHP 4.1.2 package.  Otherwise no results are returned.
===============================================================================

I used the following to retrieve all entries from an ILS (Netmeeting) Server:
<p>    $sr=ldap_search($ds, "objectclass=rtperson","(&(cn=%)(objectclass=
rtperson))");
<p>Have fun!

===============================================================================

FYI, for those doing LDAP searches on Exchange servers, there seems to be some
preference in Exchange to disallow searches that aren't initial searches (i.e.
only x* will work, not * or *x). I'd been going nuts trying to figure out why I
kept getting errors doing * searches.

More info at:
http://www.microsoft.com/Exchange/en/55/help/documents/server/XOG16007.HTM
===============================================================================

Results from ActiveDirectory may be ordered by objectSid.
We can get all users for each page size by modify filter.

<?php
// ... connect to ldap
$lastsid='';
while (1) {
    $filter = '(objectClass=user)';
    if (strlen($lastsid)) {
        list($v)=array_values(unpack('V',substr($lastsid,24))); // id for user.
        $s = substr($lastsid,0,24).pack('V',1+$v); // next sid.
        $s = preg_replace('/../','\\\\$0',bin2hex($s)); // escape for fiter
        $filter = '(&'.$filter.'(objectSid>='.$s.'))'; // fiter for next
entries.
    }
    $res = ldap_search($ldap,$basedn,$filter,array('objectSid','cn'));
    if (!ldap_count_entries($ldap,$res)) {
        break;
    }
    for ($ent=ldap_first_entry($ldap,$res); $ent; $ent=ldap_next_entry($ldap,
$ent)) {
        list($lastsid) = ldap_get_values_len($ldap,$ent,'objectSid');
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

I have been working on a script where I needed to get all the users who were
member of a specific MS AD group. Because of PHP bug #42060 ( http://
bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42060 ) I could not get all the users back who were
member of the group.
After googling for a day I found an article and a patch but it required that I
downloaded the source code for php 5.1.6 or 5.2.10 run the patch and than
recompile the code to fix the problem.
Problem was
1) I am not a Linux goeroe so I was not very comfortable doing this....
2) I am running the script on a production machine with other code using PHP
and did not know what the consequence would bee for that code.
3) I could not update PHP anymore because in newer versions this patch would
probably not work any more.

But yesterday I saw the light and wrote some code to get around this problem,
maybe other people can use it that have the same problem.

<?PHP
$startFilter        = "(&(memberOf=" .$ADGroup. "))";
$startResults        = ldap_search($ldapconnect, $userBase, $startFilter, $attr

IF($countResult == 1000 OR $countResult == 1500)
{
    // loop trough the number 97-122 (ASCII number for the characters a-z)
    For($a=97;$a<=122;$a++)
    {
        // translate the number to a character
        $character            = chr($a);
        // the new search filter withs returns all users with a last name
starting with $character
        $filter            = "(&(sn=$character*)(memberOf=$ADGroup))";
        $results        = ldap_search($ldapconnect, $userBase, $filter, $attr);
        $countResult2    = ldap_count_entries($ldapconnect,$results);
           
        // See if the search for all users starting with a specific character
still hits the search limit
        // if so than do a new search to find all the users where the last name
starts with "aa" and
        // than with "ab", "ac" etc. etc
        // In the best case we can now find 675.324 users per group when the
search limit is 1000
        // ((26 * 999  for the fist character) * 26 for the second character)
        // and 1.013.324 when the search limit is 1500
        If($countResult2 == 1000 or $countResult2 == 1500)
        {
            For($b=97;$b<=122;$b++)

===============================================================================

I was doing a ldap_search with
$searchbasedn = "miDomainName=" . $_SESSION['selectDomain'] ."," .
LDAP_DOMAINBASE;
$filter = "(&(mpsAccountNumber=". $acctNumber .")(objectclass=
mpsAccountDetails))";   
$attributes = array("mpsparentchild");

$sr = ldap_search($ldapconn, $searchbasedn, $filter,$attributes); 

For some reasone this search was failing
but I was able to do successful search only when I gave the search filter as
$filter = "(&(mpsAccountNumber= $acctNumber )(objectclass=mpsAccountDetails))";
   

I did not get why the ldap_search was not able to search in the first case.

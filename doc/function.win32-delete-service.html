win32_delete_service — Deletes a service entry from the SCM database

说明

mixed win32_delete_service ( string $servicename [, string $machine ] )

Attempts to delete a service from the SCM database. Administrative privileges
are required for this to succeed.

This function really just marks the service for deletion. If other processes
(such as the Services Applet) are open, then the deletion will be deferred
until those applications are closed. If a service is marked for deletion,
further attempts to delete it will fail, and attempts to create a new service
with that name will also fail.

参数

servicename

    The short name of the service.

machine

    The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be used.

返回值

成功时返回 WIN32_NO_ERROR，参数错误时返回 FALSE，或失败时返回一个 Win32 错误码
。

范例

Example #1 A win32_delete_service() example

Deletes the dummyphp service.

<?php
win32_delete_service('dummyphp');
?>

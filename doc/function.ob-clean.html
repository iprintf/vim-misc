ob_clean — 清空（擦掉）输出缓冲区

void ob_clean ( void )

此函数用来丢弃输出缓冲区中的内容。

此函数不会销毁输出缓冲区，而像 ob_end_clean() 函数会销毁输出缓冲区。

返回值

没有返回值。

  • ob_flush() - 冲刷出（送出）输出缓冲区中的内容
  • ob_end_flush() - 冲刷出（送出）输出缓冲区内容并关闭缓冲
  • ob_end_clean() - 清空（擦除）缓冲区并关闭输出缓冲

@cornel: It's easy enough to say "Don't do that" when you think you've got the
person right in front of you. But one doesn't always have the original coder,
or even one of a dozen of the original coders. Are you really suggesting that
it would be wrong to use this function as a band-aid when the alternative may
be looking through hundreds of source files you didn't write for errors you
didn't introduce?

To your point, though, it is (or should be) a commonly accepted best practice
to not put closing PHP tags at the end of files. When, however, enforcing that
would take a time machine, it's appropriate to use ob_clean() as a band-aid to
make dynamically generated images work as expected.
===============================================================================

Don't use ob_clean() to clear white-space or other unwanted content
"accidentally" generated by included files.
Included files should not generate unwanted content in the first place.
If they do, You are doing something wrong, like inserting white-space after "?>
" (there should not be a "?>" at the end of PHP files: http://php.net/manual/en
/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php ).
===============================================================================

I find this function incredibly useful when manipulating or creating images in
php (with GD).

I spent quite a while searching through a large number of included files to
find where I had a undesired space after php's ending tag - as this was causing
all my images on the fly to break due to output already being set. Even more
annoying was that this was not caught not php's error reporting so there was no
reference to the problem line(s) in my log file. I don't know why error
reporting wouldn't catch this since it was set to accept warnings, and the same
thing had been caught in the past.

Nevertheless, I never did find the line(s) that were adding extra spaces or new
lines before my images were being generated, but what I did instead was add
this handy function right before my image manipulation code and right after the
include/require code.

For example:

<?php

// require some external library files
require ("lib/somelibrary.php");
require ("lib/class/someclass.php");

// clean the output buffer
ob_clean();

// simple test image
header("Content-type: image/gif");
$im = imagecreate (100, 50);
imagegif($im);
imagedestroy($im);

?>

While this may seem trivial a trivial use of the function, it in fact is
incredibly useful for insuring no extra spaces or new lines have already been
output while making images in php. As many of you probably already know, extra
lines, spacing and padding that appears prior to image-code will prevent the
image from being created. If the file "lib/somelibrary.php" had so much as an
extra new line after the closing php tag then it would completely prevent the
image from working in the above script.

If you work on an extremely large project with a lot of source and required
files, like myself, you will be well-advised to always clear the output buffer
prior to creating an image in php.
===============================================================================

In case there is nothing output yet to the buffer and then implementing the
ob_clean() a (soft) error notice would be generated such as the following:

Notice: ob_clean() [ref.outcontrol]: failed to delete buffer. No buffer to
delete. in [file-path]

you could do a simple check with "ob_get_contents()" to make sure that there is
anything in the buffer.

This works like magic!
I was meddling with this for hours!
Thank you.

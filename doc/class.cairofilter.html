(No version information available, might only be in Git)

A CairoFilter is used to indicate what filtering should be applied when reading
pixel values from patterns. See CairoPattern::setSource() or 
cairo_pattern_set_source() for indicating the desired filter to be used with a
particular pattern.

/* 常量 */

预定义常量

CairoFilter::FAST

    A high-performance filter, with quality similar to CairoFilter::NEAREST

CairoFilter::GOOD

    A reasonable-performance filter, with quality similar to
    CairoFilter::BILINEAR

CairoFilter::BEST

    The highest-quality available, performance may not be suitable for
    interactive use.

CairoFilter::NEAREST

    Nearest-neighbor filtering

CairoFilter::BILINEAR

    Linear interpolation in two dimensions

CairoFilter::GAUSSIAN

    This filter value is currently unimplemented, and should not be used in
    current code.

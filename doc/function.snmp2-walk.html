snmp2_walk — Fetch all the SNMP objects from an agent

说明

array snmp2_walk ( string $host , string $community , string $object_id [, 
string $timeout = 1000000 [, string $retries = 5 ]] )

snmp2_walk() function is used to read all the values from an SNMP agent
specified by the hostname.

参数

host

    The SNMP agent (server).

community

    The read community.

object_id

    If NULL, object_id is taken as the root of the SNMP objects tree and all
    objects under that tree are returned as an array.

    If object_id is specified, all the SNMP objects below that object_id are
    returned.

timeout

    The number of microseconds until the first timeout.

retries

    The number of times to retry if timeouts occur.

返回值

Returns an array of SNMP object values starting from the object_id as root or
FALSE on error.

范例

Example #1 snm2_pwalk() Example

<?php
$a = snmp2_walk("127.0.0.1", "public", "");

foreach ($a as $val) {
    echo "$val\n";
}

?>

Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent
running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop

===============================================================================

After some testing, I have found that SNMPWalk is considerably slower than
multiple SNMPGet.

I was aiming to retrieve 6 Objects from a MIB; the device being polled was
attached via a 100mbps network link.
I decided to run SNMPGet within a loop to retrieve each Object from the
specified OID's.
As these OID's were within the same tree, I then thought about using walk as
this would consolidate the data into a single request. I then walked the tree
to get the same result.

I subsequently testing the time it took to retrieve this information via
microtime().
As a result, you can retrieve 1 walk containing 6 OID's within the same time as
requesting 18 OIDs via get.

I hope this helps someone whom is looking to speed up their SNMP requests.

I just want to point out that your class has to actually implement the
Countable interface, not just define a count method, to be able to use count
($object) and get the expected results. I.e. the first example below won't work
as expected, the second will. (The normal arrow function accessor ($object->
count()) will work fine, but that's not the kewl part :) )

<?php
//Example One, BAD :(

class CountMe
{

    protected $_myCount = 3;

    public function count()
    {
        return $this->_myCount;
    }

}

$countable = new CountMe();
echo count($countable); //result is "1", not as expected

//Example Two, GOOD :)

class CountMe implements Countable
{

    protected $_myCount = 3;

    public function count()
    {
        return $this->_myCount;
    }

}

$countable = new CountMe();
echo count($countable); //result is "3" as expected
?>

Note that arrays don't implement countable. Therefore you can't force a
countable parameter for a function if you want it also to work with native
arrays.

while

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

while 循环是 PHP 中最简单的循环类型。它和 C 语言中的 while 表现地一样。while 语
句的基本格式是：

while (expr)
    statement

while 语句的含意很简单，它告诉 PHP 只要 while 表达式的值为 TRUE 就重复执行嵌套
中的循环语句。表达式的值在每次开始循环时检查，所以即使这个值在循环语句中改变了
，语句也不会停止执行，直到本次循环结束。有时候如果 while 表达式的值一开始就是
FALSE，则循环语句一次都不会执行。

和 if 语句一样，可以在 while 循环中用花括号括起一个语句组，或者用替代语法：

while (expr):
    statement
    ...
endwhile;

下面两个例子完全一样，都显示数字 1 到 10：
<?php
/* example 1 */

$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10) {
    echo $i++;  /* the printed value would be
                    $i before the increment
                    (post-increment) */
}

/* example 2 */

$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10):
    print $i;
    $i++;
endwhile;
?>

At the end of the while (list / each) loop the array pointer will be at the
end.
This means the second while loop on that array will be skipped!

You can put the array pointer back with the reset($myArray) function.

example:

<?php
$myArray=array('aa','bb','cc','dd');
while (list ($key, $val) = each ($myArray) ) echo $val;
reset($myArray);
while (list ($key, $val) = each ($myArray) ) echo $val;
?>
===============================================================================

Just a note about using the continue statement to forego the remainder of a
loop - be SURE you're not issuing the continue statement from within a SWITCH
case - doing so will not continue the while loop, but rather the switch
statement itself.

While that may seem obvious to some, it took a little bit of testing for me, so
hopefully this helps someone else.

The speedtest is interesting. But the seemingly fastest way contains a pitfall
for beginners who just use it because it is fast and fast is cool ;)

Walking through an array with next() will cut of the first entry, as this is
the way next() works ;)

If you really need to do it this way, make sure your array contains an empty
entry at the beginning. Another way would be to use

<?php
while ($this = current($array) ){
    do_something($this);
    next($array);
}
?>

There is an impact on speed for sure but I did not test it. I would advise to
stick with conventional methods because current(),next() in while loops is too
error prone for me.
===============================================================================

A cool way to keep evaluating something until it fails a test.

<?php
while (true) {
  if ('test') { // is initial condition true
    // do something that also changes initial condition
  } else { // condition failed
    break; // leave loop
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Just a note to stuart - the reason for this behaviour is because using the
while(value = each(array)) construct increments the internal counter of the
array as its looped through. Therefore if you intend to repeat the loop, you
need to reset the counter. eg:

$one = array("10", "20", "30", "40");
$two = array("a", "b", "c", "d");

$i=0;
while($i < count($one)) {
   reset($two);
   while($a = each($two)) {
       echo $a[1]." - ".$one[$i].", ";
   }
   $i++;
  
}

This produces:

a - 10, b - 10, c - 10, d - 10, a - 20, b - 20, c - 20, d - 20, a - 30, b - 30,
c - 30, d - 30, a - 40, b - 40, c - 40, d - 40,

Due to the fact that php only interprets the necessary elements to get a
result, I found it convenient to concatenate different sql queries into one
statement:

<?php

$q1 = 'some query on a set of tables';
$q2 = 'similar query on a another set of tables';

if ( ($r1=mysql_query($q1)) && ($r2=mysql_query($q2)) ) {

     while (($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($r1))||($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($r2))) {

         /* do something with $row coming from $r1 and $r2 */

      }
   }

?>

Is strange that the manual states...
"Sometimes, if the while expression evaluates to FALSE from the very beginning,
the nested statement(s) won't even be run once. "

Because it can't be SOMETIMES

If it behaves that way, then it is a bug, because it ALWAYS must not run the
nested statement(s) even once if the WHILE expression evaluates to FALSE from
the very beginning.

Another way to exit the while loop is by using the BREAK statement.. see it in
the manual.

And if expression evaluates to NULL is the same as FALSE
while (expression evals to NULL){ }
===============================================================================

Instead of this usage;

<?php
$arr = array("orange", "banana", "apple", "raspberry");

$i = 0;
while ($i < count($arr)) {
   $a = $arr[$i];
   echo $a ."\n";
   $i++;
}
// or
$i = 0;
$c = count($arr);
while ($i < $c) {
   $a = $arr[$i];
   echo $a ."\n";
   $i++;
}
?>

This could be more efficient;

<?php
while ($a = $arr[1 * $i++]) echo $a ."\n";
?>
===============================================================================

@stuart:

There's nothing strange or unexpected about your loop's behaviour.

> So in effect the main while loop is only doing one iteration... and not 4 as
expected....

That's the wrong conclusion. The outer "while" does all four iterations.
However the "inner" loop does nothing for the second, third and fourth run.

> I think it would be good to have an explaination of this strange behaviour.

Here it is:

<?PHP
$i=0;
while($i < count($one)) {
  
   while($a = each($two)) {
       echo $a[1]." - ".$one[$i].", ";
   }
   $i++;
  
}
?>

The "problem" is your use of "each", which reached the last item after the
first iteration of the outer loop. After that, when you come back to the second
iteration with the outer loop, "each" still is at the end of the array $two.

If you add a reset($two) in front of the inner "while", you'll get the result
you expect.
===============================================================================

Talking about while, dropdown menus, and ternary operator which was mentionned
before, you can combine them to have drop menu built with a value selected
according to your wishses.

<select name="whatever">
<?php
while ($data = mysql_fetch_assoc($requeteID))
{
  $menu .= '<option value="'.$data['id'].'"';
  $menu .= ($data['id'] == $_GET['id'] ? ' selected>' :'>');
  $menu .= $data['name'].'</option>';
}
echo $menu;
?>
</select>

Therefore if you are creating a form to select data from database, and want the
form displayed when search is done to show what parameters have been chosen
that will do the trick !!

Let's say I make a search between different sports, I choose football in my
form, send my query... then displays are show, the menu will have football
selected because of the ternary operator that displays "selected>" on the
<option> ;) Enjoy ^^

If you want to traverse array, foreach() is faster than while() a little.
[Benched with PHP4.0.4pl1/Apache DSO/Linux]

i.e.
foreach ($array as $k => $v)
is a little faster than
while (list($k,$v) = each($array))

You might want to use foreach for large arrays.
===============================================================================

I made a test traversing an array (simple, but long, numeric array with numeric
keys). My test had a cycle per method, and multiplied each array element by
100.. These were my results:

******************************************************
30870 Element Array Traversing

[test_time] [BEGINS/RESETS @ time_start = 1060977996.689]
0.2373 seg later -> while (list ($key, $val) = each ($array)) ENDS

[test_time] [BEGINS/RESETS @ time_start = 1060977996.9414]
0.1916 seg later -> while (list ($key,) = each ($array))  ENDS

[test_time] [BEGINS/RESETS @ time_start = 1060977997.1513]
0.1714 seg later -> foreach ($array AS $key=>$value) ENDS

[test_time] [BEGINS/RESETS @ time_start = 1060977997.3378]
0.0255 seg later -> while ($next = next($array)) ENDS

[test_time] [BEGINS/RESETS @ time_start = 1060977997.3771]
0.1735 seg later -> foreach ($array AS $value) ENDS
**************************************************************

foreach is fatser than a while (list  - each), true.
However, a while(next) was faster than foreach.

These were the winning codes:

$array = $save;
test_time("",1);
foreach ($array AS $key=>$value)
    $array[$key] = $array[$key] * 100;
test_time("foreach (\$array AS \$key=>\$value)");

$array = $save;
test_time("",1);
reset($array);
while ($next = next($array))
{    $key = key($array);
    $array[$key] = $array[$key] * 100;
}       
test_time("while (\$next = next(\$array))");
*********************************************************
The improvement seems huge, but it isnt that dramatic in real practice. Results
varied... I have a very long bidimensional array, and saw no more than a 2 sec
diference, but on 140+ second scripts.  Notice though that you lose control of
the $key  value (unless you have numeric keys, which I tend to avoid), but it
is not always necessary. 

I generally stick to foreach. However, this time, I was getting Allowed Memory
Size Exceeded errors with Apache. Remember foreach copies the original array,
so this now makes two huge 2D arrays in memory and alot of work for Apache. If
you are getting this error, check your loops. Dont use the whole array on a
foreach. Instead get the keys and acces the cells directlly. Also, try and use
unset and Referencing on the huge arrays.

Working on your array and loops is a much better workaround than saving to
temporary tables and unsetting (much slower).
===============================================================================

While can do wonders if you need something to queue writing to a file while
something else has access to it.

Here is my simple example:

<?php

  function write ($data, $file, $write_mode="w") {
    $lock = $file . ".lock";
     // run the write fix, to stop any clashes that may occur
    write_fix($lock);
     // create a new lock file after write_fix() for this writing session
    touch( $lock );
     // write to your file
    $open = fopen($file, $write_mode);
    fwrite($open, $data);
    fclose($open);
     // kill your current lock
    unlink($lock);
  }

  function write_fix ($lock_file) {
    while( file_exists($lock_file){
      // do something in here?
      // maybe sleep for a few microseconds
      // to maintain stability, if this is going to
      // take a while ?? [just a suggestion]
    }
  }

?>

This method is not recommended for use with programs that will be needing a
good few seconds to write to a file, as the while function will eat up alot of
process cycles.  However, this method does work, and is easy to implement.  It
also groups the writing functions into one easy to use function, making life
easier. :-)
===============================================================================

I was reading the excellent post by wbryson at gmail dot com and I wanted to
just add that the ? : syntax is known as the 'ternary operator' for those who
want to learn more about it.
===============================================================================

I find it often clearer to set a simple flag ($finished) to false at the start
of the loop, and have the program set it to true when it's finished doing
whatever it's trying to do. Then the code is more self-documenting: WHILE NOT
FINISHED keep going through the loop. FINISHED EQUALS TRUE when you're done.
Here's an example. This is the code I use to generate a random filename and
ensure that there is not already an existing file with the same name. I've
added very verbose comments to it to make it clear how it works:

<?php
$finaldir = 'download';

$finished = false;                       // we're not finished yet (we just
started)
while ( ! $finished ):                   // while not finished
  $rn = rand();                          // random number
  $outfile = $finaldir.'/'.$rn.'.gif';   // output file name
  if ( ! file_exists($outfile) ):        // if file DOES NOT exist...
    $finished = true;                    // ...we are finished
  endif;
endwhile;                                // (if not finished, re-start WHILE
loop)
?>
===============================================================================

For Perl programmers, break is similar to last

while (1) {
   while(cond) {
       if (error) {
           break 2; // in perl this could have been last;
       }
   }
}
===============================================================================

This is an easy way for all you calculator creators to make it do factorials.
The code is this:

<?php
$c = ($a-1);
$d = $a;
while ($c>=1)
{
$a = ($a*$c);
$c--;
}
print (" $d! = $a");
?>

$a changes, and so does c, so we have to make a new variable, $d, for the end
statement.
===============================================================================

A note to anyone nesting a while loop inside a while loop....

Consider the example below:

$one = array("10", "20", "30", "40");
$two = array("a", "b", "c", "d");

$i=0;
while($i < count($one)) {
   
    while($a = each($two)) {
        echo $a[1]." - ".$one[$i].", ";
    }
    $i++;
   
}

This will return the following:
a - 10, b - 10, c - 10, d - 10

So in effect the main while loop is only doing one iteration... and not 4 as
expected....

Now the example below works as expected..
$i=0;
while($i < count($one)) {
   
    foreach($two as $a) {
        echo $a." - ".$one[$i]."\n";
    }
    $i++;
   
}

by returning:
a - 10, b - 10, c - 10, d - 10, a - 20, b - 20, c - 20, d - 20, a - 30, b - 30,
c - 30, d - 30, a - 40, b - 40, c - 40, d - 40

So there is clearly a difference on how while statements work in comparison to
other looping structures.

I think it would be good to have an explaination of this strange behaviour.

===============================================================================

When I was testing imap_headerinfo() with an e-mail that had multiple
recipients (multiple e-mails in to to: and/or cc: field), I noticed that
imap_headerinfo() was failing hard for me on PHP 5.2.10-2ubuntu6.4 with
Suhosin-Patch 0.9.7 (cli).

Rather than providing me an array with each and every e-mail address listed in
the to and/or cc fields, it was only providing me the first listed.  This was
disappointing.

   [to] => Array
        (  
            [0] => stdClass Object
                (  
                    [mailbox] => game
                    [host] => blunts.com
                )
        )

Luckily, there was a cool workaround to this problem:

imap_rfc822_parse_headers(imap_fetchheader( string ); which subsequentally
worked like a nice little pet would:

   [to] => Array
        (  
            [0] => stdClass Object
                (  
                    [mailbox] => game
                    [host] => blunts.com
                )
            [1] => stdClass Object
                (  
                    [mailbox] => dutch
                    [host] => masters.com
                )
        )

TL;DR:
So in other words, instead of imap_headerinfo() use imap_rfc822_parse_headers
(imap_fetchheader()).

Hope this helps anyone else that runs into this issue from now into the
future.  This post was suggested by people in #PHP on FreeNode IRC.

I'm not entirely sure why this is, but if you loop through all of the messages
in a mailbox, calling imap_header() each time, you can significantly increase
performance by calling imap_headers() first.

Compare this:
<?php
     $imap = imap_open("{my.server.com:143}INBOX", "user", "pass");
     $n_msgs = imap_num_msg($imap);
     $s = microtime(true);
     for ($i=0; $i<$n_msgs; $i++) {
          $header = imap_header($imap, $i);
     }
     $e = microtime(true);
     echo ($e - $s);
     imap_close($imap);
?>

With this:
<?php
     $imap = imap_open("{my.server.com:143}INBOX", "user", "pass");
     $n_msgs = imap_num_msg($imap);
  /****** adding this line: ******/
     imap_headers($imap)
  /***************************/
     $s = microtime(true);
     for ($i=0; $i<$n_msgs; $i++) {
          $header = imap_header($imap, $i);
     }
     $e = microtime(true);
     echo ($e - $s);
     imap_close($imap);
?>

The performance difference, as I have tested on several boxes, connecting to
several different servers, is that the second code snippet ALWAYS takes 1/2 the
time, if not less.

Perhaps it is because imap_headers() retrieves all of the messages on one
connection, whereas imap_header() has to make a new fetch request for each
message??  I'm not sure WHY it is faster if imap_headers() is called first, but
I do know that it is, so I thought I'd pass on the knowledge.  If anyone knows
why this is, please let me know....
===============================================================================

If you want to extract values from to, from, or other header elements, they are
an object and you need to loop over them i.e.

$header = imap_header($mbox, $message_id);
$from = $header->from;
foreach ($from as $id => $object) {
    $fromname = $object->personal;
    $fromaddress = $object->mailbox . "@" . $object->host;
}

Would give you two variables for the friendly from and the smtp from address

An email without a subject line will not generate the 'subject' property.

Before using the 'subject' property you should test for it.
if (property_exists($header, 'subject')) echo $header->subject;
===============================================================================

I did some testing on using imap_headerinfo() function and I am very confused
with the results.

On small mailboxes, getting data for 30 messages takes about 0.5 secs. On
mailboxes with approximately 500 messages it takes about 7 secs to retrieve
data for the same number of messages.

Why would the size of mailbox had anything to do with the time needed to
retrieve the header of the single email message? Mailboxes are on the same
account.

Next, If you measure every call to imap_headerinfo() function the result are
even stranger! First and then every 22th call to the imap_headerinfo() function
takes 10000 times more that the others. Example: the first call takes about
0.39 secs, then other 20 calls take about 0.0001 secs, then 22th call takes
about 0.47 secs, then other 20 calls about 0.00004, and so on.

After some more research there is something else that came up.

If you use:

$message_header[$i] = imap_headerinfo($mbox, $i + 1);

it takes about 0.4 secs for every 22th call and about 0.0001 sec for other
calls.

However, you would expect the same results with:

$message_header[$i] = imap_headerinfo($mbox, 30 - $i);

But, in this case it takes about 0.2 secs for every call!

The only difference here is that in the second example headers are retrieved in
the reversed message order (from the 30th to the 1st) and for some reason it
greatly affects the time needed for the operation. Strange, or is it just me?

When i try to access the same mailbox through pop3 and through imap i get
different update infomations.

1. Using imap
header->udate is not the same as strtotime($header->date)
<?php
$mBox = imap_open("{host:143/imap/novalidate-cert}INBOX}", $username, $password
); // open as imap
$header = imap_header($mBox, 1); // get first mails header
echo $header->udate;
echo strtotime($header->date);
?>

1. Using pop3
header->udate is the same as strtotime($header->date)
<?php
$mBox = imap_open("{host:110/pop3/novalidate-cert}INBOX}", $username, $password
); // open as pop3
$header = imap_header($mBox, 1); // get first mails header
echo $header->udate;
echo strtotime($header->date);
?>

I do not know why this is so, but for this reason, i use strtotime($header->
date) together with other values to create my own message-UID because this
seems to work independent from the protocol.

I had to pass the msgid as array($msgid) instead of an integer. the error
"Invalid messageID" is generated if i pass an integer.
===============================================================================

I typically use UID's to identify messages, and recently discovered that the
headers I had been pulling using this function and a message-number didn't
match the UID's. Instead of worrying about it, I just began using
imap_fetchheader() and imap_ rfc822_ parse_ headers() on its output. The only
significant difference I immediately noticed was that there is no "udate"
property, so I assigned one with the result of strtotime() on the 'date'
property.

The MongoCursorTimeoutException class

(PECL mongo >= 1.0.0)

简介

Caused by a query timing out. You can set the length of time to wait before
this exception is thrown by calling MongoCursor::timeout() on the cursor or
setting MongoCursor::$timeout. The static variable is useful for queries such
as database commands and MongoCollection::findOne(), both of which implicitly
use cursors.

MongoCommandCursor::__construct — Create a new command cursor

Description

public MongoCommandCursor::__construct ( MongoClient $connection , string $ns ,
array $command = array() )

Generally, you should not have to construct a MongoCommandCursor manually, as
there are helper functions such as MongoCollection::aggregateCursor() and 
MongoCollection::parallelCollectionScan(); however, if the server introduces
new commands that can return cursors, this constructor will be useful in the
absence of specific helper methods. You may also consider using 
MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument().

Parameters

connection

    Database connection.

ns

    Full name of the database and collection (e.g. "test.foo")

command

    Database command.

Return Values

Returns the new cursor.

Examples

Example #1 MongoCommandCursor example

<?php
$m = new MongoClient;

// Define the aggregation pipeline
$pipeline = [
    [ '$group' => [
        '_id' => '$country_code',
        'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
    ] ],
    [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
];

// Construct a MongoCommandCursor object
$cursor = new MongoCommandCursor(
    $m, // MongoClient object
    'demo.cities', // namespace
    [
        'aggregate' => 'cities',
        'pipeline' => $pipeline,
        'cursor' => [ 'batchSize' => 0 ],
    ]
);

foreach($cursor as $result) {
   …
}
?>

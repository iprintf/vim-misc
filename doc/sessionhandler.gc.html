SessionHandler::gc

(PHP 5 >= 5.4.0, PHP 7)

SessionHandler::gc — Cleanup old sessions

说明

public bool SessionHandler::gc ( int $maxlifetime )

Cleans up expired sessions. Called randomly by PHP internally when a session
starts or when session_start() is invoked. The frequency this is called is
based on the session.gc_divisor and session.gc_probability configuration
directives.

This method wraps the internal PHP save handler defined in the
session.save_handler ini setting that was set before this handler was set by 
session_set_save_handler().

If this class is extended by inheritiance, calling the parent gc method will
invoke the wrapper for this method and therefore invoke the associated internal
callback. This allows this method to be overidden and or intercepted and
filtered.

For more information on what this method is expected to do, please refer to the
documentation at SessionHandlerInterface::gc().

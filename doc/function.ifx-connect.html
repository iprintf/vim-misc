ifx_connect

(PHP 4, PHP <=5.2.0)

ifx_connect — Open Informix server connection

说明

resource ifx_connect ([ string $database [, string $userid [, string $password
]]] )

ifx_connect() establishes a connection to an Informix server.

In case a second call is made to ifx_connect() with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling ifx_close().

参数

All of the arguments are optional, and if they're missing, defaults are taken
from values supplied in php.ini (ifx.default_host for the host (Informix
libraries will use INFORMIXSERVER environment value if not defined),
ifx.default_user for user, ifx.default_password for the password (none if not
defined).

database

    The database name, as a string.

userid

    The username, as a string.

password

    The password, as a string.

返回值

Returns a connection identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

范例

Example #1 Connect to a Informix database

<?php
$conn_id = ifx_connect ("mydb@ol_srv1", "imyself", "mypassword");
?>

Here's a tip :

When i first installed the informix through the removing the ; at php_ifx.dll
and then restarted apache

then checking the phpinfo(); the connection wasn't established and i had this
error that i have to set the INFORMIXSERVER.

Work Frame : Windows XP,Apache 2.2.1 php 5.3 The ODBC was working fine and i
could connect to the informix server using the odbc connection

The problem is that the sql engine was on another machine with different
platform.

[SOLUTION]

add an environmental variable called INFORMIXSERVER with the value of the
server e.g myInformixServer which itself has an ip 192.x.x.x

You can do that on windows by right click on my computer advanced >>
environmental variables >> add new System variable >> variable name =
INFORMIXSERVER 
variable value = myInformixServer

it worked like a charm
===============================================================================

Problem with INFORMIX-Access with PHP4, WIN NT 4.0?

1. php.ini: extension=php_ifx.dll
2. Path: Informix/BIN
3. httpd.conf: PassEnv INFORMIXSERVER
                    PassEnv INFORMIXDIR
4. use the Informix-tool regcopy.exe to copy the registry settings in the
system-account.

good luck!

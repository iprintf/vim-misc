===============================================================================

setrawcookie() isn't entirely 'raw'. It will check the value for invalid
characters, and then disallow the cookie if there are any. These are the
invalid characters to keep in mind: ',;<space>\t\r\n\013\014'.

Note that comma, space and tab are three of the invalid characters. IE, Firefox
and Opera work fine with these characters, and PHP reads cookies containing
them fine as well. However, if you want to use these characters in cookies that
you set from php, you need to use header().
===============================================================================

Firefox is following the real spec and does not decode '+' to space...in fact
it further encodes them to '%2B' to store the cookie.  If you read a cookie
using javascript and unescape it, all your spaces will be turned to '+'.
To fix this problem, use setrawcookie and rawurlencode:

<?php
setrawcookie('cookie_name', rawurlencode($value), time()+60*60*24*365);
?>

The only change is that spaces will be encoded to '%20' instead of '+' and will
now decode properly.
===============================================================================

You really shouldn't use (un)serialize with cookies. An evil user could inject
ANY code in your script.
===============================================================================

After having several problems with this cookie thing, I'm using base64_encode
on the data I put into a cookie, so I can avoid problems, I had before. I tried
to set up cookie with data created by serialize() from a PHP array, but it did
not work to be able to get it back, after I modified it to use value of
base64_encode(serialize(...)) to set up the cookie, and unserialize
(base64_decode(..)) to get back the value, everything started to work.
===============================================================================

If you want to pass something and unserialize later, you should somehow sign
value to ensure evil user don't modify it.
For example, calculate hash sha1($value.$securekey) and place it to different
cookie. If cookie value mismatch hash - simple discard both.
This technique you can use in any case if you want to protect cookie from
modification, but it can't protect from deletion or from setting to other valid
cookie (old or stolen from other user).
===============================================================================

my php cookie value encode function:

<?php
function encode_cookie_value($value)
         {return strtr($value,
                       array_combine(str_split($tmp=",; \t\r\n\013\014"),
                                     array_map('rawurlencode', str_split($tmp))
                                    )
                      );
         }
setrawcookie('kk', encode_cookie_value('jk=jk?jk-/":jk;jk jk,jk'));
?>

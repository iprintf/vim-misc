QuickHashIntStringHash::delete — This method deletes am entry from the hash

说明

public bool QuickHashIntStringHash::delete ( int $key )

This method deletes an entry from the hash, and returns whether the entry was
deleted or not. Associated memory structures will not be freed immediately, but
rather when the hash itself is freed.

Elements can not be deleted when the hash is used in an iterator. The method
will not throw an exception, but simply return FALSE like would happen with any
other deletion failure.

参数

key

    The key of the entry to delete.

返回值

TRUE when the entry was deleted, and FALSE if the entry was not deleted.

范例

Example #1 QuickHashIntStringHash::delete() example

<?php
$hash = new QuickHashIntStringHash( 1024 );
var_dump( $hash->exists( 4 ) );
var_dump( $hash->add( 4, "five" ) );
var_dump( $hash->delete( 4 ) );
var_dump( $hash->exists( 4 ) );
var_dump( $hash->delete( 4 ) );
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

bool(false)
bool(true)
bool(true)
bool(false)
bool(false)

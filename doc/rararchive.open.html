(PECL rar >= 2.0.0)

RarArchive::open -- rar_open — Open RAR archive

说明

面向对象风格 (method):

public static RarArchive RarArchive::open ( string $filename [, string
$password = NULL [, callable $volume_callback = NULL ]] )

过程化风格:

RarArchive rar_open ( string $filename [, string $password = NULL [, callable
$volume_callback = NULL ]] )

Open specified RAR archive and return RarArchive instance representing it.

    Note:

    If opening a multi-volume archive, the path of the first volume should be
    passed as the first parameter. Otherwise, not all files will be shown. This
    is by design.

参数

filename

    Path to the Rar archive.

password

    A plain password, if needed to decrypt the headers. It will also be used by
    default if encrypted files are found. Note that the files may have
    different passwords in respect to the headers and among them.

volume_callback

    A function that receives one parameter – the path of the volume that was
    not found – and returns a string with the correct path for such volume or
    NULL if such volume does not exist or is not known. The programmer should
    ensure the passed function doesn't cause loops as this function is called
    repeatedly if the path returned in a previous call did not correspond to
    the needed volume. Specifying this parameter omits the notice that would
    otherwise be emitted whenever a volume is not found; an implementation that
    only returns NULL can therefore be used to merely omit such notices.

Warning

Prior to version 2.0.0, this function would not handle relative paths
correctly. Use realpath() as a workaround.

返回值

Returns the requested RarArchive instance 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

更新日志

版本             说明
3.0.0 volume_callback was added.

范例

Example #1 面向对象风格

<?php
$rar_arch = RarArchive::open('encrypted_headers.rar', 'samplepassword');
if ($rar_arch === FALSE)
    die("Failed opening file");
    
$entries = $rar_arch->getEntries();
if ($entries === FALSE)
    die("Failed fetching entries");

echo "Found " . count($entries) . " files.\n";

if (empty($entries))
    die("No valid entries found.");
    
$stream = reset($entries)->getStream();
if ($stream === FALSE)
    die("Failed opening first file");

$rar_arch->close();

echo "Content of first one follows:\n";
echo stream_get_contents($stream);

fclose($stream);
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Found 2 files.
Content of first one follows:
Encrypted file 1 contents.

Example #2 过程化风格

<?php
$rar_arch = rar_open('encrypted_headers.rar', 'samplepassword');
if ($rar_arch === FALSE)
    die("Failed opening file");
    
$entries = rar_list($rar_arch);
if ($entries === FALSE)
    die("Failed fetching entries");

echo "Found " . count($entries) . " files.\n";

if (empty($entries))
    die("No valid entries found.");
    
$stream = reset($entries)->getStream();
if ($stream === FALSE)
    die("Failed opening first file");

rar_close($rar_arch);

echo "Content of first one follows:\n";
echo stream_get_contents($stream);

fclose($stream);
?>

Example #3 Volume Callback

<?php
/* In this example, there's a volume named multi_broken.part1.rar
 * whose next volume is named multi.part2.rar */
function resolve($vol) {
    if (preg_match('/_broken/', $vol))
        return str_replace('_broken', '', $vol);
    else
        return null;
}
$rar_file1 = rar_open(dirname(__FILE__).'/multi_broken.part1.rar', null, 
'resolve');
$entry = $rar_file1->getEntry('file2.txt');
$entry->extract(null, dirname(__FILE__) . "/temp_file2.txt");
?>

===============================================================================

Note that this function does NOT eliminate the need for reverse-thinking when
designing PDFs.

Origin 0, 0 is the lower left corner. This function only MOVES this origin
(0,0) - it does not reverse the Y-axis as some people might belive and want
(including myself).
===============================================================================

Not only this function is useful if you are tired of using the lowerleft side
of the page, but it is also great if you need to rotate your page..

I have a project in which I need to rotate the page 180 due to calibration
problems.. With this function I could reset the origin and the rest of the PDF
worked just fine..

I also think that this function primarly has been mode for situations like
these...

This function can also be used as a calibration feature, though I dont do it
myself, I can think that it will work very nice if your whole document is out
of calibration for lets say 1 mm..
===============================================================================

This function is useful if you're tired of trying to deal with an axis that has
a point of origin in the lower left-hand corner of the page.  Enjoy.

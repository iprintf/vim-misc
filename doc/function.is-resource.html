I was recently trying to loop through some objects and convert them to arrays
so that I could encode them to json strings.

I was running into issues when an element of one of my objects was a
SoapClient. As it turns out, json_encode() doesn't like any resources to be
passed to it. My simple fix was to use is_resource() to determine whether or
not the variable I was looking at was a resource.

I quickly realized that is_resource() returns false for two out of the 3
resources that are typically in a SoapClient object. If the resource type is
'Unknown' according to var_dump() and get_resource_type(), is_resource()
doesn't think that the variable is a resource!

My work around for this was to use get_resource_type() instead of is_resource
(), but that function throws an error if the variable you're checking isn't a
resource.

So how are you supposed to know when a variable is a resource if is_resource()
is unreliable, and get_resource_type() gives errors if you don't pass it a
resource?

I ended up doing something like this:

<?php

function isResource ($possibleResource) { return !is_null(@get_resource_type(
$possibleResource)); }

?>

The @ operator suppresses the errors thrown by get_resource_type() so it
returns null if $possibleResource isn't a resource.

I spent way too long trying to figure this stuff out, so I hope this comment
helps someone out if they run into the same problem I did.
===============================================================================

Try this to know behavior:

<?php
function resource_test($resource, $name) {
    echo
        '[' . $name. ']',
        PHP_EOL,
        '(bool)$resource => ',
        $resource ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE',
        PHP_EOL,
        'get_resource_type($resource) => ',
        get_resource_type($resource) ?: 'FALSE',
        PHP_EOL,
        'is_resoruce($resource) => ',
        is_resource($resource) ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE',
        PHP_EOL,
        PHP_EOL
    ;
}

$resource = tmpfile();
resource_test($resource, 'Check Valid Resource');

fclose($resource);
resource_test($resource, 'Check Released Resource');

$resource = null;
resource_test($resource, 'Check NULL');
?>

It will be shown as...

[Check Valid Resource]
(bool)$resource => TRUE
get_resource_type($resource) => stream
is_resoruce($resource) => TRUE

[Check Released Resource]
(bool)$resource => TRUE
get_resource_type($resource) => Unknown
is_resoruce($resource) => FALSE

[Check NULL]
(bool)$resource => FALSE
get_resource_type($resource) => FALSE
Warning:  get_resource_type() expects parameter 1 to be resource, null given in
... on line 10
is_resoruce($resource) => FALSE

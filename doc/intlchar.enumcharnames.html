IntlChar::enumCharNames — Enumerate all assigned Unicode characters within a
range

说明

public static void IntlChar::enumCharNames ( mixed $start , mixed $limit , 
callable $callback [, int $nameChoice = IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME ] )

Enumerate all assigned Unicode characters between the start and limit code
points (start inclusive, limit exclusive) and call a function for each, passing
the code point value and the character name.

For Unicode 1.0 names, only those are enumerated that differ from the modern
names.

参数

start

    The first code point in the enumeration range.

limit

    One more than the last code point in the enumeration range (the first one
    after the range).

callback

    The function that is to be called for each character name. The following
    three arguments will be passed into it:
      □ integer $codepoint - The numeric code point value
      □ integer $nameChoice - The same value as the nameChoice parameter below
      □ string $name - The name of the character

nameChoice

    Selector for which kind of names to enumerate. Can be any of these
    constants:
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME (default)
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_10_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::EXTENDED_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_ALIAS
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_CHOICE_COUNT

返回值

没有返回值。

范例

Example #1 Enumerating over a sample range of code points

<?php
IntlChar::enumCharNames(0x2600, 0x2610, function($codepoint, $nameChoice, $name
) {
    printf("U+%04x %s\n", $codepoint, $name);
});
?>

以上例程会输出：

U+2600 BLACK SUN WITH RAYS
U+2601 CLOUD
U+2602 UMBRELLA
U+2603 SNOWMAN
U+2604 COMET
U+2605 BLACK STAR
U+2606 WHITE STAR
U+2607 LIGHTNING
U+2608 THUNDERSTORM
U+2609 SUN
U+260a ASCENDING NODE
U+260b DESCENDING NODE
U+260c CONJUNCTION
U+260d OPPOSITION
U+260e BLACK TELEPHONE
U+260f WHITE TELEPHONE

EvTimer::__construct — Constructs an EvTimer watcher object

说明

public EvTimer::__construct ( double $after , double $repeat , callable
$callback [, mixed $data = NULL [, int $priority = 0 ]] )

Constructs an EvTimer watcher object.

参数

after

    Configures the timer to trigger after after seconds.

repeat

    If repeat is 0.0 , then it will automatically be stopped once the timeout
    is reached. If it is positive, then the timer will automatically be
    configured to trigger again every repeat seconds later, until stopped
    manually.

callback

    See Watcher callbacks .

data

    Custom data associated with the watcher.

priority

    Watcher priority

返回值

Returns EvTimer object on success.

范例

Example #1 Simple timers

<?php
// Create and start timer firing after 2 seconds
$w1 = new EvTimer(2, 0, function () {
    echo "2 seconds elapsed\n";
});

// Create and launch timer firing after 2 seconds repeating each second
// until we manually stop it
$w2 = new EvTimer(2, 1, function ($w) {
    echo "is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds\n";
    echo "iteration = ", Ev::iteration(), PHP_EOL;

    // Stop the watcher after 5 iterations
    Ev::iteration() == 5 and $w->stop();
    // Stop the watcher if further calls cause more than 10 iterations
    Ev::iteration() >= 10 and $w->stop();
});

// Create stopped timer. It will be inactive until we start it ourselves
$w_stopped = EvTimer::createStopped(10, 5, function($w) {
    echo "Callback of a timer created as stopped\n";

    // Stop the watcher after 2 iterations
    Ev::iteration() >= 2 and $w->stop();
});

// Loop until Ev::stop() is called or all of watchers stop
Ev::run();

// Start and look if it works
$w_stopped->start();
echo "Run single iteration\n";
Ev::run(Ev::RUN_ONCE);

echo 
"Restart the second watcher and try to handle the same events, but don't block\
n";
$w2->again();
Ev::run(Ev::RUN_NOWAIT);

$w = new EvTimer(10, 0, function() {});
echo "Running a blocking loop\n";
Ev::run();
echo "END\n";
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

2 seconds elapsed
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 1
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 2
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 3
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 4
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 5
Run single iteration
Callback of a timer created as stopped
Restart the second watcher and try to handle the same events, but don't block
Running a blocking loop
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 8
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 9
is called every second, is launched after 2 seconds
iteration = 10
END

===============================================================================

Example of passing custom data:

<?php
// Create and start timer firing after 2 seconds with custom data
$w1 = new EvTimer(2, 0, function ($w) {
    echo "Custom data: $w->data\n";
    echo "2 seconds elapsed\n";
}, 'abcd');
Ev::run();
?>
Running this will print out:
Custom data: abcd
2 seconds elapsed

Note that 'data' is a public property of the event EvWatcher class.

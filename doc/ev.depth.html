Ev::depth — Returns recursion depth

说明

final public static int Ev::depth ( void )

The number of times Ev::run() was entered minus the number of times Ev::run()
was exited normally, in other words, the recursion depth. Outside Ev::run() ,
this number is 0 . In a callback, this number is 1 , unless Ev::run() was
invoked recursively (or from another thread), in which case it is higher.

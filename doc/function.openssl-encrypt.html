===============================================================================

Many users give up with handilng problem when openssl command line tool cant
decrypt php openssl encrypted file which is encrypted with openssl_encrypt
function.

For example how beginner is encrypting data:

<?php

$string = 'It works ? Or not it works ?';
$pass = '1234';
$method = 'aes128';

file_put_contents ('./file.encrypted', openssl_encrypt ($string, $method, $pass
));

?>

And then how beginner is trying to decrypt data from command line:

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -pass pass:123

Or even if he/she determinates that openssl_encrypt output was base64 and
tries:

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -base64 -pass pass:123

Or even if he determinates that base64 encoded file is represented in one line
and tries:

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -base64 -A -pass pass:123

Or even if he determinates that IV is needed and adds some string iv as
encryption function`s fourth parameter and than adds hex representation of iv
as parameter in openssl command line :

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -base64 -pass pass:123 -iv -iv
31323334353637383132333435363738

Or even if he determinates that aes-128 password must be 128 bits there fore 16
bytes and sets $pass = '1234567812345678' and tries:

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -base64 -pass
pass:1234567812345678 -iv -iv 31323334353637383132333435363738

All these troubles will have no result in any case.

BECAUSE THE PASSWORD PARAMETER DOCUMENTED HERE IS NOT THE PASSWORD.

It means that the password parameter of the function is not the same string
used as [-pass pass:] parameter with openssl cmd tool for file encryption
decryption.

IT IS THE KEY !

And now how to correctly encrypt data with php openssl_encrypt and how to
correctly decrypt it from openssl command line tool.

<?php

    function strtohex($x)
    {
        $s='';
        foreach (str_split($x) as $c) $s.=sprintf("%02X",ord($c));
        return($s);
    }
   
    $source = 'It works !';

    $iv = "1234567812345678";
    $pass = '1234567812345678';
    $method = 'aes-128-cbc';

    echo "\niv in hex to use: ".strtohex ($iv);
    echo "\nkey in hex to use: ".strtohex ($pass);
    echo "\n";

    file_put_contents ('./file.encrypted',openssl_encrypt ($source, $method, 
$pass, true, $iv));

    $exec = "openssl enc -".$method." -d -in file.encrypted -nosalt -nopad -K "
.strtohex($pass)." -iv ".strtohex($iv);

    echo 'executing: '.$exec."\n\n";
    echo exec ($exec);
    echo "\n";

?>

IV and Key parameteres passed to openssl command line must be in hex
representation of string.

The correct command for decrypting is:

# openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in file.encrypted -nosalt -nopad -K
31323334353637383132333435363738 -iv 31323334353637383132333435363738

As it has no salt has no padding and by setting functions third parameter we
have no more base64 encoded file to decode. The command will echo that it
works...

: /
===============================================================================

Beware of the padding this method adds !

<?php
$encryption_key = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32);
$iv = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(16);
$data = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32);

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
$data = openssl_encrypt($data, 'aes-256-cbc', $encryption_key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA
, $iv);
echo strlen($data) . "\n";
}
?>

With this sample the output will be:
48
64
80
96
112

This is because our $data is already taking all the block size, so the method
is adding a new block which will contain only padded bytes.

The only solution that come to my mind to avoid this situation is to add the
option OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING along with the first one:
<?php
$data = openssl_encrypt($data, 'aes-256-cbc', $encryption_key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA
|OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING, $iv);
?>

/!\ Be careful when using this option, be sure that you provide data that have
already been padded or that takes already all the block size.
===============================================================================

Since the $options are not documented, I'm going to clarify what they mean here
in the comments.  Behind the scenes, in the source code for /ext/openssl/
openssl.c:

    EVP_EncryptInit_ex(&cipher_ctx, NULL, NULL, key, (unsigned char *)iv);
    if (options & OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING) {
        EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(&cipher_ctx, 0);
    }

And later:

        if (options & OPENSSL_RAW_DATA) {
            outbuf[outlen] = '\0';
            RETVAL_STRINGL((char *)outbuf, outlen, 0);
        } else {
            int base64_str_len;
            char *base64_str;

            base64_str = (char*)php_base64_encode(outbuf, outlen, &
base64_str_len);
            efree(outbuf);
            RETVAL_STRINGL(base64_str, base64_str_len, 0);
        }

So as we can see here, OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING has a direct impact on the OpenSSL
context.  EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() enables or disables padding (enabled by
default).  So, OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING disables padding for the context, which
means that you will have to manually apply your own padding out to the block
size.  Without using OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING, you will automatically get PKCS#7
padding.

OPENSSL_RAW_DATA does not affect the OpenSSL context but has an impact on the
format of the data returned to the caller.  When OPENSSL_RAW_DATA is specified,
the returned data is returned as-is.  When it is not specified, Base64 encoded
data is returned to the caller.

Hope this saves someone a trip to the PHP source code to figure out what the
$options do.  Pro developer tip:  Download and have a copy of the PHP source
code locally so that, when the PHP documentation fails to live up to quality
expectations, you can see what is actually happening behind the scenes.
===============================================================================

Just a couple of notes about the parameters:

data - It is interpreted as a binary string
method - Regular string, make sure you check openssl_get_cipher_methods() for a
list of the ciphers available in your server*
password - As biohazard mentioned before, this is actually THE KEY! It should
be in hex format.
options - As explained in the Parameters section
iv - Initialization Vector. Different than biohazard mentioned before, this
should be a BINARY string. You should check for your particular implementation.

To verify the length/format of your IV, you can provide strings of different
lengths and check the error log. For example, in PHP 5.5.9 (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS),
providing a 32 byte hex string (which would represent a 16 byte binary IV)
throws an error.
"IV passed is 32 bytes long which is longer than the 16 expected by the
selected cipher" (cipher chosen was 'aes-256-cbc' which uses an IV of 128 bits,
its block size).
Alternatively, you can use openssl_cipher_iv_length().

From the security standpoint, make sure you understand whether your IV needs to
be random, secret or encrypted. Many times the IV can be non-secret but it has
to be a cryptographically secure random number. Make sure you generate it with
an appropriate function like openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(), not mt_rand().

*Note that the available cipher methods can differ between your dev server and
your production server! They will depend on the installation and compilation
options used for OpenSSL in your machine(s).
===============================================================================

The list of methods for this function can be obtained with
openssl_get_cipher_methods();
The password can be encrypted with the openssl_private/public_encrypt()
===============================================================================

PHP OpenSSL functions openssl_encrypt() and openssl_decrypt() seem to use PKCS5
/7 style padding for all symmetric ciphers. Upon this, you can't use them to
encrypt using null byte padding or to decrypt null byte padded data.

The developers of the wrapper forgot the padding scheme flags... :(
===============================================================================

There's a lot of confusion plus some false guidance here on the openssl
library.

The basic tips are:

aes-256-ctr is arguably the best choice for cipher algorithm as of 2016. This
avoids potential security issues (so-called padding oracle attacks) and bloat
from algorithms that pad data to a certain block size. aes-256-gcm is
preferable, but not usable until the openssl library is enhanced, which is due
in PHP 7.1

Use different random data for the initialisation vector each time encryption is
made with the same key. mcrypt_create_iv() is one choice for random data. AES
uses 16 byte blocks, so you need 16 bytes for the iv.

Join the iv data to the encrypted result and extract the iv data again when
decrypting.

Pass OPENSSL_RAW_DATA for the flags and encode the result if necessary after
adding in the iv data.

Hash the chosen encryption key (the password parameter) using openssl_digest()
with a hash function such as sha256, and use the hashed value for the password
parameter.

There's a simple Cryptor class on GitHub called php-openssl-cryptor that
demonstrates encryption/decryption and hashing with openssl, along with how to
produce and consume the data in base64 and hex as well as binary. It should lay
the foundations for better understanding and making effective use of openssl
with PHP.

Hopefully it will help anyone looking to get started with this powerful
library.
===============================================================================

Contrary to some of the other comments here, I'm not certain that Password is
indeed being improperly treated as the direct key.  I say this because I've
been passing random text values into this parameter which would be invalid as
hex input.  It seems to be hashing the password I provide, using what algorithm
I do not know, because otherwise I'd expect it to throw an exception instead of
working as expected.

That said, I'm using openssl_decrypt() to decrypt data that was only encrypted
with openssl_encrypt().  I've not had to try to decrypt data where I do know
for certain what the direct key is to know if I have an issue with bad pad
blocks or any other exceptions which would indicate a key mismatch.
===============================================================================

Might be useful to people trying to use 'aes-256-cbc' cipher (and probably
other cbc ciphers) in collaboration with other implementations of AES (C libs
for example) that the openssl extension has a strict implementation regarding
padding bytes. I found the solution only by manually going through the openssl
source.

In C, you would want to pad plaintexts the following way (assuming all mem
allocations are proper):

nPadding = ( 16 - ( bufferSize % 16 ) ) ? ( 16 - ( bufferSize % 16 ) ) : 16;
for( index = bufferSize; index < bufferSize + nPadding; index++ )
{
    plaintext[ index ] = (char)nPadding;
}

while decryptions are validated like:

isSuccess = TRUE;
for( index = bufferSize - 1; index > ( bufferSize - nPadding ); index-- )
{
    if( plaintext[ index ] != nPadding )
    {
        isSuccess = FALSE;
        break;
    }
}
decryptedSize = bufferSize - nPadding;

In plain english, the buffer must be padded up to blockSize. If the buffer is
already a multiple of blockSize, you add an entire new blockSize bytes as
padding.

The value of the padding bytes MUST be the number of padding bytes as a byte...

So 5 bytes of padding will result in the following bytes added at the end of
the ciphertext:
[ 0x05 ][ 0x05 ][ 0x05 ][ 0x05 ][ 0x05 ]

Hope this saves someone else a few hours of their life.
===============================================================================

Note, that if you don't specify the ...RAW_DATA  option, then you get a base64
encoded result.  I lost a few hours because my PHP didn't have the
OPENSSL_RAW_DATA constant, and after I'd carefully base64 encoded the result,
it just wasn't decoding...
===============================================================================

Be advised there was a memory leak in this function: https://bugs.php.net/
bug.php?id=54060.  I believe this got fixed in 5.3.6, but on production
webservers running 5.3.5 with modest traffic, this became  a memory hemorrhage
that brought my site down.  Look at mcrypt_encrypt instead.
===============================================================================

In 5.3.3 they added a new parameter, string $iv (initialization vector)
Real parameters are:
string openssl_encrypt ( string $data , string $method , string $password, bool
$raw_output = false, string $iv )

If $iv is missing, a warning is issued: "Using an empty Initialization Vector
(iv) is potentially insecure and not recommended".

If $iv is too short, another warning:
"IV passed is only 3 bytes long, cipher expects an IV of precisely 8 bytes,
padding with \0"

same IV should be used in openssl_decrypt()
===============================================================================

For security reasons, if NOT  encrypting using a (cryptographically) random IV,
then the IV itself must be entryptet as well ( this is not handled behind the
scene).
the reason is that it leads to predictable IV's, which then breaks semantic
security. [this kind of attack can already be done on ssl/ TLS 1.1].

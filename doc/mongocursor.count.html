MongoCursor::count

(PECL mongo >=0.9.2)

MongoCursor::count — Counts the number of results for this query

说明

public int MongoCursor::count ([ bool $foundOnly = FALSE ] )

This method does not affect the state of the cursor: if you haven't queried
yet, you can still apply limits, skips, etc. If you have started iterating
through results, it will not move the current position of the cursor. If you
have exhasted the cursor, it will not reset it.

参数

foundOnly

    Send cursor limit and skip information to the count function, if
    applicable.

返回值

The number of documents returned by this cursor's query.

范例

Example #1 MongoCursor::count() example

<?php

$collection->insert(array('x'=>1));
$collection->insert(array('x'=>2));
$collection->insert(array('x'=>3));

$cursor = $collection->find();

var_dump($cursor->count());
var_dump($cursor->count(true));

$cursor->limit(2);

var_dump($cursor->count());
var_dump($cursor->count(true));

?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

int(3)
int(3)
int(3)
int(2)

错误／异常

Throws MongoConnectionException if it cannot reach the database.

It should be noted that for extreme geographical locations date_sun_info()
might return unexpected values. Values of 1 or empty may be returned. If you
are expecting a unix timestamp this will default to the epoch, or epoch+1,
which is not what you would expect.

After researching official almanac records for these locations it appears
likely that for sunrise and sunset return values of 1 relate to a situation
where the sun is above the horizon for the entire 24 hour day. It is also
possible that empty return values relate to a situation where the sun is below
the horizon for the entire 24 hour day. In the case of twilight data a 1
probably means that the sun never dips below that zenith, and an empty value
means the sun never rises above said zenith for that given day.

The following code exhibits unique dates from the northernmost city Ny-Ålesund,
Svalbard, and the southernmost city McMurdo Research Station, Antarctica.

<?php

$northernmost_city_latitude = 78.92;   // Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard
$northernmost_city_longitude = 11.93;
$southernmost_city_latitude = -77.88;  // McMurdo Research Station, Antarctica
$southernmost_city_longitude = 166.73;

print_r( date_sun_info( strtotime("2008-01-01") , $northernmost_city_latitude, 
$northernmost_city_longitude) );
print_r( date_sun_info( strtotime("2008-04-01") , $northernmost_city_latitude, 
$northernmost_city_longitude) );
print_r( date_sun_info( strtotime("2008-01-01") , $southernmost_city_latitude, 
$southernmost_city_longitude) );
print_r( date_sun_info( strtotime("2008-06-01") , $southernmost_city_latitude, 
$southernmost_city_longitude) );

?>

This will return the following. Observe that sometimes a value of 1 or empty is
returned.

I have been working on my own php script to get current down or up for sun and
moon.   I had to add function for any places that have 24 hour sun. 

here is my code for places with 24 hour sun.

<?php
   if ($sunrise == 0 && $sunset == 0) {
   $sunrise24 = "";
   $sunset24 = "";
   //run suninfo
   $sunup = date_sun_info(strtotime($year."-".$month."-".$day), $lat, $lon);
   }

//check if sun is up all day.
if ($sunup[sunrise] == 1 && $sunup[sunrise] == 1) {
imagecopy($sky, $sun, 60, 20, 0, 0, $sun_width, $sun_height);
imagefill($sky, 0, 0, $bluesky);
}
?>
===============================================================================

While the bug has been fixed in future versions, be aware that in some PHP
versions around 5.1-5.2 have a situation where the latitude and longitude are
read in reverse. This will cause the output to be for a completely different
location on Earth.

array date_sun_info ( int $time , float $latitude , float $longitude )
wrongly becomes
array date_sun_info ( int $time , float $longitude, float $latitude)

Make sure you do a double check before deploying this function to a live state,
and verify against date_sunrise() or date_sunset() that you don't have to put
the location's real longitude in the function's latitude parameter and vice
versa.

Just to reiterate, THIS HAS BEEN FIXED! But in some versions of PHP that may be
out there on shared hosting solutions, you may be getting odd results, and this
will most likely be the reason. I hope this helps others that are searching for
a solution quickly.
===============================================================================

In extreme regions, the return value might be true or false. true means the
event will always occur, e.g. the sun always has a positive elevation. false
means the event will never occur, e.g. the sun has always a negative elevation.

We needed the length of the day, both sunrise to sunset and twilight to
twilight for particular latitudes. Sun_info() is just the thing. We mistakenly
thought 'transit' was this value, which it is not. Transit is the time of day
the sun is at its zenith. To get length of day, one must perform math on the
results of sun_info().

When doing math with time values, don't expect date() to do the conversion to
hours:minutes:seconds. date() thinks the passed value is a time since the
epoch. You will need to do your own conversion to hours:minutes:seconds, using
something like the following:
<?php
function hms($val) {
// convert seconds to hours:minutes:seconds
$v=$val;
$h=intval($v/3600);
$v-=($h*3600); // subtract hours
$m=intval($v/60);
$v-=($m*60); // subtract minutes
$s=$v % 60; // seconds remaining
if ($h<10) {$h="0".$h;}
if ($m<10) {$m="0".$m;}
if ($s<10) {$s="0".$s;}
return $h.":".$m.":".$s;
}
?>

Regarding date_sunrise() and date_sunset(), these both return values without
seconds and without correction for Daylight time. Whereas sun_info() handles
seconds as well as Daylight time. It even handles dates prior to the epoch
correctly as negative timestamps, at least as of php 5.2.12

For example,
sun_info(strtotime('July 4, 1776'),47.3506,-122.6417)
produces something like the following when using date_default_timezone_set
('America/Los_Angeles') and
date("H:i:s", $val)

sunrise: 04:20:26 [-6106016374]
sunset: 20:09:03 [-6105959457]
transit: 12:14:45 [-6105987915]
civil_twilight_begin: 03:40:54 [-6106018746]
civil_twilight_end: 20:48:35 [-6105957085]
nautical_twilight_begin: 02:46:58 [-6106021982]
nautical_twilight_end: 21:42:31 [-6105953849]
astronomical_twilight_begin: 01:28:06 [-6106026714]
astronomical_twilight_end: 23:01:23 [-6105949117]

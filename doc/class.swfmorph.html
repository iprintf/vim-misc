The SWFMorph class

(PHP 5 <= 5.3.0, PECL ming SVN)

简介

The methods here are sort of weird. It would make more sense to just have
newSWFMorph(shape1, shape2);, but as things are now, shape2 needs to know that
it's the second part of a morph. (This, because it starts writing its output as
soon as it gets drawing commands- if it kept its own description of its shapes
and wrote on completion this and some other things would be much easier.)

类摘要

SWFMorph {
/* 方法 */
__construct ( void )

===============================================================================

setLine() is mandatory for shape got with getShape1 and getShape2, otherwise
you will get a "failed assertion"
===============================================================================

If you call getShape1() twize (by mistake, when copy-pasting). ming-0.3_beta1
will segfault.

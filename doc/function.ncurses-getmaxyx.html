TIP 1: If you want to know the size of the main (default) ncurses screen, you
can use the defined constant STDSCR
eg. ncurses_getmaxyx (STDSCR, $Height, $Width);
No need to create a window, get its size and delete it again (not sure if this
works on php versions < 5 though).

TIP 2 : If you are creating a PHP console application and want to support
terminal resizing and if you find that the ncurses screen doesn't actually
resize when you resize your terminal (which was the case for me (on FreeBSD 5.3
at least)) you should end the current ncurses session and restart it again.
Very easy to do this if you create your own ncurses class with a nice con- and
destructor.

After some headscratching as to why my script was not detecting the terminal
being resized... i discovered that the function would not report the new size
of the terminal until the window is refreshed.
So this is the code that I am using to get the size of the screen:

$fullscreen = ncurses_newwin ( 0, 0, 0, 0);

// everytime you want to find out the size of the screen, write the following 2
lines:
ncurses_wrefresh($fullscreen);
ncurses_getmaxyx ($fullscreen, $y, $x );

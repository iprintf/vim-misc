MongoCursor::fields — Sets the fields for a query

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::fields ( array $f )

Fields are specified by "fieldname" : bool. TRUE indicates that a field should
be returned, FALSE indicates that it should not be returned. You can also use 1
and 0 instead of TRUE and FALSE.

Thus, to return only the "summary" field, one could say:

<?php

$cursor->fields(array("summary" => true));

?>

To return all fields except the "hidden" field:

<?php

$cursor->fields(array("hidden" => false));

?>

参数

f

    Fields to return (or not return).

返回值

Returns this cursor.

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if this cursor has started iterating or a scalar
argument is given.

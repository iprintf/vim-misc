范例

Example #1 使用 LDAP Bind

<?php

// using ldap bind
$ldaprdn  = 'uname';     // ldap rdn or dn
$ldappass = 'password';  // associated password

// connect to ldap server
$ldapconn = ldap_connect("ldap.example.com")
    or die("Could not connect to LDAP server.");

if ($ldapconn) {

    // binding to ldap server
    $ldapbind = ldap_bind($ldapconn, $ldaprdn, $ldappass);

    // verify binding
    if ($ldapbind) {
        echo "LDAP bind successful...";
    } else {
        echo "LDAP bind failed...";
    }

}

?>

Example #2 Using LDAP Bind Anonymously

<?php

//using ldap bind anonymously

// connect to ldap server
$ldapconn = ldap_connect("ldap.example.com")
    or die("Could not connect to LDAP server.");

if ($ldapconn) {

    // binding anonymously
    $ldapbind = ldap_bind($ldapconn);

    if ($ldapbind) {
        echo "LDAP bind anonymous successful...";
    } else {
        echo "LDAP bind anonymous failed...";
    }

}

?>

===============================================================================

Interesting point,

if you can't bind to active directory with the error "49: Invalid Credentials",
you can get the extended error output from the ldap_get_option function, using
the option: LDAP_OPT_DIAGNOSTIC_MESSAGE. Unfortunately php hasn't defined this
by default, but it's value is 0x0032.

This is useful if a user must change their password at first login (Data: 773),
or if their account has expired on the network (Data: 532).

<?php

define(LDAP_OPT_DIAGNOSTIC_MESSAGE, 0x0032)

$handle = ldap_connect('ldap://active.directory.server/');
$bind = ldap_bind($handle, 'user', 'expiredpass');

if ($bind) {
    if (ldap_get_option($handle, LDAP_OPT_DIAGNOSTIC_MESSAGE, $extended_error))
{
        echo "Error Binding to LDAP: $extended_error";
    } else {
        echo "Error Binding to LDAP: No additional information is available.";
    }
}
?>

Or something to that effect..

It took me a while to work this one out, so i figured i'd share my results..
===============================================================================

I couldn't get ldap_bind to work on an ldaps connection until I followed some
instructions about creating an ldap.conf file.  I don't see these instructions
anywhere on the php site.  Maybe they're on the OpenLDAP site, but I thought it
would be useful to have here as well.  Credit goes to a dude known as 'LRM',
and I found my solution here: http://lists.horde.org/archives/sork/

1. create C:\OpenLDAP\sysconf\ldap.conf (Yes, it MUST be this path because it's
hard-coded in the dll)
2. put this line at the top:

TLS_REQCERT never

3. Save, stop/start apache.

The reason is, I think, because it doesn't understand the certificate, so this
directive tells it to not bother checking it.  I guess that could be unsafe in
some cases, but in my case I'm confident with the server I'm connecting to.

My connection code was as follows (nothing new here, I don't think):

<?php
$con = @ldap_connect('ldaps://the.ldap.server', 636);
ldap_set_option($con, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
ldap_set_option($con, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);
var_dump(@ldap_bind($con, 'user@sub.domain.com', 'password'));
?>

Good luck!  LDAPS can be a real bitch.
===============================================================================

A number of examples and implementations of authentication schemes which use
LDAP simple binds to authenticate users fail to properly sanitize
user-submitted data. This can allow for an anonymous user to authenticate to a
web-based application as an existing user. Provided below is a brief
description and example of how this vulnerability can arise. For more detailed
information please visit the links at the bottom of this posting.

The bind operation of LDAP, as described in RFC 4513, provides a method which
allows for authentication of users. For the Simple Authentication Method a user
may use the anonymous authentication mechanism, the unauthenticated
authentication mechanism, or the name/password authentication mechanism. The
unauthenticated authentication mechanism is used when a client who desires to
establish an anonymous authorization state passes a non-zero length
distinguished name and a zero length password. Most LDAP servers either can be
configured to allow this mechanism or allow it by default. Web-based
applications which perform the simple bind operation with the client's
credentials are at risk when an anonymous authorization state is established.
This can occur when the web-based application passes a distinguished name and a
zero length password to the LDAP server.
This is commonly encountered when no password is provided from the client to
the web-based application. This situation is described in some of the postings
found below. For this situation, the recommendations found in other postings is
sufficient to prevent authentication bypass.
However, no prior postings at php.net describe a situation in which a client
may pass a distinguished username and a password of non-zero length to the
web-based application which results in an anonymous authorization state. Below
is an example of this situation.

$dn="testuser";
$pass="\x00\x41";
if (empty($dn) or empty($pass)) { exit(); } //check for empty strings
//if (preg_match('/[^a-zA-Z]/',$dn) or preg_match('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\x20!@#$%^&*()]/
',$pass)) { exit(); } //check for expected values (whitelisting)
//if (preg_match('/\x00/',$dn) or preg_match('/\x00/',$pass)) { exit(); } //
check for null byte (blacklisting)
$ldapconn=ldap_connect("192.0.2.2") or die("Could not connect to LDAP
server.");
if ($ldapconn) {
        ldap_set_option($ldapconn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
        $ldapbind=ldap_bind($ldapconn, $dn, $pass);
        if ($ldapbind) {
                echo("success");
        } else {
                echo("fail");
                }
        }

Note that you have to specify the protocol version prior to making a call to
ldap_bind, when the server is expecting LDAP protocol version 3.  If you do
not, you will receive a warning and fail to bind, such as:

ldap_bind(): Unable to bind to server: Protocol error

In order to avoid this, make this call:

<?php
ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
?>

Where $ds is the result returned by ldap_connect(...);
===============================================================================

GnuTLS and SChannel (Microsoft) implementations are not (yet) compatible for
TLS 1.2 negotiation during LDAPS binding (when binding with Microsoft Windows
2012R2 server).

The trick is to disable TLS1.2 before using LDAP functions:

putenv(‘LDAPTLS_CIPHER_SUITE=NORMAL:!VERS-TLS1.2’);
===============================================================================

Due to a bug in PHP 5.3 you may have to place the ldap.conf in the root of all
your drives (I had to place it on D:).

See http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48866
===============================================================================

When using LDAP with SSL and a LDAP server which uses a self-signed SSL
certificate normally no connection will be established. Therefor you have to
allow such connections explicitly.
With Linux (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu) you have to add "TLS_REQCERT never" to your /
etc/ldap/ldap.conf. On other distributions this config file may be located
somewhere else.

After a lot of trail and error i've found the way to authenticate to apple's
Opendirectory (snow leopard server) and thought it maybe useful to share.

<?php
    // using ldap bind
    $ldaprdn  = 'uid=USERNAME,cn=users,dc=HOSTNAME,dc=DOMAIN,dc=com';     //
ldap rdn or dn
    $ldappass = 'PASSWORD';  // associated password

    // connect to ldap server
    $ldapconn = ldap_connect("HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.com")
            or die("Could not connect to LDAP server.");

    // Set some ldap options for talking to
    ldap_set_option($ldapconn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
    ldap_set_option($ldapconn, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);

    if ($ldapconn) {

            // binding to ldap server
            $ldapbind = @ldap_bind($ldapconn, $ldaprdn, $ldappass);

            // verify binding
            if ($ldapbind) {
                echo "LDAP bind successful...\n";
            } else {
                echo "LDAP bind failed...\n";
            }

    }

Hey

I was trying this all day and final noticed that when you use bind and
authenticate. The user name needs to be as follows for it to work. I am using
PHP V 4.03 so this might be different now but here is what I used and the auth
worked.

<?php
$ldaphost = "ldap.what.at.greatnet.com";
$ldapport = 389;

$ds = ldap_connect($ldaphost, $ldapport)
or die("Could not connect to $ldaphost");

if ($ds)
{
    $username = "johndoe@what.at.greatnet.com";
    $upasswd = "pass";

    $ldapbind = ldap_bind($ds, $username, $upasswd);
                              
    if ($ldapbind)
        {print "Congratulations! $username is authenticated.";}
    else
        {print "Nice try, kid. Better luck next time!";}
}

?>
===============================================================================

I had a problem doing a ldap_bind over SSL against Active Directory. The server
kept telling me: 'Unable to bind to server:'. To solve this (OS: CentOS 6) make
sure that /etc/openldap/ldap.conf has this line:

TLS_REQCERT allow
===============================================================================

If you're using SSL (e.g. ldaps) and ldap_bind is throwing 'Unable to bind to
server:' errors, check that the hostname used in the ldap_connect matches the
'CN' in the SSL certificate on the LDAP server. For example:

<?
   ldap_connect('ldaps://ldap01');
  // 'ldap01' should match the CN in your LDAP server's SSL cert, otherwise the
subsequent ldap_bind() will throw a bind error

?>

You can check your LDAP server's SSL cert using Openssl utility (Linux) - look
for the 'Subject' line:

   $ openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/tls/certs/ldap01.crt -text -noout
   ...
        Subject: C=XY, ST=My State, L=My City, O=My Org, CN=ldap01/emailAddress
=me@domain.com
   ...

I recently applied some updates to my system (now Centos 5.7 and PHP 5.3.6) and
started having this issue with PHP scripts that had been fine previously where
I was simply using the IP address of the server. Replacing the IP address with
the hostname fixed my issue.
===============================================================================

It seems that Active Directory stores information in UTF8 format.

I needed to utf8_encode() the username and password otherwise the bind failed
when a user has accented characters in his password...
===============================================================================

As "john dot lewis at waldenweb dot com" correctly writes (and this is
important to note and SHOULD be incorporated into the documentation as a
warning - trying to bind with specific username and empty password will return
TRUE.
===============================================================================

In some structures its not possible to know the dn or rdn up front. However one
can use $ldapuser= $samaccountname.'@'.domainname;
===============================================================================

If you are still having trouble after following all the instructions on the Web
to get LDAPS to work, here's what worked for me:

I was trying to do LDAPS connection (our LDAP server was using port 40636) by
running following command:

ldap_connect("www.example.com",40636)

This didn't work for days till I changed it to the following format:

ldap_connect("ldaps://www.example.com:40636")

Hope it'll help some out there.

It's nessesary to add:

<?php
ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)
?>

for ldap_bind returned true, while you try to bind for openldap (at least
version 2.4.21)
===============================================================================

Hi All, I just thought people should realize that the bug, or whatever change
that was implemented with slapd and Openldap for the version V3 protocol has
either not been repaired, or isn;t believed to be a bug or whatever...but still
requires an implicit setting to V3 for use of the ldap_bind function. I am
using Apache 2 and PHP 5.1 with LDAP 2. The default is set to deny V2 protocol,
and even reconfiguring the slapd config file will not fix the problem.

You must still use the ldap_set_option function.

EX:

<?php
    $ldapHost = "ldap://server";
        $ldapPort = "port";
    $ldapUser ="cn=name,dc=domain";
    $ldapPswd ="password";

$ldapLink =ldap_connect($ldapHost, $ldapPort)
    or die("Can't establish LDAP connection");

if (ldap_set_option($ldapLink,LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION,3))
{
    echo "Using LDAP v3";
}else{
    echo "Failed to set version to protocol 3";
}

ldap_bind($ldapLink,$ldapUser,$ldapPswd)
    or die("Can't bind to server.");

?>

Thanks to Ken on below for showing the way. There was a slight code error in
what he chose as his link_id, but thats all. This code above worked nice and
shinny, and demonstrates we are still working with 2004 problems. I wish they
would update this in the code above.
===============================================================================

Set timeout for ldap_bind:

<?php
$ld = ldap_connect("ldap.example.com");
ldap_set_option($ld, LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT, 10);
/* 10 second timeout */
ldap_bind($ld);
?>

ref. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42837
===============================================================================

When using Active Directory 2003 (possibly also 2000) you can't search
anonymously so you have to bind with a (known) user and password. Or else you
will get an Search operations error. I also can confirm that an empty password
bind succeeds! So test for an empty password first!

Some excellent information is found here:
http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~jphb/sst/php/extra/ldap.html
http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~jphb/sst/basics/ldap.html
===============================================================================

Getting an error "Can't contact LDAP server"
Solved by adding:
TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/openldap/cacerts
TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/ssl/cacert.pem
===============================================================================

You should NOT attempt to bind with a made up password.  However small the
chance, the chance remains that your code produces a valid password.  The
correct behaviour is to test for an empty password, and if your application
will only service authenticated users, not perform any more LDAP operations on
behalf of the user - this also happens to be more efficient.
===============================================================================

LDAP control support is missing from this implementation. Response controls
might be part of the response(s) to the BIND request and must be handled in
code.
===============================================================================

I'm using OpenLDAP on linux and found out the right bind sequence the hard
way... so I'm sharing it with you:

(wkaiser solution is ok if everything works fine, but for development I would
suggest using ldap_error command like this)

<?php
$ldapconfig['host'] = '10.10.10.10';
$ldapconfig['port'] = NULL;
$ldapconfig['basedn'] = 'dc=company,dc=com';

$ds=ldap_connect($ldapconfig['host'], $ldapconfig['port']);

$dn="uid=".$username.",ou=people,".$ldapconfig['basedn'];

if ($bind=ldap_bind($ds, $dn, $password)) {
  echo("Login correct");
} else {

  echo("Unable to bind to server.</br>");

  echo("msg:'".ldap_error($ds)."'</br>");#check if the message isn't: Can't
contact LDAP server :)
  #if it say something about a cn or user then you are trying with the wrong
$dn pattern i found this by looking at OpenLDAP source code :)
  #we can figure out the right pattern by searching the user tree
  #remember to turn on the anonymous search on the ldap server
  if ($bind=ldap_bind($ds)) {

    $filter = "(cn=*)";

    if (!($search=@ldap_search($ds, $ldapconfig['basedn'], $filter))) {
      echo("Unable to search ldap server<br>");
      echo("msg:'".ldap_error($ds)."'</br>");#check the message again
    } else {
      $number_returned = ldap_count_entries($ds,$search);
      $info = ldap_get_entries($ds, $search);
      echo "The number of entries returned is ". $number_returned."<p>";
      for ($i=0; $i<$info["count"]; $i++) {

        var_dump($info[$i]);#look for your user account in this pile of junk
and apply the whole pattern where you build $dn to match exactly the ldap tree
entry
      }
    }
  } else {
    echo("Unable to bind anonymously<br>");
    echo("msg:".ldap_error($ds)."<br>");
  }
}
?>

as you can see most of the examples use "cn=username" and OpenLDAP uses "uid=
username" but who knows what will be used in the future builds, this code will
help you check it out (I hope :)
===============================================================================

I tried using putenv() to point LDAP to the certificate path etc.

putenv("TLS_CACERT=/path/to/certificate");
putenv("TLS_REQCERT=never");

This did not work for me. It has to be in the Apache configuration or LDAP
configuration:

LDAP CONFIGURATION

Put these values in ldap.conf:

TLS_CACERT /path/to/certificate
TLS_REQCERT never

The path varies on UNIX systems.

On Windows it is C:\openldap\sysconf\ldap.conf

APACHE CONFIGURATION

Add these values to httpd.conf:

LDAPTrustedGlobalCert <encryption method> /path/to/certificate
LDAPVerifyServerCert Off

The encryption method I was using was 'CA_BASE64'. Check the encryption method
with your LDAP/AD sysadmin.
===============================================================================

Just a quick and easy function to authenticate against an AD domain controller:

<?php
function ad_auth( $server, $username, $password ){
        $ldap = @ldap_connect( $server );

        if ( @ldap_bind( $ldap, $username, $password ) ){
                ldap_unbind( $ldap );
                return 1;
                }
        else{
                return 0;
                }
        }
?>
===============================================================================

Active Directory doesn't accept anonymous requests anymore.

With Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users may initiate an LDAP request
against Windows Server 2003-based domain controllers. You can override this new
default behavior by changing the seventh character of the dsHeuristics
attribute on the DN path as follows:
CN=Directory Service,CN=Windows NT,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,Root domain in
forest

from: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326690

Example of connecting and searching AD

$con = ldap_connect('ad.domain.com');
ldap_set_option($con, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
ldap_set_option($con, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);
ldap_bind($con, 'user@DOMAIN.COM', 'clear password');

ldap_search($con, 'DC=domain,DC=com', '(uniqueMember=user)');
===============================================================================

had to do a bunch of research on this, but it does work, once config'd
correctly.

using Apache/2.2.3 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.3 OpenSSL/0.9.8b
PHP PHP Version 5.1.5-dev

ldap_bind was getting "81 Can't contact LDAP server" which was really annoying,
since the connection worked fine without "ldaps"
using:

$ldapconnect = @ldap_connect( $connection_string );

well, actually the bind was really the one failing...

$bind = ldap_bind($ldapconnect, $client, $this->objSecurityLogin->Password);

many attempts to determine until i smartened up and turned on the trace level:

ldap_set_option(NULL, LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL, 7);

which must go before the connect!

found that on windows, you can't specifiy a quote in the ldap.conf:
i had:
TLS_REQCERT never
TLS_CACERT "C:\\Documents\\Tools\\Apache2\\conf\\ssl\\ad.pem"
which throws the error..
TLS: could not load verify locations (file:`"C:\Documents\Tools\Apache2\conf\
ssl\ad.pem"',dir:`').
TLS: error:0200107B:system library:fopen:Unknown error .\crypto\bio\
bss_file.c:122
TLS: error:2006D002:BIO routines:BIO_new_file:system lib .\crypto\bio\
bss_file.c:127
TLS: error:0B084002:x509 certificate routines:X509_load_cert_crl_file:system
lib .\crypto\x509\by_file.c:274
ldap_err2string

changed to:
TLS_REQCERT never
TLS_CACERT C:\\Documents\\Tools\\Apache2\\conf\\ssl\\ad.pem
which cleans it up as:
TLS trace: SSL_connect:before/connect initialization
TLS trace: SSL_connect:SSLv2/v3 write client hello A
TLS trace: SSL_connect:SSLv3 read server hello A
TLS certificate verification: depth: 1, err: 0, subject: /DC=xxx/DC=yyy/CN=
zzzz, issuer: /DC=abab/DC=yyy/CN=zzzz
TLS certificate verification: depth: 0, err: 0, subject: ......

so the moral to the story is even though PHP wants quotes in some windows
config parms, it won't work if its in ldap.conf!
===============================================================================

I ran into an issue trying to bind as "cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com".  I took
the example kenn posted where he set LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION to "3" for the
connection.  Once I set this, I was able to bind with my manager id.
===============================================================================

It doesn't make much sense to let die() the script in case of an error,
otherwise to ask if there were no errors before proceeding the script, as the
official examples do.

better:

<?php
ldap_bind(...) or die(...);
do_something();
?>

or even better (die() is quick but dirty)

<?php
if (!ldap_bind(...)) {
  error();
} else {
  do_something();
}
?>
===============================================================================

This code sample shows how to connect and bind to eDirectory in PHP using LDAP
for Netware.

<?php

$server='137.65.138.159';
$admin='cn=admin,o=novell';
$passwd='novell';

$ds=ldap_connect($server);  // assuming the LDAP server is on this host

if ($ds) {
    // bind with appropriate dn to give update access
    $r=ldap_bind($ds, $admin, $passwd);
    if(!$r) die("ldap_bind failed<br>");

    echo "ldap_bind success";
    ldap_close($ds);
} else {
    echo "Unable to connect to LDAP server";
}
?>
===============================================================================

This may be a security issue but after tinkering for hours with the below ldap
auth function (edi01 at gmx dot at), I discovered that the ldap_bind function
will return true if you enter a valid username AND a NULL value!

so if that function were to receive something like $username = 'someuser' and
$password = '', it would return true. As long as it isn't a null value the
function will work as expected. Might as well check if it is null or empty
then.
===============================================================================

function checkldapuser($username,$password,$ldap_server){
  if($connect=@ldap_connect($ldap_server)){ // if connected to ldap server

    if (ldap_set_option($connect, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)) {
      echo "version 3<br>\n";
    } else {
      echo "version 2<br>\n";
    }
    echo "verification on '$ldap_server': ";

    // bind to ldap connection
    if(($bind=@ldap_bind($connect)) == false){

      return false;

Here a sample for using this function:

if (checkldapuser('myuser', 'secretpassword', 'ldap://link.to.ldap')) {
  echo "ACCESS GRANTED\n";
} else {
  echo "ACCESS DENIED\n";
}

I am assuming that ldap_bind does a simple bind and that for other
types of bind, ldap_sasl_bind should be used.

Also, while the allow bind v2 solution will work with slapd, you really should
use ldap v3 if at all possible because of the security improvements and
better protocol definition.  LDAP v2 is largely deprecated at this point.

Hopefully the PHP default LDAP version will move to v3 soon.
===============================================================================

As noted before with the password, I have found that if either  of the valuse
for user or password are blank, or as in my case a typo resulted in a blank
user as it was an undefined variable, the ldap_bind() will just perform an
anonymous bind and return true!
Shouldn't this detect the presence of the additional values and return an
error? At least if the user or password is passed. If they are both blank I'm
not sure what it should do.
===============================================================================

If you do not want to bind as unixadmin or *manager (i. e., for authentication
on web applications), the following code could be useful:
<?php

$ldaphost = "ldap.yourdomain.com";

/*for a SSL secured ldap_connect()

$ldaphost = "ldap.yourdomain.com"; */

$ldapport = 389;

$ds = ldap_connect($ldaphost, $ldapport)
or die("Could not connect to $ldaphost");

if ($ds) {

$username = "some_user";
$upasswd = "secret";
$binddn = "uid=$username,ou=people,dc=yourdomain,dc=com";

$ldapbind = ldap_bind($ds, $binddn, $upasswd);
                           
if ($ldapbind) {

print "Congratulations! $some_user is authenticated.";}

else {

print "Nice try, kid. Better luck next time!";}}

?>
===============================================================================

I want to point out that the line that reads

"$ldaprdn  = 'uname';" 

is a bit confusing. You need to ensure that you use the entire rootdn. for
instance. your code should look more like this...

<?php

// using ldap bind *** NOTE the uname *****
$ldaprdn  = 'cn=root,dc=testserver,dc=com';    // ldap rdn or dn
$ldappass = 'secret';  // associated password

// connect to ldap server
$ldapconn = ldap_connect("ldap.testserver.com")
   or die("Could not connect to LDAP server.");

if (ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)) {
   echo "Using LDAPv3";
} else {
   echo "Failed to set protocol version to 3";
}

if ($ldapconn) {

   // binding to ldap server
   $ldapbind = ldap_bind($ldapconn, $ldaprdn, $ldappass);

   // verify binding
   if ($ldapbind) {
       echo "LDAP bind successful...";
   } else {
       echo "LDAP bind failed...";
   }

}

?>
===============================================================================

OpenLdap 2.1.x libraries support both LDAPv2 and LDAPv3. The problem lies with
the slapd, the ldap server bundled with OpenLDAP.  It's default supported
version is LDAPv3. One can set the "allow bind_v2" in the slapd.conf file, with
this configured, the PHP ldap_set_option() is not required.
===============================================================================

I ran into a problem where I was getting a protocol error when I tried to
bind.  I was able to connect fine and ldap commands worked fine from the
command line. 

The problem turned out to be that openldap (v 2.1.5) was starting up in version
3 ldap mode, and php (4.2.3) expected it to be in version 2 mode.

To fix this use the ldap_set_option command to change the version that php
expects.
===============================================================================

One useful item when trying to bind to Novell's NDS LDAP servers.

If you are using NDS 8 and attempt to bind it will work with a partail context.

As an example if you full context is cn=user.ou=sales.ou=division.o=company
and you use as your authentication context cn=user.o=company it will work.

But you will be required to supply the full context to authenticate to an
eDirectory based LDAP setup. Such as Netware 6 or eDirectory 8.5 or greater.

Also when using the wildcard * symbol in your object class. If you are not
careful it is possible to dump the entire contents of your NDS tree into an
array.
===============================================================================

An example to help you authenticate against M$ Exchange, rather than use
anonymous mode...

you will need to create an NT domain member (I've called it ldapquery) and give
it search permission in the LDAP protocol settings in Exchange.

then:
$ds=ldap_connect ("<exchange server>"); 
$r=@ldap_bind($ds,"cn=ldapquery, o=<your organisation>, c=<your country>, ","
<the password for ldapquery account>");

we've tested this on Exchange 5.5SP3.
===============================================================================

The OpenLDAP libraries will return error 53 (Server unwilling to perform) when
trying to re-bind to a non-anonymous account if you accidentally leave the
password field blank. If you want to authenticate against a different field
than the dn, you have to bind to the server twice. Your code may look like the
following:

<?
function ldapLogin($uname, $pass, $base_dn, $fname, $server, $port){
    $ldc=@ldap_connect($server, $port);
    if (!$ldc) return ERROR_CODE;
   
    $bn='cn=anonymous-user,'.$base_dn;
    $pw='anonymous-pass';
    $lbind=@ldap_bind($ldc, $bn, $pw);
    if (!$lbind) return ERROR_CODE;
   
   
    $ureturn=@ldap_search($ldc, $base_dn, "($fname=$uname)", array('dn',
'givenName', 'sn', 'mail'));
   
   
    $uent=@ldap_first_entry($ldc, $ureturn);
    if (!$uent) return ERROR_CODE;
   
    $bn=@ldap_get_dn($ldc, $uent);
   
    //This line should use $pass rather than $password
    $lbind=@ldap_bind($ldc, $bn, $password);
    // Now you can find the error
    echo ldap_error($ltc);

    if ($lbind) return true; else return false;
?>

Hope this helps someone else running in to the same error.

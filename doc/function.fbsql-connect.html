(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fbsql_connect — Open a connection to a FrontBase Server

说明

resource fbsql_connect ([ string $hostname = ini_get("fbsql.default_host") [, 
string $username = ini_get("fbsql.default_user") [, string $password = ini_get
("fbsql.default_password") ]]] )

fbsql_connect() establishes a connection to a FrontBase server.

If a second call is made to fbsql_connect() with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling fbsql_close().

参数

hostname

    The server host name.

username

    The user name for the connection.

password

    The password for the connection.

返回值

Returns a positive FrontBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on errors.

范例

Example #1 fbsql_connect() example

<?php

$link = fbsql_connect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
    or die("Could not connect");
echo "Connected successfully";
fbsql_close($link);

?>

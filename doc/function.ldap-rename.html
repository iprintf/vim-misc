ldap_rename — Modify the name of an entry

说明

bool ldap_rename ( resource $link_identifier , string $dn , string $newrdn , 
string $newparent , bool $deleteoldrdn )

The entry specified by dn is renamed/moved.

参数

link_identifier

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

dn

    The distinguished name of an LDAP entity.

newrdn

    The new RDN.

newparent

    The new parent/superior entry.

deleteoldrdn

    If TRUE the old RDN value(s) is removed, else the old RDN value(s) is
    retained as non-distinguished values of the entry.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

注释

    Note:

    This function currently only works with LDAPv3. You may have to use 
    ldap_set_option() prior to binding to use LDAPv3. This function is only
    available when using OpenLDAP 2.x.x OR Netscape Directory SDK x.x.

Here's some clarification about the parameters when renaming a container in
Novell eDirectory:
- $new_rdn is in format "ou=new container name"
- newparent parameter is NULL - because we're renaming and not moving
- deleteoldrdn parameter if TRUE then old value of OU attribute is stored as a
secondary/further value of LDAP OU attribute. Novell ConsoleOne shows it as
'Other Name' attribute.

$full_old_dn= "ou=Cuckoo,ou=London,ou=UK,ou=Europe,o=Happy";
$new_rdn= "ou=Cuckoo Group";
   
ldap_rename( $conn, $full_old_dn, $new_rdn, NULL, TRUE);
===============================================================================

Since this function isn't documented to well I thought I'd help out those
trying to get this to work.

<?php
// $dn is the full DN of the entry you wish to move
$dn = 'cn=user1,ou=group1,dc=mydomain';
/*
    note that $newRdn IS NOT a full DN, it is only the start
    I've NOT gotten it to change attributes for the RDN
    but that could just be my schema
*/
$newRdn = 'cn=user2';
// $newparent IS the full DN to the NEW parent DN that you want to move/rename
to
$newParent = 'ou=group2,dc=mydomain';
ldap_rename($link, $dn, $newRdn, $newParent, true);
?>

Like I said above I haven't been able to get it to rename to a DIFFERENT
attribute so deleteoldrdn has no affect on it.
===============================================================================

If you are using Sun Directory Server 5.2, please note that you can't use
ldap_rename to move an entry. According to Sun's own documentation: "[...] At
this point in time, Directory Server does not support the ability to use the
modify DN operation to move an entry from one location in the directory tree to
another location." (http://docs.sun.com/source/817-6707/resultcodes.html)
The problem is that php does not return any error and the operation seems to
complete succesfully, except for the fact that nothing really happens. If you
check the server logs, there will be an "error 53" entry (server is unwilling
to perform).
hope this saves someone's couple of hours nasty searching...
===============================================================================

Though clearly mentioned, the following had me in spin for a good 10 minutes.

Ensure:

if (!ldap_set_option($conn, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3)) {
   // do something horrible
}

has been set _before_ you actually bind :)

Contrary to Richard Esplin's statement, this *is* the correct function to use
for renaming subtrees and moving entries from one place in the tree to another.
Just that most LDAP server implementations don't support moving non-leaf
entries.

E.g. In OpenLDAP, moving a non-leaf entry is only supported when using the
back-hdb database backend. SunOne only has one database backend, and it
apparently doesn't handle this type of operation.
===============================================================================

ldap_rename can only move leaf nodes of the directory tree. If your ldap entry
has any child entries, then ldap_rename is not the tool that you need. We
needed to change usernames, but that alters the dn. ldap_rename wouldn't work
because each of our user ldap entries has a couple associated child entries. We
had to write a function to recursively copy the subtree to the new location,
and then delete the original version. Here is the basic algorithm:

function recursive_move($old_username, $new_username)
    ldap_search on the old username to get the correct entry
    ldap_get_attributes to get an array of values from the ldap entry
    foreach attribute in array, replace occurences of $old_username with
$new_username
    ldap_add the attribute array into the new location
    ldap_modify any additional attributes
    ldap_list each child entry
    call function recursive_move on each child
    ldap_delete current entry
    return
===============================================================================

To get this function working make sure that the value for $newrdn is relative.
===============================================================================

A thing to remember when using ldap_rename or any other method that is not
doing just renaming but creating a new parent and moving children is that
you'll loose your original entryUUID!
We wanted to do a local DB mapping for LDAP->DB user groups thinking that it
would be the most stable resource identifier only to find out we were
absolutely wrong.
===============================================================================

Works also with eDirectory 8 (NW6).

If you are moving a user, remember that you also change the uid!

===============================================================================

if you are repeating an statement in an loop using bind_param and so on inside
it for a larger operation. i thougt id would be good to clean it with stmt->
close. but it broke always with an error after aprox. 250 operations . As i
tried it with  stmt->reset it worked for me.

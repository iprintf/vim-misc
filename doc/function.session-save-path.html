session_save_path

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_save_path — 读取/设置当前会话的保存路径

说明

string session_save_path ([ string $path ] )

session_save_path() 返回当前会话的保存路径。

参数

path

    指定会话数据保存的路径。必须在调用 session_start() 函数之前调用 
    session_save_path() 函数。

        Note:

        在某些操作系统上，建议使用可以高效处理大量小尺寸文件的文件系统上的路径
        来保存会话数据。例如，在 Linux 平台上，对于会话数据保存的工作而言，
        reiserfs 文件系统会比 ext2fs 文件系统能够提供更好的性能。

返回值

返回保存会话数据的路径。

I made a folder next to the public html folder and placed these lines at the
very first point in index.php

Location of session folder:

/domains/account/session

location of index.php

/domains/account/public_html/index.php

What I placed in index.php at line 0:

<?php
ini_set('session.save_path',realpath(dirname($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']) . '/../
session'));
session_start();

This is the only solution that worked for me. Hope this helps someone.

Debian does not use the default garbage collector for sessions. Instead, it
sets session.gc_probability to zero and it runs a cron job to clean up old
session data in the default directory.

As a result, if your site sets a custom location with session_save_path() you
also need to set a value for session.gc_probability, e.g.:

<?php
session_save_path('/home/example.com/sessions');
ini_set('session.gc_probability', 1);
?>

Otherwise, old files in '/home/example.com/sessions' will never get removed!

Session on clustered web servers !

We had problem in PHP session handling with 2 web server cluster. Problem was
one servers session data was not available in other server.

So I made a simple configuration in both server php.ini file. Changed
session.save_path default value to shared folder on both servers (/mnt/session
/).

It works for me. :)
===============================================================================

To Change the session path to a sub folder of your projects

ini_set('session.save_path',getcwd(). '/tmp');

saves the session in "tmp" folder.

After a lot of searches, tests and pain, the only one that worked for me was
this:

session_save_path(realpath(dirname($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']) . '/../
session'));

Under PHP for Windows, you can improve the speed, when you store all
session-files on ramdisk. A freeware-ramdisk you can download by http://
www.techsnack.net/gavotte-ramdisk-free-virtual-hardisk .

A other alternativ is store you session-datas to apc-user-cache (see
php-apc-extension).
===============================================================================

dont forget: if you use session_save_path on the page, that registers a
variable, you have also to use session_save_path on all the pages, where you
access the session-variable. under win32 you can use the double \\ to specify
eg "c:\\temp\\"

After a search for the cause of a issue causing users to have to login twice,
I've found a call to session_save_path() was the culprit.

What was happening was: the session save path was set, a session was opened,
some variables were set and the session was closed.  This was resulting in an
empty file in the specified session save path and of course no session data on
the next page load.  Oddly, on the second attempt the data was saved as
expected.

I found that removing the call to session_save_path() resolved the issue.  My
final solution was to replace the call to session_save_path($path) with an
equivalent call to ini_set('session.save_path', $path).
===============================================================================

This is an absolute must if you have an important login on a shared server.
Without it, other users of the server can do the following to bypass login:

* Visit login page, browse through cookies and grab the session id.
* Create a PHP script on their account that grabs and sets session variables
for a given session id.
* Read and change any values for that session id (for example passwords or
session keys), and therefore gain access to the protected area.

All users on web hosting should choose an dir below the HTTP directory struct,
but within their user area to store the session files.

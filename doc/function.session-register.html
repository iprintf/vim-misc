session_register

(PHP 4, PHP 5 < 5.4.0)

session_register — Register one or more global variables with the current
session

说明

bool session_register ( mixed $name [, mixed $... ] )

session_register() accepts a variable number of arguments, any of which can be
either a string holding the name of a variable or an array consisting of
variable names or other arrays. For each name, session_register() registers the
global variable with that name in the current session.

You can also create a session variable by simply setting the appropriate member
of the $_SESSION or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS (PHP < 4.1.0) array.
<?php
// Use of session_register() is deprecated
$barney = "A big purple dinosaur.";
session_register("barney");

// Use of $_SESSION is preferred, as of PHP 4.1.0
$_SESSION["zim"] = "An invader from another planet.";

// The old way was to use $HTTP_SESSION_VARS
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS["spongebob"] = "He's got square pants.";
?>

If session_start() was not called before this function is called, an implicit
call to session_start() with no parameters will be made. $_SESSION does not
mimic this behavior and requires session_start() before use.

注释

Caution

If you want your script to work regardless of register_globals, you need to
instead use the $_SESSION array as $_SESSION entries are automatically
registered. If your script uses session_register(), it will not work in
environments where the PHP directive register_globals is disabled.

    Note: register_globals 重要说明：

    自 PHP 4.2.0 起，PHP 指令 register_globals 的默认值为 off。PHP 社区鼓励开发
    者不要依赖于此指令, 用其他手段替代，例如superglobals。

Caution

This registers a global variable. If you want to register a session variable
from within a function, you need to make sure to make it global using the
global keyword or the $GLOBALS[] array, or use the special session arrays as
noted below.

Caution

If you are using $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use session_register
(), session_is_registered(), and session_unregister().

    Note:

    It is currently impossible to register resource variables in a session. For
    example, you cannot create a connection to a database and store the
    connection id as a session variable and expect the connection to still be
    valid the next time the session is restored. PHP functions that return a
    resource are identified by having a return type of resource in their
    function definition. A list of functions that return resources are
    available in the resource types appendix.

    If $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS for PHP 4.0.6 or less) is used, assign
    values to $_SESSION. For example: $_SESSION['var'] = 'ABC';

===============================================================================

if you remove session_register() calls and replace with $_SESSION assignments,
make sure that it wasn't being used in place of session_start(). If it was,
you'll need to add a call to session_start() too, before you assign to
$_SESSION.
===============================================================================

Below is a fix that may be included in older code to make it work with PHP6.
When needed it recreates the functions
- session_register()
- session_is_registered()
- session_unregister()

The functions inside the function fix_session_register() are only available 
after fix_session_register() has run.
Therefore in PHP<6 where there already is a session_register() nothing happens.

<?php
// Fix for removed Session functions
function fix_session_register(){
    function session_register(){
        $args = func_get_args();
        foreach ($args as $key){
            $_SESSION[$key]=$GLOBALS[$key];
        }
    }
    function session_is_registered($key){
        return isset($_SESSION[$key]);
    }
    function session_unregister($key){
        unset($_SESSION[$key]);
    }
}
if (!function_exists('session_register')) fix_session_register();
?>


[EDIT BY danbrown AT php DOT net: Bugfix provided by "dr3w" on 02-APR-2010:
"its [sic] function_exists with an S at the end".]
===============================================================================

If you have an old code with a lot of call to the function session_register(),
and you would like to make it compatible with PHP5 or PHP6, instead of
rewriting all your code by replacing this function by $_SESSION['var']="val";
you could use the function set_session_vars(), that is used exactly the same
way than session_register() (but there is no implicit call to session_start()
).

<?php
function set_session_vars() {
    $nb_args=func_num_args();
    $arg_list=func_get_args();
    for($i=0;$i<$nb_args;$i++) {
        global $$arg_list[$i];
        $_SESSION[$arg_list[$i]] = $$arg_list[$i];
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Something that hasn't really been touch on when migrating old code, is that
changes to variables made AFTER the session_register() call are still included
in the session state.
A lot of the implementations above only add the entry to $_SESSION[] at the
point it's called.
If the old code relies on this behaviour, you will either need to have code
called on exit to assign back to $_SESSION, or replace it in entirety with
$_SESSION usage. With over 1000 uses of the session_ functions, this is a bit
daunting!
===============================================================================

I've noticed that if you try to assign a value to a session variable with a
numeric name, the variable will not exist in future sessions.
For example, if you do something like:
session_start();
$_SESSION['14'] = "blah";
print_r($_SESSION);

It'll display:
Array ( [14] => "blah" )

But if on another page (with same session) you try
session_start();
print_r($_SESSION);

$_SESSION[14] will no longer exist.

Maybe everyone else already knows this, but I didn't realize it until messing
around with a broken script for quite a while.
===============================================================================

If you are using sessions and use session_register()  to register objects,
these objects are serialized automatically at the end of each PHP page, and are
unserialized automatically on each of the following pages. This basically means
that these objects can show up on any of your pages once they become part of
your session.
===============================================================================

You *MUST* notice that

session_register($var)

*IS NOT*

$_SESSION[$var] = $$var;

it is

if (!isset($_SESSION[$var]))
  $_SESSION[$var] = $$var;

when migrating from old style code.
===============================================================================

If you want to store an  object into the session, you have to check up that
object can be serialized at all.
For example, if your object contains aggregated PDO object (which can't be
serialized), you will get an error and no data would be stored.
===============================================================================

in addition to function set_session_vars instead of replacing all $var with
$_SESSION['var'],
you could get all set session-vars in prevoius scripts with this function

<?php
function get_session_vars() {
    $nb_args=func_num_args();
    $arg_list=func_get_args();
    for($i=0;$i<$nb_args;$i++) {
        global $$arg_list[$i] = $_SESSION[$arg_list[$i]];
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Please note that if you use a "|" sign in a variable name your entire session
will be cleared, so the example below will clear out all the contents of your
session.

<?php
session_start();
$_SESSION["foo|bar"] = "foo";
?>

It took me quite some time finding out why my session data kept disappearing.
According to this bugreport this behaviour is intended.
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33786
===============================================================================

If you have many websites with these functions in the source code (like me) you
can include the following functions in some kind of include.php that you have:

function session_register($session)
{
  //
}

function session_unregister($session)
{
  unset($_SESSION[$session]);
}

In this way the PHP interpreter detects the functions and do not return the
error, and the maintenance work is minimized.
===============================================================================

Make sure you put session_start() at the beggining of your script.

My sessions kept unsetting and I finally figured out why.

On my script, session_start() has to be said and uses cookies to set the
session.

But I was outputting html prior to calling session_start(), which prevented it
from succeeding becouse it uses the header function to place the cookies.

Once html has been outputed, session_start() can't use the header function to
set cookies, hence session_start() fails and no session can be started.
===============================================================================

For those of you who use this function (session_register that is), even though
the manual does specify that this function implicitly calls session_start(), I
just wanted to reiterate that fact. It is also important to know that if you
ever switch from session_register to using $_SESSION, make sure to call
session_start before adding items to the $_SESSION variable, because unlike
session_register, no implicit call to session_start is done.

Another reason I explain this is because I ran into a problem in which you can
add items to the $_SESSION variable all you want, but if session_start is not
called before adding them, they will not actually be saved to the session.
Using the same code, though, and replacing the $_SESSION assignments with
session_register without calling session_start WILL save that info to the
session.

It would be nice to have PHP check for writes to the $_SESSION variable and
complain with a warning if session_start hasn't been called.

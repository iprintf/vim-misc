IntlChar::charName — Retrieve the name of a Unicode character

说明

public static string IntlChar::charName ( mixed $codepoint [, int $nameChoice =
IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME ] )

Retrieves the name of a Unicode character.

Depending on nameChoice, the resulting character name is the "modern" name or
the name that was defined in Unicode version 1.0. The name contains only
"invariant" characters like A-Z, 0-9, space, and '-'. Unicode 1.0 names are
only retrieved if they are different from the modern names and if ICU contains
the data for them.

参数

codepoint

    The integer codepoint value (e.g. 0x2603 for U+2603 SNOWMAN), or the
    character encoded as a UTF-8 string (e.g. "\u{2603}")

nameChoice

    Which set of names to use for the lookup. Can be any of these constants:
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME (default)
      □ IntlChar::UNICODE_10_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::EXTENDED_CHAR_NAME
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_ALIAS
      □ IntlChar::CHAR_NAME_CHOICE_COUNT

返回值

The corresponding name, or an empty string if there is no name for this
character.

范例

Example #1 Testing different code points

<?php
var_dump(IntlChar::charName("."));
var_dump(IntlChar::charName(".", IntlChar::UNICODE_CHAR_NAME));
var_dump(IntlChar::charName("\u{2603}"));
var_dump(IntlChar::charName("\u{0000}"));
?>

以上例程会输出：

string(9) "FULL STOP"
string(9) "FULL STOP"
string(7) "SNOWMAN"
string(0) ""

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

odbc_tables — Get the list of table names stored in a specific data source

说明

resource odbc_tables ( resource $connection_id [, string $qualifier [, string
$owner [, string $name [, string $types ]]]] )

Lists all tables in the requested range.

To support enumeration of qualifiers, owners, and table types, the following
special semantics for the qualifier, owner, name, and table_type are available:

  • If qualifier is a single percent character (%) and owner and name are empty
    strings, then the result set contains a list of valid qualifiers for the
    data source. (All columns except the TABLE_QUALIFIER column contain NULLs.)
  • If owner is a single percent character (%) and qualifier and name are empty
    strings, then the result set contains a list of valid owners for the data
    source. (All columns except the TABLE_OWNER column contain NULLs.)
  • If table_type is a single percent character (%) and qualifier, owner and
    name are empty strings, then the result set contains a list of valid table
    types for the data source. (All columns except the TABLE_TYPE column
    contain NULLs.)

参数

connection_id

    ODBC 连接标识符，详见 odbc_connect()。

qualifier

    The qualifier.

owner

    The owner. Accepts search patterns ('%' to match zero or more characters
    and '_' to match a single character).

name

    The name. Accepts search patterns ('%' to match zero or more characters and
    '_' to match a single character).

types

    If table_type is not an empty string, it must contain a list of
    comma-separated values for the types of interest; each value may be
    enclosed in single quotes (') or unquoted. For example, "'TABLE','VIEW'" or
    "TABLE, VIEW". If the data source does not support a specified table type, 
    odbc_tables() does not return any results for that type.

返回值

Returns an ODBC result identifier containing the information 或者在失败时返回
FALSE.

The result set has the following columns:

  • TABLE_QUALIFIER
  • TABLE_OWNER
  • TABLE_NAME
  • TABLE_TYPE
  • REMARKS

The result set is ordered by TABLE_TYPE, TABLE_QUALIFIER, TABLE_OWNER and
TABLE_NAME.

Here a Code for listing Table names
<?php
$dbh = odbc_connect($dsn, $user, $pwd);

   $result = odbc_tables($dbh);

   $tables = array();
   while (odbc_fetch_row($result)){
     if(odbc_result($result,"TABLE_TYPE")=="TABLE")
       echo"<br>".odbc_result($result,"TABLE_NAME");

   }
?>
You don't have views or System tables with.
Only simple tables in your database.
===============================================================================

With regard to the note made on results not working.
Test the database with the easy:

odbc_result_all(odbc_tables($db));

$db is obviously a connected batadase. Then start to experiment:

if(!$odbcr=odbc_tables($db,"udb","", "%", "'TABLE'"))

"udb" is the DNS - aka 'name of my ODBC database in the Windows ODBC thingamy'.
In result_all the full path was shown but I just used the name I assigned;
either should work.

The second parameter "" is listed by result_all as "TABLE_SCHEM" and all items
were "NULL", so I have put "".

The third parameter is "%". According to result_all this col is "TABLE_NAME",
so I could have put the name of one of my tables, i.e. "Address".

In my case I have an Access database setup with several tables. In ODBC I have
created a link. Running the all on everything result above shows a set of
system tables which I do not need to know about at this point so I look at the
result and then build my new table check using the "TABLE" string as the tables
I am interested in are listed as "TABLE" under their "TABLE_TYPE" column.
===============================================================================

A bit of an extension on the previous posts:

I had a whale of a time trying to make this command work .. the parameters were
hard to decipher, and frequently my Apache module would just crash and burn
when I tried to run it. I FINALLY figured out what was wrong ...

< -- assuming $conn is your odbc_connect --->

$tablelist=odbc_tables($conn);
$tablelist=odbc_result_all($tablelist);

simply doesn't work. I don't understand the exact logistics of it, but the only
way I could get it to post the results was this:

$tablelist=odbc_result_all(odbc_tables($conn));

From there it was rather simple to add in parameters that fished out the
results I wanted.

To repeat again: I do not understand why the 2nd method works and the 1st one
does not. However, having struggled mightily with this function for almost 24
hours, posting this solution has proven to be greatly satisfying.
===============================================================================

Here's how to get a list of all the tables in your database.. with an actual
example of how its done and how to get the results.. and you don't need to put
in schema and all that other crap

<?php
$conn = odbc_connect("$database", "$username", "$password");
$tablelist = odbc_tables($conn);
while (odbc_fetch_row($tablelist)) {
if (odbc_result($tablelist, 4) == "TABLE")
echo odbc_result($tablelist, 3) ."<br>";
}
?>

to understand what the above is doing,
use odbc_result_all($tablelist); this will show you EVERYTHING returned by
odbc_tables() then you can look through it and see better how odbc_tables()
works and what exactly it returns in the string to get a better idea on how to
deal with it.
it would have saved me alot of time if i would have just taken a look at the
full string returned by odbc_tables(), so i suggest you take the minute or two
and look... here is an example of how to do it..which would have been helpful
for me ;x.

<?php
$conn = odbc_connect("$database", "$username", "$password");
$tablelist = odbc_tables($conn);
while (odbc_fetch_row($tablelist)) {
echo odbc_result_all($tablelist);
}
?>

hopefully this will help some people.. i have alot more to add about this but
no time :(
so again hope this helps.

use odbc_tables($con, "%") to get a list of all available catalogs (databases).

use odbc_tables($con, "", "%") to get a list of all schemas available.

use odbc_tables($con, "", "", "", "%") to get a list of all table types
available.

use odbc_tables($con, "my catalog", "my schema", "%", "'TABLE', 'VIEW'") to get
a list of all tables available.

using odbc_tables($con, "%", "%", "%", "%") will return an empty array !

Before PHP 4.0.3 uou could use this function with 1 or 5 prarms. From 4.0.3 the
function matches the documentation.
===============================================================================

This probably works for a variety of formats, but if you want a list of *just*
the table names from an SQL dsn source (I'm using MSSQL), here's the code.

<?php

# ... assign $dsn, $uid, & $pwd ...

$dbh = odbc_connect($dsn, $uid, $pwd);

    $result = odbc_tables($dbh);
   
    $tables = array();
    while (odbc_fetch_row($result))
        array_push($tables, odbc_result($result, "TABLE_NAME") );
   
    foreach( $tables as $t ) {
        echo "$t\n";   
    }

?>

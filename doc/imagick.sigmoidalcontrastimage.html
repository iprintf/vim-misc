Imagick::sigmoidalContrastImage — Adjusts the contrast of an image

说明

bool Imagick::sigmoidalContrastImage ( bool $sharpen , float $alpha , float
$beta [, int $channel = Imagick::CHANNEL_ALL ] )

Adjusts the contrast of an image with a non-linear sigmoidal contrast
algorithm. Increase the contrast of the image using a sigmoidal transfer
function without saturating highlights or shadows. Contrast indicates how much
to increase the contrast (0 is none; 3 is typical; 20 is pushing it); mid-point
indicates where midtones fall in the resultant image (0 is white; 50 is
middle-gray; 100 is black). Set sharpen to TRUE to increase the image contrast
otherwise the contrast is reduced.

Non-linearity Contrast

参数

sharpen

    If true increase the contrast, if false decrease the contrast.

alpha

    The amount of contrast to apply. 1 is very little, 5 is a significant
    amount, 20 is extreme.

beta

    Where the midpoint of the gradient will be. This value should be in the
    range 0 to 1 - mutliplied by the quantum value for ImageMagick.

channel

    Which color channels the contrast will be applied to.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE。

范例

Example #1 Create a gradient image using Imagick::sigmoidalContrastImage()
suitable for blending two images together smoothly, with the blending defined
by $contrast and $the midpoint

<?php

function generateBlendImage($width, $height, $contrast = 10, $midpoint = 0.5) {
    $imagick = new Imagick();
    $imagick->newPseudoImage($width, $height, 'gradient:black-white');
    $quanta = $imagick->getQuantumRange();
    $imagick->sigmoidalContrastImage(true, $contrast, $midpoint * $quanta[
"quantumRangeLong"]);

    return $imagick; 
}

?>

===============================================================================

The documentation for this function really isn't useful or helpful at all.
"Sharpen", "Contrast" and "Midpoint" aren't the names of the params, which are
referred to as "alpha" and "beta".

The Imagemagick manual entry:

For those interested, the corrected formula for the 'sigmoidal non-linearity
contrast control' is...
( 1/(1+exp(β*(α-u))) - 1/(1+exp(β)) ) / ( 1/(1+exp(β*(α-1))) - 1/(1+exp(β*α)) )
Where α is the threshold level, and β the contrast factor to be applied.
The formula is actually very simple exponential curve, with the bulk of the
above formula is designed to ensure that 0 remains zero and 1 remains one. That
is, the graph always goes though the points 0,0 and 1,1. And the highest
gradient of change is at the given threshold.

In the Imagick extension source, the function call is:

status = MagickSigmoidalContrastImageChannel(intern->magick_wand, channel,
sharpen, alpha, beta);

Src: https://github.com/mkoppanen/imagick/

Referring back to the binary API call gives:

foreign import ccall "MagickSigmoidalContrastImageChannel"
magickSigmoidalContrastImageChannel
  :: Ptr MagickWand
  -> ChannelType       -- ^ identify which channel to level: `redChannel`,
`greenChannel`
  -> MagickBooleanType -- ^ increase or decrease image contrast
  -> CDouble           -- ^ strength of the contrast, the larger the number the
more 'threshold-like' it becomes
  -> CDouble           -- ^ midpoint of the function as a color value 0 to
`quantumRange`
  -> IO MagickBooleanType

Graphics-ImageMagick-MagickWand-FFI-WandImage.html

So the parameters should apparently be interpreted:

Sharpen:     0/1 (increase/decrease contrast)
Alpha:       Strength of the contrast (typically 3-20)
Beta:        Midpoint of the contrast (typically 50)
===============================================================================

The formula for sigmoidal contrast given by Thyssen is missing a term. It
should be:

( 1/(1+exp(β*(α-u))) - 1/(1+exp(β*α)) ) / ( 1/(1+exp(β*(α-1))) - 1/(1+exp(β*α))
)

where there was an α missing from the second term.

Note that a sigmoidal contrast with α = 6 and β = 0.46 is approximately
equivalent to combining a "screen" overlay of the image on itself, followed by
a "multiply" overlay.

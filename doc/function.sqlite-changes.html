===============================================================================

When executing DELETEs, I found that adding an always true WHERE clause returns
the number of rows deleted.

eg:  "DELETE FROM my_table WHERE 1"  will delete all the rows and
sqlite_changes() will return the correct number of rows deleted.
===============================================================================

When counting deleted records from the database, I realized that sqlite_changes
() will return 0 if you are deleting all the records without including a WHERE
clause.

So after "DELETE FROM users" sqlite_open() will print 0 even if rows where
deleted, but if you use "DELETE FROM users WHERE 1" you will get the right
result.

I had this problem on versions 5.0.4 and 4.4.0 under Windows servers.

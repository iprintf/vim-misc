print

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

print — 输出字符串

说明

int print ( string $arg )

输出 arg。

print 实际上不是一个函数（它是一个语言结构），因此你可以不必使用圆括号来括起它
的参数列表。

参数

arg

    输入数据。

返回值

总是返回 1。

范例

Example #1 print 范例

<?php
print("Hello World");

print "print() also works without parentheses.";

print "This spans
multiple lines. The newlines will be
output as well";

print "This spans\nmultiple lines. The newlines will be\noutput as well.";

print "escaping characters is done \"Like this\".";

// 可以在打印语句中使用变量
$foo = "foobar";
$bar = "barbaz";

print "foo is $foo"; // foo is foobar

// 也可以使用数组
$bar = array("value" => "foo");

print "this is {$bar['value']} !"; // this is foo !

// 使用单引号将打印变量名，而不是变量的值
print 'foo is $foo'; // foo is $foo

// 如果没有使用任何其他字符，可以仅打印变量
print $foo;          // foobar

print <<<END
This uses the "here document" syntax to output
multiple lines with $variable interpolation. Note
that the here document terminator must appear on a
line with just a semicolon no extra whitespace!
END;
?>

注释

    Note: 因为是一个语言构造器而不是一个函数，不能被可变函数调用。

Be careful when using print. Since print is a language construct and not a
function, the parentheses around the argument is not required.
In fact, using parentheses can cause confusion with the syntax of a function
and SHOULD be omited.

Most would expect the following behavior:
<?php
    if (print("foo") && print("bar")) {
        // "foo" and "bar" had been printed
    }
?>

But since the parenthesis around the argument are not required, they are
interpretet as part of the argument.
This means that the argument of the first print is

    ("foo") && print("bar")

and the argument of the second print is just

    ("bar")

For the expected behavior of the first example, you need to write:
<?php
    if ((print "foo") && (print "bar")) {
        // "foo" and "bar" had been printed
    }
?>

I wrote a println function that determines whether a \n or a <br /> should be
appended to the line depending on whether it's being executed in a shell or a
browser window.  People have probably thought of this before but I thought I'd
post it anyway - it may help a couple of people.

<?php
function println ($string_message) {
    $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] ? print "$string_message<br />" : print "
$string_message\n";
}
?>

Examples:

Running in a browser:

<?php println ("Hello, world!"); ?>
Output: Hello, world!<br />

Running in a shell:

<?php println ("Hello, world!"); ?>
Output: Hello, world!\n
===============================================================================

I have written a script to benchmark the several methods of outputting data in
PHP: via single quotes, double quotes, heredoc, and printf. The script
constructs a paragraph of text with each method. It performs this construction
10,000 times, then records how long it took. In total, it prints 160,000 times
and records 16 timings. Here are the raw results.

Outputted straight to browser--

Single quotes: 2,813 ms
...with concatenation: 1,179 ms
Double quotes: 5,180 ms
...with concatenation: 3,937 ms
heredoc: 7,300 ms
...with concatenation: 6,288 ms
printf: 9,527 ms
...with concatenation: 8,564 ms

Outputted to the output buffer--

Single quotes: 8 ms
...with concatenation: 38 ms
Double quotes: 8 ms
...with concatenation: 47 ms
heredoc: 17 ms
...with concatenation: 49 ms
printf: 54 ms
...with concatenation: 52 ms

A nice graph of the script's output can be found here:
http://i3x171um.com/output_benchmarks/ob.gif

So what should you choose to print your text? I found several things out
writing this.

First, it should be noted that the print and echo keywords are interchangeable,
performance-wise. The timings show that one is probably an alias for the other.
So use whichever you feel most comfortable with.

Second, if you've ever wondered which was better, the definitive answer is
single quotes. Single quotes are at least four times faster in any situation.
Double quotes, while more convenient, do pose a debatably significant
performance issue when outputting massive amounts of data.

Third, stay away from heredoc, and absolutely stay away from [s]printf. They're
slow, and the alternatives are there.

The source of my script can be found here:
http://i3x171um.com/output_benchmarks/ob.txt

DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT ON THE INTERNET! Run it instead from localhost. The
script outputs ~45 megabytes of text in an html comment at the top of the page
by default. Expect the benchmark to take ~45 seconds. If this is too long, you
can change the amount of iterations to a lower number (the results scale
accurately down to about 1,000 iterations).
===============================================================================

I have a small utility run from the command line that processes a potentially
huge list of files. As it can take hours to complete, I stuck a 

print '.';

statement in the body of the main loop to prove that something was  happening.

For reasons unknown to me, the utiliity suddenly started buffering the output
such that it printed nothing until completion, defeating the purpose of the
running monitor. Adding flush() statements did nothing. The problem was solved
by using

fputs(STDOUT, '.');

but I have no idea why.

"print is not actually a real function (it is a language construct) so you are
not required to use parentheses with its argument list."

I don't think it has an "argument list" because the following gives a syntax
error:

print (1, 2);

Here is an example of how the brackets work with print:

print ((1) + (2)) + (3);

Unlike a function it doesn't just use the first brackets... it prints "9".

mvpetrovich of 2007 could just use single quotes as his string delimiters (see
the example in the current documentation).
It's not ALWAYS appropriate, but generally it is best (the Zend Framework
coding standards have a good take on this). It yields a number of interesting
benefits:
1: Nobody will be tempted to write functions to replace backticks or other
characters with double quotes. Such functions may cause a (negligible) loss of
efficiency, and maybe other undesired effects.
2: You will be able to use double quotes without escaping. This is recommended
(although not required) for HTML and XML attributes, as well as quoted text.
3: The script will hit the browser very slightly slightly faster since PHP
doesn't have to scan through the string looking for variables, escaped
characters, curly braces or other things.
4: Your code gets ten times easier to read. (as mvpetrovich pointed out)

If, in spite of these four excellent benefits, you really MUST still use double
quotes to delimit boring old string constants (and seriously, why would you?),
you could use the slightly less favourable single quotes as delimiters for most
markup languages.
HTML served as HTML will even let you lay out unquoted attributes (yuck).

It should also be noted though that if you are just printing bare strings, you
may as well shut off the php parser. The quickest way to send a string is to
write it as plain text, OUTSIDE of the php tags. This will also make your code
look excellent in a lot of syntax highlighters.

There are few disadvantages to doing this, if any. Output buffering still
works. All your classes and objects and includes remain in place. Your script
runs faster. World peace is obtained.

        // "foo" and "bar" have been printed
    }

===============================================================================

An update to the println function I wrote below, this is a more efficient,
correct and returns a value (1, always; (print)).

<?php

    function println($string_message = '') {
        return isset($_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL']) ? print "$string_message<br
/>" . PHP_EOL:
          print $string_message . PHP_EOL;
    }

?>
===============================================================================

This is a simple function for printing debug comments that I didn't think of
for a long time. Maybe it'll serve you good too.

<?php

function printd($str) {
  if ($debug) { echo $str; }
}

// ...

if ($valueCalculatedEarlierInTheScript == 3) {
  doSomethingWithNoOutput();
  printd("doSomethingWithNoOutput() has executed.");
}

?>

It's mostly just to make sure everything is running without having to go
through everything and put in echo "Step #whatever has executed" whenever
something mysterious isn't working.
===============================================================================

Note that if you want to dump the value of a variable, you want to use print_r
(), var_dump() or var_export().

I grew quite tired of backslashes, and wrote these routines. It uses the back
single quote as a substitute for double quotes within a statement.  It made my
code much more readable.  It is a little easier than using a "here document." 
I also found I make a few less typing errors.

<?php

function qq($text) {return str_replace('`','"',$text); }
function printq($text) { print qq($text); }
function printqn($text) { print qq($text)."\n"; }

//example - before

echo "<a href=\"#\" class=\"stdbutton\" style=\"float:left;\" onclick=\
"myfunction(); return false;\">My Link</a>\n";

//becomes - with printqn function

printqn("<a href=`#` class=`stdbutton` style=`float:left;` onclick=`myfunction
(); return false;`>My Link</a>");

?>
===============================================================================

HERE Documents can reference arrays as long as you enclose
the vars in {}.

Like this:

<?php

$line = array( 'title' => "Hello", 'date' => 'Today');

echo <<<EOT
Title: {$line['title']}
Date: {$line['date']}
EOT;

?>

Run this and get
Title: Hello
Date: Today

===============================================================================

Check this statement:

echo 3 . print(2) . print(4) . 5 . 'c' . print(6) . print(7). 'b' .print(8) .
'a';

It's will always output starting from the right to the left.

Thus we have:

8a                              //1o print
7b18a                        //2o print
617b18a                    //3o print
8a7b16145c1             //4o print

8a7b16145c12131     //Final output

That's it.

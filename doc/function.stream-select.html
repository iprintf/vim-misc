stream_select

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

stream_select — Runs the equivalent of the select() system call on the given
arrays of streams with a timeout specified by tv_sec and tv_usec

说明

int stream_select ( array &$read , array &$write , array &$except , int $tv_sec
[, int $tv_usec = 0 ] )

The stream_select() function accepts arrays of streams and waits for them to
change status. Its operation is equivalent to that of the socket_select()
function except in that it acts on streams.

参数

read

    The streams listed in the read array will be watched to see if characters
    become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read will not
    block - in particular, a stream resource is also ready on end-of-file, in
    which case an fread() will return a zero length string).

write

    The streams listed in the write array will be watched to see if a write
    will not block.

except

    The streams listed in the except array will be watched for high priority
    exceptional ("out-of-band") data arriving.

        Note:

        When stream_select() returns, the arrays read, write and except are
        modified to indicate which stream resource(s) actually changed status.

    You do not need to pass every array to stream_select(). You can leave it
    out and use an empty array or NULL instead. Also do not forget that those
    arrays are passed by reference and will be modified after stream_select()
    returns.
tv_sec

    The tv_sec and tv_usec together form the timeout parameter, tv_sec
    specifies the number of seconds while tv_usec the number of microseconds.
    The timeout is an upper bound on the amount of time that stream_select()
    will wait before it returns. If tv_sec and tv_usec are both set to 0, 
    stream_select() will not wait for data - instead it will return
    immediately, indicating the current status of the streams.

    If tv_sec is NULL stream_select() can block indefinitely, returning only
    when an event on one of the watched streams occurs (or if a signal
    interrupts the system call).

    Warning

    Using a timeout value of 0 allows you to instantaneously poll the status of
    the streams, however, it is NOT a good idea to use a 0 timeout value in a
    loop as it will cause your script to consume too much CPU time.

    It is much better to specify a timeout value of a few seconds, although if
    you need to be checking and running other code concurrently, using a
    timeout value of at least 200000 microseconds will help reduce the CPU
    usage of your script.

    Remember that the timeout value is the maximum time that will elapse; 
    stream_select() will return as soon as the requested streams are ready for
    use.

tv_usec

    See tv_sec description.

返回值

On success stream_select() returns the number of stream resources contained in
the modified arrays, which may be zero if the timeout expires before anything
interesting happens. On error FALSE is returned and a warning raised (this can
happen if the system call is interrupted by an incoming signal).

范例

Example #1 stream_select() Example

This example checks to see if data has arrived for reading on either $stream1
or $stream2. Since the timeout value is 0 it will return immediately:

<?php
/* Prepare the read array */
$read   = array($stream1, $stream2);
$write  = NULL;
$except = NULL;
if (false === ($num_changed_streams = stream_select($read, $write, $except, 0
))) {
    /* Error handling */
} elseif ($num_changed_streams > 0) {
    /* At least on one of the streams something interesting happened */
}
?>

注释

    Note:

    Due to a limitation in the current Zend Engine it is not possible to pass a
    constant modifier like NULL directly as a parameter to a function which
    expects this parameter to be passed by reference. Instead use a temporary
    variable or an expression with the leftmost member being a temporary
    variable:
    <?php
    $e = NULL;
    stream_select($r, $w, $e, 0);
    ?>

    Note:

    Be sure to use the === operator when checking for an error. Since the 
    stream_select() may return 0 the comparison with == would evaluate to TRUE:
    <?php
    $e = NULL;
    if (false === stream_select($r, $w, $e, 0)) {
        echo "stream_select() failed\n";
    }
    ?>

    Note:

    If you read/write to a stream returned in the arrays be aware that they do
    not necessarily read/write the full amount of data you have requested. Be
    prepared to even only be able to read/write a single byte.

    Note:

    Some streams (like zlib) cannot be selected by this function.

    Note:

    Windows compatibility: stream_select() used on a pipe returned from 
    proc_open() may cause data loss under Windows 98.

    Use of stream_select() on file descriptors returned by proc_open() will
    fail and return FALSE under Windows.

A handy syntactic trick:

<?php
$r = Array($stream1, $stream2);
stream_select($r, $w = null, $x = null, 1337);
?>

I've seen it recommended elsewhere in the documentation for clarifying magic
arguments so maintainers don't have to go check the function itself, but it
also solves your problem here.
===============================================================================

Note that you should change the calctimeout function below to divide the
outcome by 1.000.000 otherwise you'll be waiting for two years instead of one
minute for the socket to timeout...

<?php

// The function to calculate the timeout
function calctimeout($maxtime, $starttime)
{
   return ($maxtime - ((microtime(true) - $starttime) * 1000000))/1000000;
}

?>
===============================================================================

If you try to use stream_select() with fread(), you may get bit by a
combination of bugs (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52602 and https://
bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=51056). As of PHP 5.5.10, fread() and stream_select()
don't reliably play well together.

If you need stream_select() and you don't need an encrypted connection (e.g.
TLS), use stream_socket_recvfrom() instead of fread().

I can't find a way to reliably handle an encrypted connection with blocking
functions in PHP; non-blocking might be the only way to do it.
===============================================================================

Please note that, on return, the key of "read" will be zero based, serially
numbered according to the streams for which there is read data ready only. In
other words, if you want to know which of the original streams placed in "read"
is ready, there is no immediate way of knowing that.

If you want to know which of the original stream is which, you can either use "
==", or possibly set a reverse map array, in which the stream is the key, and
the key to the original "read" array is the data.
===============================================================================

If you want to set an absolute maximum execution time for stream_select in a
loop, it's important to decrement the max_time value passed to stream_select.

<?php
// The maximum time for execution in milliseconds
$maxtime = 200000;
// The time the loop started
$starttime = microtime(true);
// Original array of sockets
$r = $orig_sockets;

// The function to calculate the timeout
function calctimeout($maxtime, $starttime)
{
    return $maxtime - ((microtime(true) - $starttime) * 1000000);
}

while (stream_select($r, $w = null, $e = null, 0, calctimeout($maxtime, 
$starttime)) !== 0)
{
    // loop through the sockets that showed activity
    foreach ($r as $socket) {
        // $socket talked
    }

    // stream_select modifies the contents of $r
    // in a loop we should replace it with the original
    $r = $orig_sockets;
}

?>
===============================================================================

Note: At least one of the input arrays must be non-empty, or you get an
E_WARNING message:
PHP Warning:  stream_select(): unable to select [9]: Bad file descriptor
(max_fd=0) in
===============================================================================

You can key on file descriptors just fine by casting them to an int or a
string, which returns what you would expect.
===============================================================================

If you use stream_select() with a blocking stream, you are doing it wrong!

Just because this function returns something in one or more of the arrays does
NOT mean that a future read or write operation will not block.

The above sentence is the most important sentence you will ever read regarding
stream manipulation.  Using stream_select() with blocking streams is a very
common amateur mistake and causes major headaches when tracking down usage of
this and similar select() system functions.  PHP (and really the underlying OS)
should verify that the supplied stream set is not blocking and throw an error/
exception if any socket is set to block so that people are forced to fix their
code.  The documentation for stream_select() is, at best, misleading.

If you want a non-blocking stream, then set the stream to not block. 
Otherwise, live with the blocking stream.  That is, after all, the whole point
of blocking - to block indefinitely until the operation completes.  select() is
built for non-blocking streams ONLY.  Any other use will result in very hard to
track down bugs.

I got the above lecture many years ago after encountering the very bugs I
mention.  I fixed my code and now correct similar mistakes when I run into the
issue elsewhere.  Writing code for non-blocking streams is simpler than trying
to write hacks for blocking streams with select() functions and ending up with
application bugs.
===============================================================================

Note that contrary to what the previous poster said, one is not able to use a
stream resource as a key for an array. Rather, if you want to know which socket
you are dealing with, consider using code similar to this:

<?php
$sockets = array("sock_1" => $sock1, "sock_2" => $sock2, "sock_3" => $sock_3);

$read = $write = $error = $sockets;
$num = stream_select($read, $write, $error, 10);
if ($n > 0) {
    foreach ($read as $r) {
        $key = array_search($r, $sockets);
        // $key will be "sock_1", "sock_2", "sock_3", etc.
    }
}
?>

Hope that helps someone out there!
===============================================================================

If you're getting unexplainable problems with nonblocking sockets using
stream_select, disable the buffers using:

stream_set_read_buffer($socket, 0);
stream_set_write_buffer($socket, 0);

For some reason when writing (in total) ~256k, sockets start returning FALSE
when reading, yet always appear in the stream_select arrays. This fixed that
problem. (for us.)
===============================================================================

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42682

This function will not return the number of changed streams under certain
systems with older versions, but instead it will return '0'. Be careful.
===============================================================================

Note that reading from a regular file which is on end-of-file will *not* block.
You'll get a non-blocking, zero-byte read.  However, stream_select *will* block
if the input is a pipe, and there is no more data to be had.
===============================================================================

Simple stream_select wrapper.. Returns the first stream in the array, and sets
parameter 2 to the key (So that it is easy to identify what received data):

<?php
function select($array, &$vkey, $timeout=0){
    $select = array();
    $null = NULL;
    foreach($array as $key => $sock){
        $x = count($select);
        $select[$x] = $sock;
        $keys[$x] = $key;
    }
    if(stream_select($select, $null, $null, $timeout)){
        foreach($keys as $key){
            if($array[$key] == $select[0]){
                $vkey = $key;
                return($select[0]);
            }
        }
    }
}

$streams = array("foo" => $stream_one, "bar" => $stream_two); // Create an
array of two (already existant) streams.
if($new = select($streams, $key, 60)){ //Sets $new to the resource that next
gets new data, and $key to either "foo", or "bar", depending which one it is.
    echo $key.":".stream_get_line($new, 2048)."\n";
}
?>
===============================================================================

Make sure not to pass the same variable in the 3 arguments to stream_select, or
you'll only get the results from one of them and the others will be
overwritten.
===============================================================================

stream_select() looks deceptively like a simple wrapper around POSIX select(2).

But beware: while select(2) allows you to pass no file descriptors and use it
as a "portable subsecond sleep", PHP will complain with "Warning: stream_select
(): No stream arrays were passed in ****" if all arrays are empty or null, and
it WONT sleep, it will return immediately. So... if the number of file
descriptors you have isn't static, you have to deal with the special case
yourself.

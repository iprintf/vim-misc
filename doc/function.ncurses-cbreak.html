ncurses_cbreak — Switch off input buffering

说明

bool ncurses_cbreak ( void )
Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Disables line buffering and character processing (interrupt and flow control
characters are unaffected), making characters typed by the user immediately
available to the program.

返回值

Returns TRUE or NCURSES_ERR if any error occurred.

===============================================================================

re satoru's post,
While it's not using cbreak, it sorta is an example. The only difference
between raw and cbreak is how control keys are delt with.

Quoted from the ncurses_programming_howto:
Normally the terminal driver buffers the characters a user types until a new
line or carriage return is encountered. But most programs require that the
characters be available as soon as the user types them. The above two functions
are used to disable line buffering. The difference between these two functions
is in the way control characters like suspend (CTRL-Z), interrupt and quit
(CTRL-C) are passed to the program. In the raw() mode these characters are
directly passed to the program without generating a signal. In the cbreak()
mode these control characters are interpreted as any other character by the
terminal driver.

  [HOW TO EXIT]
  Push space key to terminate raw mode.

  [TESTING]
  Tested with FreeBSD5.3R + PHP5.0.5-CLI.
  The option '--with-ncurses' required.

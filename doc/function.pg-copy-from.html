pg_copy_from

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pg_copy_from — 根据数组将记录插入表中

说明

bool pg_copy_from ( resource $connection , string $table_name , array $rows [, 
string $delimiter [, string $null_as ]] )

pg_copy_from() 将数组 rows 的内容作为记录插入表中。它在内部使用了 COPY FROM SQL
命令来插入记录。

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource.

table_name

    Name of the table into which to copy the rows.

rows

    An array of data to be copied into table_name. Each value in rows becomes a
    row in table_name. Each value in rows should be a delimited string of the
    values to insert into each field. Values should be linefeed terminated.

delimiter

    The token that separates values for each field in each element of rows.
    Default is TAB.

null_as

    How SQL NULL values are represented in the rows. Default is \N ("\N").

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 pg_copy_from() example

<?php
   $db = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
   
   $rows = pg_copy_to($db, $table_name);
   
   pg_query($db, "DELETE FROM $table_name");
   
   pg_copy_from($db, $table_name, $rows);
?>

===============================================================================

Default is "\\\N" not "\\N" at least in php 5.4

pg_copy_from($db, $table_name, "\t", "\\\N")
===============================================================================

see also: pg_put_line for a solution that does not require buffering of all the
data to be copied,
===============================================================================

pg syntax is :
COPY test (cola, colb, colc) FROM stdin;
...

this function doesn't let you in which order the columns are !
===============================================================================

By default NULL values are a backslash followed with capital N ("\\N").

Also, you can't insert entries with OIDs (I've added it to my TODO list though)
===============================================================================

Something needs to be said about the format of the array.
Judging by what I've seen, it's pretty much what you get
from loading a tab-separated file with file(). That is, the
lines are linefeed-terminated and there's no need to have
an extra line with "\.". On the other hand, when I try using this
command the connection to the server ends up in some odd
state and is then lost:
PHP Warning:  U S o() query failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly

I think it might be safer to use the lower-level function
pg_put_line() for now.
===============================================================================

As of postgresql 9.1 "standard_conforming_strings" is set to on

This will not work anymore
<?php
$copy_message = "1\t\\N\t300";
pg_copy_from($db, "message", $copy_message);
?>
result will be a "N" in that field. if the field allow text that is else it
will fail to insert the post.

simple fix
<?php
$copy_message = "1\t\\NULL\t300";
pg_copy_from($db, "message", $copy_message, "\t","\\NULL");
?>
===============================================================================

Fix for "Copy command failed: ERROR: literal carriage return
found in data" or
"Copy command failed: ERROR: missing data for column
"message" CONTEXT: COPY message, line 1:"

<?php
$message = "HEJ\rHEJ\nHEJ\r\nHEJ\n\rHEJ\tHELLO\\";

$message = addslashes($message);

$message = str_replace(
  array("\n","\r","\t"),
  array("\\n","\\r","\\t"),
  $message);

$copy_message = "1\t". $message ."\t300";

pg_copy_from($db, "message", $copy_message);
?>

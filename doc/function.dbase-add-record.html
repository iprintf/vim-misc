===============================================================================

Field type incompatible inputs can cause PHP to crash or strange errors to
occur. After finding that out it was easy to fill also "big" dbase-files with
size bigger than 15 MB. Don't let your enthusiasm be broken by inexact error
messages! :-)
===============================================================================

I had some problems with old dbase3 database. Odd behaviour of the php-progs
and incomplete file copies.

I assume that the header was partly corrupt, but clipper-progs worked fine. I
copied structure to file (copy to test structure extended), then rebuilt the 
database from the structure file again and made an append from the original
file.
That fixed the error.

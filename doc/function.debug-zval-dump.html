Dumps a string representation of an internal zend value to output.

参数

variable

    The variable being evaluated.

返回值

没有返回值。

范例

Example #1 debug_zval_dump() example

<?php
$var1 = 'Hello World';
$var2 = '';

$var2 =& $var1;

debug_zval_dump(&$var1);
?>

以上例程会输出：

&string(11) "Hello World" refcount(3)

    Note: Beware the refcount

    The refcount value returned by this function is non-obvious in certain
    circumstances. For example, a developer might expect the above example to
    indicate a refcount of 2. The third reference is created when actually
    calling debug_zval_dump().

    This behavior is further compounded when a variable is not passed to 
    debug_zval_dump() by reference. To illustrate, consider a slightly modified
    version of the above example:

    <?php
    $var1 = 'Hello World';
    $var2 = '';

    $var2 =& $var1;

    debug_zval_dump($var1); // not passed by reference, this time
    ?>

    以上例程会输出：

    string(11) "Hello World" refcount(1)

    Why refcount(1)? Because a copy of $var1 is being made, when the function
    is called.

    This function becomes even more confusing when a variable with a refcount
    of 1 is passed (by copy/value):

    <?php
    $var1 = 'Hello World';

    debug_zval_dump($var1);
    ?>

    以上例程会输出：

    string(11) "Hello World" refcount(2)

    A refcount of 2, here, is extremely non-obvious. Especially considering the
    above examples. So what's happening?

    When a variable has a single reference (as did $var1 before it was used as
    an argument to debug_zval_dump()), PHP's engine optimizes the manner in
    which it is passed to a function. Internally, PHP treats $var1 like a
    reference (in that the refcount is increased for the scope of this
    function), with the caveat that if the passed reference happens to be
    written to, a copy is made, but only at the moment of writing. This is
    known as "copy on write."

    So, if debug_zval_dump() happened to write to its sole parameter (and it
    doesn't), then a copy would be made. Until then, the parameter remains a
    reference, causing the refcount to be incremented to 2 for the scope of the
    function call.

===============================================================================

The add of "Call-time pass-by-reference" as E_DEPRECATED makes it impossible to
get the real refcount without getting an error, since <?php error_reporting(
E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED); ?> and even <?php @debug_zval_dump(&$foo); ?> doesn't
change anything.
===============================================================================

"Fatal error: Call-time pass-by-reference has been removed ..." since PHP
5.something. So the Example #1 is now invalid PHP code.

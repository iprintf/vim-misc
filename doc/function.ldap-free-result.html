ldap_free_result — Free result memory

说明

bool ldap_free_result ( resource $result_identifier )

Frees up the memory allocated internally to store the result. All result memory
will be automatically freed when the script terminates.

Typically all the memory allocated for the LDAP result gets freed at the end of
the script. In case the script is making successive searches which return large
result sets, ldap_free_result() could be called to keep the runtime memory
usage by the script low.

参数

result_identifier

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

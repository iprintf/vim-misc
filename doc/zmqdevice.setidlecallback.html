ZMQDevice::setIdleCallback — Set the idle callback function

说明

public ZMQDevice ZMQDevice::setIdleCallback ( callable $cb_func , integer
$timeout [, mixed $user_data ] )

Sets the idle callback function. If idle timeout is defined the idle callback
function shall be called if the internal poll loop times out without events. If
the callback function returns false or a value that evaluates to false the
device is stopped. The callback function signature is callback (mixed
$user_data).

参数

cb_func

    Callback function to invoke when the device is idle. Returning false or a
    value that evaluates to false from this function will cause the device to
    stop.

timeout

    How often to invoke the idle callback in milliseconds. The idle callback is
    invoked periodically when there is no activity on the device. The timeout
    value guarantees that there is at least this amount of milliseconds between
    invocations of the callback function.

user_data

    Additional data to pass to the callback function.

返回值

On success this method returns the current object.

You can also try using getmypid() instead.

In order to use posix_getpid on Fedeora 11 and up you have to install
php-process

# yum install php-process

Since upgrading fedora 10 to 12, I discovered that posix_getpid() disappeared
and not compiled in by default, as it specifies here.

It turns out that it had been moved into package php-process.

Just do "yum install php-process", and all should be sweet again.

Hope this saves someone half an hour of research.

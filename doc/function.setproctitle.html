===============================================================================

You should use cli_set_process_title() ( http://php.net/manual/en/
function.cli-set-process-title.php ) instead; it's less dangerous and less
buggy, and part of PHP itself as of 5.5.
===============================================================================

Note that this extension is considered buggy.  See https://wiki.php.net/rfc/
cli_process_title, which says:

"...but it is incomplete and might lead to memory corruption on Linux (or any
OS which does not support setproctitle.

The reason is the extension only has access to original argv[0] (that comes
from main()). argv and environ(7) are in contiguous memory space on Linux. The
extension presumes that argv[0] can accomodate 128 characters, but usually that
is not possible because argv[0] is “php”. When this happens, the extension will
scribble on argv[1], argv[2], etc., and maybe even environ and this can have
destructive side effects on the running program."

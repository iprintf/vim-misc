fann_save — Saves the entire network to a configuration file

说明

bool fann_save ( resource $ann , string $configuration_file )

Saves the entire network to a configuration file.

The configuration file contains all information about the neural network and
enables fann_create_from_file() to create an exact copy of the neural network
and all of the parameters associated with the neural network.

These three parameters (fann_set_callback(), fann_set_error_log(), 
fann_set_user_data()) are NOT saved to the file because they cannot safely be
ported to a different location. Also temporary parameters generated during
training like fann_get_MSE() is not saved.

参数

ann

    Neural network resource.

configuration_file

    The configuration file path.

返回值

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.

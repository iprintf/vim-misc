RarEntry::getStream — Get file handler for entry

说明

public resource RarEntry::getStream ([ string $password ] )

Returns a file handler that supports read operations. This handler provides
on-the-fly decompression for this entry.

The handler is not invalidated by calling rar_close().

Warning

The resulting stream has no integrity verification. In particular, file
corruption and decryption with a wrong a key will not be detected. It is the
programmer's responsability to use the entry's CRC to check for integrity, if
he so wishes.

参数

password

    The password used to encrypt this entry. If the entry is not encrypted,
    this value will not be used and can be omitted. If this parameter is
    omitted and the entry is encrypted, the password given to rar_open(), if
    any, will be used. If a wrong password is given, either explicitly or
    implicitly via rar_open(), this method's resulting stream will produce
    wrong output. If no password is given and one is required, this method will
    fail and return FALSE. You can check whether an entry is encrypted with 
    RarEntry::isEncrypted().

返回值

The file handler 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 RarEntry::getStream() example

<?php

$rar_file = rar_open('example.rar');
if ($rar_file === false)
    die("Failed to open Rar archive");

$entry = rar_entry_get($rar_file, 'Dir/file.txt');
if ($entry === false)
    die("Failed to find such entry");

$stream = $entry->getStream();
if ($stream === false)
    die("Failed to obtain stream.");

rar_close($rar_file); //stream is independent from file

while (!feof($stream)) {
    $buff = fread($stream, 8192);
    if ($buff !== false)
        echo $buff;
    else
        break; //fread error
}

fclose($stream);

?>

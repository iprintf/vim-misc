(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ldap_first_attribute — Return first attribute

说明

string ldap_first_attribute ( resource $link_identifier , resource
$result_entry_identifier )

Gets the first attribute in the given entry. Remaining attributes are retrieved
by calling ldap_next_attribute() successively.

Similar to reading entries, attributes are also read one by one from a
particular entry.

参数

link_identifier

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

result_entry_identifier

ber_identifier

    ber_identifier is the identifier to internal memory location pointer. It is
    passed by reference. The same ber_identifier is passed to 
    ldap_next_attribute() , which modifies that pointer.

        Note:

        This parameter is no longer used as this is now handled automatically
        by PHP. For backwards compatibility PHP will not throw an error if this
        parameter is passed.

返回值

Returns the first attribute in the entry on success and FALSE on error.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.2.4 The ber_identifier was removed. This is now handled automatically by PHP.

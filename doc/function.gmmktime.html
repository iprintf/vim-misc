gmmktime

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

gmmktime — 取得 GMT 日期的 UNIX 时间戳

说明

int gmmktime ([ int $hour [, int $minute [, int $second [, int $month [, int
$day [, int $year [, int $is_dst ]]]]]]] )

和 mktime() 完全一样，只除了返回值是格林威治标准时的时间戳。

参数总是表示 GMT 日期，因此 is_dst 对结果没有影响。

和 mktime() 一样，参数可以从右到左依次空着，空着的参数会被设为相应的当前 GMT 值
。

    Note:

    自 5.1.0 起，is_dst 参数被废弃。因此应该用新的时区处理特性。

    Note: gmmktime() 内部使用了 mktime()，因此只有转换成本地时间也合法的时间才
    能用在其中。 so only times valid in derived local time can be used.

Example #1 gmmktime() 在 Windows 中的边界

<?php
gmmktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1970); // 在 GMT 和西方合法，在东方不合法
?>

The interaction of timezones with unix timestamps is a bit tricky so I thought
I'd clarify so that people aren't led too far astray by Greg's and Glen's
comments. :)

In the POSIX standard, "unix time" does not have a specified timezone.  It is
universal.  For most intents and purposes you can think of them as always being
GMT/UTC.  (And you can derive the UTC time from a "timestamp" by dividing it by
86400 and looking at the modulus.)  Do not ever try to adjust a timestamp by a
timezone offset (specifically, do not ever use the code at the end of Glen's
note).  Timezones are basically used only when "rendering" a timestamp from
"unix time" into a "civil time" date/time string.

Let's take an example.  PST is GMT-8, and EST is GMT-5.  So when it is 3 AM in
PST, it is 6 AM in EST.  At that exact moment in time, the _timestamp_ is
identical in both time zones.  If I am sitting at my computer in PST, and you
are at yours in EST, and I call you up and read you the current unix timestamp
on my computer, it will match yours (assuming our clocks are both set
accurately for our timezone).

So, time() always will return the same thing at the same actual moment,
anywhere in the world.  gmmktime() and mktime(), when given specific time
parameters, convert those time parameters FROM the appropriate timezone (GMT
for gmmktime(), local time for mktime()), before computing the appropriate
timestamp.  Again, for most intents and purposes you can imagine that mktime()
first converts your input parameters to GMT and then calls gmmktime() which
produces a GMT timestamp.  (For the purposes of this explanation, please ignore
the fact that the PHP documentation says that internally gmmktime() calls
mktime().)

HOWEVER, when called with no arguments, gmmktime() uses the current GMT time,
and mktime() uses the current local time.  So, if you imagine the above
conversion taking place where mktime() converts the (current) local time to
GMT, it ends up essentially calling gmmktime() with the _current_ GMT time,
just like gmmktime() does all by itself.

This is why time(), gmmktime(), and mktime() all return the same exact
timestamp, _when called with no arguments_.  This is why Glen saw them all
produce the same thing.

Greg wrote that gmmktime() will return something different if you are not
sitting in the GMT timezone, but this is only true if you have given it
arguments from which to construct a timestamp.

So let's look at that situation again.  Say I am in PST and it's 3 AM PST. 
(And therefore it is 11 AM GMT.)  mktime() lets me override one field at at
time, and the first argument is, conveniently, the hour field.  So if I call
mktime(3), I get the same answer as mktime().  Makes sense, right?  I just told
it to give me the timestamp corresponding to 3 AM local time.  If I call
gmmktime(11), I get the same answer as gmmktime(), since it is currently 11 AM
GMT.  mktime(3) and gmmktime(11) refer to the same exact point in time, because
PST is 8 hours behind GMT.  So it makes sense that mktime(3) == gmmktime(11). 
And sine mktime() == mktime(3) (at this moment), and gmmktime() == gmmktime(11)
(at this moment), it makes sense that gmmktime() == mktime().

Now, back to Greg's note about gmmktime() being different.  With identical
arguments, their output will be different, e.g. mktime(3) != gmmktime(3).  This
makes sense because 3 AM PST != 3 AM GMT.

Okay, that should be all you need to know to deal with the interaction between
timestamps and timezones.  Don't ever try to convert timezones by adding or
subtracting to the timestamp.  Timestamps don't really have timezones, it is
apples and oranges, and you'll either get the wrong answer in some situations
or end up with code that no one can maintain.  Leave it up to the higher-level
PHP functions to do the conversion.  (If you want to hack things, strtotime is
handy and it can work with timezones; let it do the hard work for you.)

I had a problem with hosting a UK site on a US server, the times didnt match
(obviously) and also didnt account for daylight savings time. The daylight
savings dates and times of change differ worldwide, so detecting if the server
was in dst wouldnt work (see http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/).

Here is a function for creating a timestamp which can be used by date() to
create all the parameters required to display the local time (site not server).
I have used GMT time to create the timestamp as there is no offset for UK time
(+00).

<?php
function UKdst_time()
{
    // created by Matthew Waygood (www.waygoodstuff.co.uk)
    $timestamp = mktime(gmdate("H, i, s, m, d, Y")); // UTC time
    $this_year=gmdate("Y", $timestamp);

    // last sunday in march at 1am UTC
    $last_day_of_march=gmmktime(1,0,0,3,31,$this_year);
    $last_sunday_of_march=strtotime("-".gmdate("w", $last_day_of_march)." day",
$last_day_of_march);
   
    // last sunday in october at 1am UTC
    $last_day_of_october=gmmktime(1,0,0,10,31,$this_year);
    $last_sunday_of_october=strtotime("-".gmdate("w", $last_day_of_october)."
day", $last_day_of_october);

    if( ($timestamp > $last_sunday_of_march) && ($timestamp < 
$last_sunday_of_october) )
    {
        $timestamp=$timestamp+3600; // foward one hour
    }
    return $timestamp;
}
?>
===============================================================================

GMT time is useful for avoiding the daylight's savings issue.  I had to use it
to get a working date difference function:

<?php
function dateDiff($date1, $date2) //returns the difference, in days, between
two dates.  avoids the daylight's savings issue by using GMT
{
    $date1 = date_parse($date1);
    $date2 = date_parse($date2);
    return ((gmmktime(0, 0, 0, $date1['month'], $date1['day'], $date1['year'])
- gmmktime(0, 0, 0, $date2['month'], $date2['day'], $date2['year']))/3600/24);
}
?>

Here's a play on turgut85's countDays function.  I've found it to be more
efficient and it accepts unix timestamps rather than arrays.  Thanks for the
ideas.

<?php
function count_days($start, $end) {
  // Count the days between $start and $end where both $start and $end
  //  are UNIX timestamps
 
  // Swap the two values if end is greater than start (to avoid the
  //  loop of death).
  if ($start < $end) {
    $t = $start;
    $start = $end;
    $end = $t;
  }
 
  // Increment the start time by one day until it is equal to the
  //  end time
 
  $days = 0;
  while ( $start < $end ) {
    $start = strtotime("+1 days", $start);
    $days++;
  }
 
  return $days;
}
?>

mwwaygoo's code isn't quite right. My understanding is that the relevant dates
for changing between daylight saving time in the UK is the third sunday of
march and october - not the last sunday!
===============================================================================

Beware that despite the documentation which states is_dst is ignored, with PHP
5.2 at least, it is not actually ignored and will cause a 1 hour offset on the
UTC time returned.

This caused some interesting bugs, especially with the tzdelta function shown
from previous posts below - you need to make the final parameter a 0 instead of
$ar[8] otherwise you get an off-by-1-hour as a result.

As a result, I now use :

<?php
function tzdelta ( $iTime = 0 ) {
        if ( 0 == $iTime ) { $iTime = time(); }
        $ar = localtime ( $iTime );
        $ar[5] += 1900; $ar[4]++;
        $iTztime = gmmktime ( $ar[2], $ar[1], $ar[0], $ar[4], $ar[3], $ar[5], 0
);
        return ( $iTztime - $iTime );
}
?>

Here is a handy routine for counting down to the minute, hour, and day to a

<?php

        $timeleft = (floor($minutesleft/60) == 1 ? '1 hour' : floor(
$minutesleft/60).' hours');
      }
      else if ($minutesleft >= (24*60)) {
        $days = floor($minutesleft / (24*60));
        // hours remainder
        $hours = ($minutesleft % (24*60)) / 60;
        // hours left in the day
        $hours_left = ((time() / 60) % (24*60)) / 60;
        // see if the remainder of hours is greater than the hours left in
today, if so increase the days by one so that the days remaining mimics the
date rather than how many 24 hour periods there are between now and then.
        if($hours > $hours_left) {
          $days++;
        }
        $timeleft = ($days == 1 ? '1 day' : $days.' days');

REF: http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/sumtimetb.htm

Since 1981 EC Directives have prescribed the start and end dates of summer time
in all Member States.  There have to date been eight Directives which have set
summer-time arrangements for fixed periods. The Summer Time Act 1972 sets the
appropriate dates in the UK and summer-time orders have been made as necessary
to implement the European Directives. The 9th EC Directive prescribes the start
and end dates of summer time as the last Sundays in March and October
respectively. These dates are in line with those already operating in the
United Kingdom. The 9th Directive provides that these start and end dates
should apply indefinitely.
---
9th EC Directive - 19 January 2001

Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive "summer-time period" shall mean the period
of the year during which clocks are put forward by 60 minutes compared with the
rest of the year.

Article 2
From 2002 onwards, the summer-time period shall begin, in every Member State,
at 1.00 a.m., Greenwich Mean Time, on the last Sunday in March.

Article 3
From 2002 onwards, the summer-time period shall end, in every Member State, at
1.00 a.m., Greenwich Mean Time, on the last Sunday in October.

You stand corrected ;-)  (well up until 2007 anyway)

There appears to be a discrepency between PHP and C timestamps.  The C time()
and gettimeofday() functions are documented to return based on UTC time, but
the value obtained doesn't match the PHP gmmktime() function.  Instead, it
matches the PHP mktime() function, which is supposed to be local time.
  
It seems that C always uses a UTC timestamp and adjusts to local time through
different handling functions (gmtime() vs localtime()).  PHP appears to use
differing UTC/local timestamps, but single handling functions.

The exception to this rule is the PHP time() function, which appears to behave
in the same was as the C version.

In short, if your PHP is working with timestamps created in C (or vice versa)
make sure you are comparing apples to apples.
===============================================================================

When attempting to use HTTP's If-Modified-Since features for caching I ran into
the problem of being able to compare the GMT date the browser was sending to my
own Last-Modified date (stored in a database field). I saw many examples of how
to create a GMT date from a unix timestamp, but little on how to actually get a
GMT date into a unix timestamp. Perhaps someone has a better way, here's my
solution:

<?php

function gmstrtotime($sgm) {
    $months = array(
      'Jan'=>1,
      'Feb'=>2,
      'Mar'=>3,
      'Apr'=>4,
      'May'=>5,
      'Jun'=>6,
      'Jul'=>7,
      'Aug'=>8,
      'Sep'=>9,
      'Oct'=>10,
      'Nov'=>11,
      'Dec'=>12
    );
    list($D, $d, $M, $Y, $H, $i, $s) = sscanf($sgm, "%3s, %2d %3s %4d
%2d:%2d:%2d GMT");
    return gmmktime($H, $i, $s, $months[$M], $d, $Y);
}

// test: after all is said and done
// $time should be the same as $gmtime

$time = time();
$us = date("m/d/Y H:i:s",$time);
$sgm = gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s",$time) . " GMT";

$gmtime = gmstrtotime($sgm);

echo $us . "<BR>";
echo $sgm . "<BR>";
echo $time . "<BR>";
echo $gmtime . "<BR>";

?>

My results:

I have seen many different hacked versions of this function for people using

the others I have seen!

In addition to GLEN's post on DEC 5th 2007

(Just a note for others)

The results for the three time types Glen listed under "returns" all returned
the exact same timestamp
- 1196812966

Using those three functions will only make the exact same timestamp if the
server the code is executed on IS in GMT timezone.

'mktime()' and 'time()' will both return the timestamp for your server time,
and will both be the same as eachother.
gmmktime will return a GMT timestamp.

So if run on a server that is NOT in the GMT timezone then gmmktime will return
a different timestamp to the other two.
===============================================================================

As an addendum to my previous note (php.net said it was too long and I had to
split this part off), I'll leave you with one more fun tidbit. :)

(See the note below this one for a full explanation of timezones versus unix
timestamps.)

3 AM PST == 11 AM GMT, right?  11 AM _GMT_ > 3 AM _GMT_ (same timezone) right? 
So, logically, 3 AM PST > 3 AM GMT.  (Makes sense right, it is 3 AM in
California 8 hours after it is 3 AM in Greenwich.)  Now, because timestamps are
timezone-independent (or, always GMT/UTC), you get a strange situation.  mktime
(3) > gmmktime(3).  Even though PST is GMT-8, so PST is less than GMT, mktime
(3) is _greater_ than gmmktime(3).  At first glance you'd probably expect
mktime(3) to be less than gmmktime(3), but because of everything I described
before, about how timestamps are always GMT/UTC (or, in some senses, no
timezone at all), it ends up being "backwards."  (Run a few examples yourself
if you don't believe me.)  Yet another reason not to try to deal with timezones
at the timestamp level!
===============================================================================

gmmktime() should ONLY be used to create a timestamp when specifying a specific
GMT date and time.

If you want to make a valid time stamp for the current date & time, use mktime
() instead.

UNIX timestamps, by definition, store the GMT time relative to the UNIX epoch.

gmmktime() (without any parameters specified) will effectively use the
computer's LOCAL time values just the same as if they were explicit parameters,
and the resulting time stamp will be incorrect.  (The resulting timestamp will
actually be offset in the OPPOSITE direction of the local timezone offset from
GMT!)

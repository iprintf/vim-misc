mhash_keygen_s2k — Generates a key

说明

string mhash_keygen_s2k ( int $hash , string $password , string $salt , int
$bytes )

Generates a key according to the given hash, using an user provided password.

This is the Salted S2K algorithm as specified in the OpenPGP document (» RFC
2440).

Keep in mind that user supplied passwords are not really suitable to be used as
keys in cryptographic algorithms, since users normally choose keys they can
write on keyboard. These passwords use only 6 to 7 bits per character (or
less). It is highly recommended to use some kind of transformation (like this
function) to the user supplied key.

参数

hash

    The hash ID used to create the key. One of the MHASH_hashname constants.

password

    An user supplied password.

salt

    Must be different and random enough for every key you generate in order to
    create different keys. Because salt must be known when you check the keys,
    it is a good idea to append the key to it. Salt has a fixed length of 8
    bytes and will be padded with zeros if you supply less bytes.

bytes

    The key length, in bytes.

返回值

Returns the generated key as a string, or FALSE on error.

I looked into mhash and PHP source code and I've ported this function to pure
PHP:

<?php

function keygen_s2k($hash, $password, $salt, $bytes)
{
    $result = false;

    if (extension_loaded('hash') === true)
    {
        $times = $bytes / ($block = strlen(hash($hash, null, true)));

        if ($bytes % $block != 0)
        {
            ++$times;
        }

        for ($i = 0; $i < $times; ++$i)
        {
            $result .= hash($hash, str_repeat("\0", $i) . $salt . $password, 
true);
        }
    }

    return $result;
}

?>

Correction to ray ferguson post,

As said in the doc : "mhash_keygen_s2k generates a key that is bytes long, from
a user given password and use the specified hash algorithm to create the key."
if It wasn't clear to anyone.

The non mhash function is good as long you do not need a key longer than native
MD5 hash (16 bytes)  it wont give you more.

So the non mhash function work OK but they ARE NOT the same thing.

Just try ray ferguson exemple asking for a 32 bytes key.

Returning a substring longer than the packed 16 bytes string won't add anything
to the string. Salted S2K algorithm does add to the key.  So better use mhash
lib or create something more alike the RFC 2440 specs.

I know the post is late on regard to Ray's post but if it can help someone not
waisting time like me.

// given random 8 bits of salt and a clear text password

$clear_pw = "p4ssw0rd" ;
$rand8bites4salt = substr(pack("h*", md5(mt_rand())) , 0, 8);

// This

mhash_keygen_s2k(MHASH_MD5, $clear_pw, $rand8bites4salt, 4) ;

//is the same as this

function myhash_keyge_s2k($pass, $salt, $bytes ){
      return substr(pack("H*", md5($salt . $pass)), 0, $bytes);
}

myhash_keyge_s2k($clear_pw, $rand8bites4salt, 4);

// But the latter doesn't require mhash libs.

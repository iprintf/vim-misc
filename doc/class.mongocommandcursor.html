The MongoCommandCursor class

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

Introduction

A command cursor is similar to a MongoCursor except that you use it for
iterating through the results of a database command instead of a normal query.
Command cursors are useful for iterating over large result sets that might
exceed the document size limit (currently 16MB) of a single MongoDB::command()
response.

While you can create command cursors using MongoCommandCursor::__construct() or
the MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument() factory method, you will generally
want to use command-specific helpers such as MongoCollection::aggregateCursor()
.

Note that the cursor does not "contain" the database command's results; it just
manages iteration through them. Thus, if you print a cursor (f.e. with var_dump
() or print_r()), you will see the cursor object but not the result documents.

Cursor Stages

A MongoCommandCursor has two "life stages": pre- and post- command. When a
cursor is created, it has not yet contacted the database, so it is in its
pre-command state. When the client first attempts to get a result (by calling 
MongoCommandCursor::rewind(), directly or indirectly), the cursor moves into
the post-command state.

The command cursor's batch size and socket timeout may be configured in both
the pre- and post- command states.

Example #1 Adding options to MongoCommandCursor

<?php

$cursor = new MongoCommandCursor(...);

$cursor = $cursor->batchSize( 4 );

foreach ($cursor as $result) {
    var_dump($result);
}
?>

===============================================================================

mailparse_msg_extract_part_file() does not support file-wrappers as it needs to
be able to use seek() on the file.
===============================================================================

Be aware of "corporate mails" or users who do not understand character encoding
too deeply (or do not care). You may (as we did) face mail where the whole mail
body is encoded used i.e. Latin2 (and iso-8859-2 is given in multipart's
charset header) but at the same time the body also contains text footer with
UTF-8 characters in it... Yes, fu*g Microsoft Exchange V6.5 frontent will show
that fine on the screen, but if when receive it:

mailparse_msg_extract_part_file() - filter conversion failed. Input message is
probably incorrectly encoded in ....

so be extra careful and deal with all the possible errors to avoid mail loss.

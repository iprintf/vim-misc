===============================================================================

getImageRegion has the same side effect that was mentioned for operations that
change the crop of the image -- the new image preserves the old canvas and
positioning info. For example, using annotateImage on the new image will
interpret the positioning arguments relative to the old image. To correct it,
reset this info with setImagePage.

<?php
$im->setImagePage(0, 0, 0, 0);
?>

serialize

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

serialize — 产生一个可存储的值的表示

描述

string serialize ( mixed $value )

serialize() 返回字符串，此字符串包含了表示 value 的字节流，可以存储于任何地方。

这有利于存储或传递 PHP 的值，同时不丢失其类型和结构。

想要将已序列化的字符串变回 PHP 的值，可使用 unserialize()。serialize() 可处理除
了 resource 之外的任何类型。甚至可以 serialize() 那些包含了指向其自身引用的数组
。你正 serialize() 的数组／对象中的引用也将被存储。

当序列化对象时，PHP 将试图在序列动作之前调用该对象的成员函数 __sleep()。这样就
允许对象在被序列化之前做任何清除操作。类似的，当使用 unserialize() 恢复对象时，
将调用 __wakeup() 成员函数。

    Note:

    在 PHP 3 中，对象属性将被序列化，但是方法则会丢失。PHP 4 打破了此限制，可以
    同时存储属性和方法。请参见类与对象中的序列化对象部分获取更多信息。

Example #1 serialize() 示例

<?php
// $session_data 是包含了当前用户 session 信息的多维数组。
// 我们使用 serialize() 在请求结束之前将其存储到数据库中。

$conn = odbc_connect ("webdb", "php", "chicken");
$stmt = odbc_prepare ($conn,
      "UPDATE sessions SET data = ? WHERE id = ?");
$sqldata = array (serialize($session_data), $PHP_AUTH_USER);
if (!odbc_execute ($stmt, &$sqldata)) {
    $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn,
     "INSERT INTO sessions (id, data) VALUES(?, ?)");
    if (!odbc_execute($stmt, &$sqldata)) {
    /* 出错 */
    }
}
?>

Please! please! please! DO NOT serialize data and place it into your database.
Serialize can be used that way, but that's missing the point of a relational
database and the datatypes inherent in your database engine. Doing this makes
data in your database non-portable, difficult to read, and can complicate
queries. If you want your application to be portable to other languages, like
let's say you find that you want to use Java for some portion of your app that
it makes sense to use Java in, serialization will become a pain in the
buttocks. You should always be able to query and modify data in the database
without using a third party intermediary tool to manipulate data to be
inserted.

I've encountered this too many times in my career, it makes for difficult to
maintain code, code with portability issues, and data that is it more difficult
to migrate to other RDMS systems, new schema, etc. It also has the added
disadvantage of making it messy to search your database based on one of the
fields that you've serialized.

That's not to say serialize() is useless. It's not... A good place to use it
may be a cache file that contains the result of a data intensive operation, for
instance. There are tons of others... Just don't abuse serialize because the
next guy who comes along will have a maintenance or migration nightmare.
===============================================================================

Serializing floating point numbers leads to weird precision offset errors:

<?php

echo round(96.670000000000002, 2);
// 96.67

echo serialize(round(96.670000000000002, 2));
// d:96.670000000000002;

echo serialize(96.67);
// d:96.670000000000002;

?>

Not only is this wrong, but it adds a lot of unnecessary bulk to serialized
data. Probably better to use json_encode() instead (which apparently is faster
than serialize(), anyway).
===============================================================================

Closures cannot be serialized:
<?php
$func = function () {echo 'hello!';};
$func(); // prints "hello!"

$result = serialize($func);  // Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception'
with message 'Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed'
?>
===============================================================================

If you are going to serialie an object which contains references to other
objects you want to serialize some time later, these references will be lost
when the object is unserialized.
The references can only be kept if all of your objects are serialized at once.
That means:

$a = new ClassA();
$b = new ClassB($a); //$b containes a reference to $a;

$s1=serialize($a);
$s2=serialize($b);

$a=unserialize($s1);
$b=unserialize($s2);

now b references to an object of ClassA which is not $a. $a is another object
of Class A.

use this:
$buf[0]=$a;
$buf[1]=$b;
$s=serialize($buf);
$buf=unserialize($s);
$a=$buf[0];
$b=$buf[1];

all references are intact.
===============================================================================

Warning: on 64 bits machines,  if you use a long string only composed of
numbers as a key in an array and serialize/unserialize it, you can run into
problems:

an example code:
$arr["20041001103319"] = 'test';
var_dump( $arr);
$arr_in_str = serialize($arr);
print "Now result is: $arr_in_str<BR />";
$final_arr = unserialize($arr_in_str);
print "The final unserialized array:<BR />";
var_dump($final_arr);

The result:
array(1) { [20041001103319]=>  string(4) "test" }
Now result is: a:1:{i:20041001103319;s:4:"test";}
The final unserialized array:
array(1) { [683700183]=> string(4) "test" }

As you can see, the original array :
$arr["20041001103319"] = "test"

after serialize/unserialize is:
$arr[683700183] = "test"

As you can see,  the key has changed ...

Apparently a problem of implicit casting + integer overflow (I posted a PHP bug
report: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=31117)

I tested with the latest 4.3.10 compiled on my laptop (32 bits, Mandrake 9.1)
--> no such problem. But compiled on AMD 64 bits (Red Hat Taroon), the problem
is present.

Hope this will help some of you to not loose almost a whole day of debugging ;

===============================================================================

I have also written some code for importing serialized PHP data into PERL and
then writing it back into PHP.  I think the similar library posted above is
actually more robust for a few select cases, but mine is more compact and a
little easier to follow.  I'd really like comments if anyone finds this useful
or has improvements.  Please credit me if you use my code.

When you serialize an array the internal pointer will not be preserved.
Apparently this is the expected behavior but was a bit of a gotcha moment for
me. Copy and paste example below.

<?php
//Internal Pointer will be 2 once variables have been assigned.
$array = array();
$array[] = 1;
$array[] = 2;
$array[] = 3;

//Unset variables. Internal pointer will still be at 2.    
unset($array[0]);
unset($array[1]);
unset($array[2]);

//Serialize
$serializeArray = serialize($array);

//Unserialize
$array = unserialize($serializeArray);

//Add a new element to the array
//If the internal pointer was preserved, the new array key should be 3.
//Instead the internal pointer has been reset, and the new array key is 0.
$array[] = 4;

//Expected Key - 3
//Actual Key - 0
echo "<pre>" , print_r($array, 1) , "</pre>";
?>
===============================================================================

In my specific situation, I wanted to be able to pass some data from page to
page, but without relying on a session variable. The answer I came up with was
to serialize() the object in question, pass it on to the next page as a hidden
form field, then unserialize() it. When ALL class variables are public, this
worked fine. However, if there was at least one private/protected variable, the
code no longer worked as expected ("Fatal error: Call to a member function
display() on a non-object in page2.php on line 4")

As others have already mentioned, private/protected class variables will not
behave nicely (private variables are prefixed by class_name + &#65533;, while
protected variables are only prefixed by &#65533; - when looking at the page
source using Firefox). Internet Explorer does NOT display the extra character
between the class name and variable name, but the code still doesn't work as
one would expect.

Suppose you have a simple class:

testclass.php
=============
<?php
class TestClass {
  var $i = 1;

  function display() {
    echo "i=" . $this->i;
  }
?>

page1.php
=========
<?php
  require_once 'testclass.php';
  $tc = new TestClass;
  $tc->display();
?>
<form method = "post" action = "page2.php">
<input type = "hidden" name = "str" value = "<?php echo htmlspecialchars( 
serialize( $tc ) ); ?>">
<input type = "submit">
</form>

page2.php
=========
<?php
  require_once 'testclass.php';
  $tc = unserialize( stripslashes( htmlspecialchars_decode( $_POST["str"] ) )
);
  $tc->display();
?>

The fix, suggested by evulish on #php/irc.dal.net, is to replace
htmlspecialchars()/htmlspecialchars_decode() by base64_encode()/base64_decode.
The code becomes:

page1.php
=========
<input type = "hidden" name = "str" value = "<?php echo base64_encode( 
serialize( $tc ) ); ?>">

page2.php
=========
<?php
  $tc = unserialize( base64_decode( $_POST["str"] ) );
?>

Hope this will help someone...

I did some testing to see the speed differences between serialize and
json_encode, and my results with 250 iterations are:

PHP serialized in 0.0651714730263 seconds average
JSON encoded in 0.0254955434799 seconds average
json_encode() was roughly 155.62% faster than serialize()
Test took 27.2039430141 seconds with 300 iretations.

PHP serialized in 0.0564563179016 seconds average
JSON encoded in 0.0249140485128 seconds average
json_encode() was roughly 126.60% faster than serialize()
Test took 24.4148340225 seconds with 300 iretations.

From all my tests it looks like json_encode is on average about 120% faster
(sometimes it gets to about 85% and sometimes to 150%).

Here is the PHP code you can run on your server to try it out:

<?php

// fillArray function myde by Peter Bailey
function fillArray($depth, $max){
    static $seed;
    if (is_null($seed)){
        $seed = array('a', 2, 'c', 4, 'e', 6, 'g', 8, 'i', 10);
    }
    if ($depth < $max){
        $node = array();
        foreach ($seed as $key){
            $node[$key] = fillArray( $depth + 1, $max );
        }
        return $node;
    }
    return 'empty';
}

function testSpeed($testArray, $iterations = 100){

    $json_time = array();
    $serialize_time = array();
    $test_start = microtime(true);

    for ($x = 1; $x <= $iterations; $x++){
        $start = microtime(true);
        json_encode($testArray);
        $json_time[] = microtime(true) - $start;

        $start = microtime(true);
        serialize($testArray);
        $serialize_time[] = microtime(true) - $start;
    }

    $test_lenght = microtime(true) - $test_start;
    $json_average = array_sum($json_time) / count($json_time);
    $serialize_average = array_sum($serialize_time) / count($serialize_time);

    $result = "PHP serialized in ".$serialize_average." seconds average<br>";
    $result .= "JSON encoded in ".$json_average." seconds average<br>";

    if ($json_average < $serialize_average){
        $result .= "json_encode() was roughly ".number_format( (
$serialize_average / $json_average - 1 ) * 100, 2 )."% faster than serialize()
<br>";
    } else if ( $serializeTime < $jsonTime ){
        $result .= "serialize() was roughly ".number_format( ($json_average / 
$serialize_average - 1 ) * 100, 2 )."% faster than json_encode()<br>";
    } else {
        $result .= "No way!<br>";
    }

    $result .= "Test took ".$test_lenght." seconds with ".$iterations."
iterations.";

    return $result;

}

// Change the number of iterations (250) to lower if you exceed your maximum
execution time
echo testSpeed(fillArray(0, 5), 250);

Note : You cannot save the state of a static variable by serializing.
<?php
/*
* student.class.php
*/
class Student {

    public $name;
    private $roll;
    protected $age;
    static $class;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->name = "Nanhe Kumar";
        $this->roll = 1;
        $this->age = 16;
        Student::$class = "10+2";
    }

}
?>
<?php
/**
* serialize.php
*/
include_once("student.class.php");

//Serialize
$so = new Student();
$serialized = serialize($so);
file_put_contents("test.txt", $serialized);
echo $serialized; //O:7:"Student":3:{s:4:"name";s:11:"Nanhe Kumar";
s:13:"Studentroll";i:1;s:6:"*age";i:16;}
?>
<?php
/**
* unserialize.php
*/
include_once("student.class.php");
$content = file_get_contents("test.txt");
$unserialized = unserialize($content);
print_r($unserialized);//Student Object ( [name] => Nanhe Kumar
[roll:Student:private] => 1 [age:protected] => 16 )
?>
===============================================================================

Regarding serializing PHP data types to Javascript, following Ivans note below,
theres an example at http://www.tekool.net/php/js_serializer/.

The basic serialization looks good although, in its current form, it works on
the basis of generating Javascript source which a browser executes as a page
loads. Using Javascripts eval() the same can be done with strings containing
Javascript if youre working with something like XMLHTTPRequest
===============================================================================

Corrections/clarifications to  "Anatomy of a serialize()'ed value":

All strings appear inside quotes. This applies to string values, object class
names and array key names. For example:

s:3:"foo"
O:7:"MyClass":1:{...
a:2:{s:3:"bar";i:42;...

Object property names and values are delimited by semi-colons, not colons. For
example:

O:7:"MyClass":2:{s:3:"foo";i:10;s:3:"bar";i:20}

Double/float values are represented as:

d:0.23241446
===============================================================================

Oddly, if you serialize a class that was previously unserialized, the class of
the variable changes to string... Example:

$R = unserialize($serialized_object);
$R->method(); // this is ok
$str = serialize($R);
echo(get_class($R));

this will output "string"!!!!! whereas if the first line was

$R = new my_class();

it would output "my_class"!

I don't know if that is a bug, but the manual is not clear about that! (somehow
$R in serialize($R) is being passed by reference, since it changes class).
===============================================================================

Another suggestion for coping with binary data in serialize()d variables is
just to base64_encode() those fields before serializing. It will increase the
size of the variable, but not by too much.
===============================================================================

I was trying to submit a serialized array through a hidden form field using
POST and was having a lot of trouble with the quotes. I couldn't figure out a
way to escape the quotes in the string so that they'd show up right inside the
form, so only the characters up to the first set of quotes were being sent.

My solution was to base64_encode() the string, put that in the hidden form
field, and send that through the POST method. Then I decoded it (using
base64_decode()) on the other end. This seemed to solve the problem.
===============================================================================

If serializing objects to be stored into a postgresql database, the 'null byte'
injected for private and protected members throws a wrench into the system.
Even pg_escape_bytea() on the value, and storing the value as a binary type
fails under certain circumstances.

For a dirty work around:
<?php

$serialized_object = serialize($my_object);
$safe_object = str_replace("\0", "~~NULL_BYTE~~", $serialized_object);

?>

this allows you to store the object in a readable text format as well. When
reading the data back:

<?php

$serialized_object = str_replace("~~NULL_BYTE~~", "\0", $safe_object);
$my_object = unserialize($serialized_object);

?>

The only gotcha's with this method is if your object member names or values may
somehow contain the odd "~~NULL_BYTE~~" string. If that is the case, then
str_replace() to a string that you are guaranteed not to have any where else in
the string that serialize() returns.
Also remember to define the class before calling unserialize().

If you are storing session data into a postgresql database, then this
workaround is an absolute must, because the $data passed to the session's write
function is already serialized.

Thanks,
Travis Hegner
===============================================================================

If you are serializing an object to store it in the database, using __sleep()
can save you some space. The following code will not store empty (null)
variables in the serialized string. For my purposes this saved a lot of space,
since some of the member variables would not be given values.

function __sleep()
{
    $allVars = get_object_vars($this);
    $toReturn = array();
    foreach(array_keys($allVars) as $name)
    {
        if (isset($this->$name))
        {
            $toReturn[] = $name;
        }
    }
    return $toReturn;
}
===============================================================================

Here is an example of a base class to implement object persistence using
serialize and unserialize:

<?php
class Persistent
{
    var $filename;
       
    /**********************/
    function Persistent($filename)
    {
        $this->filename = $filename;
        if(!file_exists($this->filename)) $this->save();
    }
    /**********************/
    function save()
    {
        if($f = @fopen($this->filename,"w"))
        {
            if(@fwrite($f,serialize(get_object_vars($this))))
            {
                @fclose($f);
            }
            else die("Could not write to file ".$this->filename." at
Persistant::save");
        }
        else die("Could not open file ".$this->filename." for writing, at
Persistant::save");
       
    }
    /**********************/
    function open()
    {
        $vars = unserialize(file_get_contents($this->filename));
        foreach($vars as $key=>$val)
        {           
            eval("$"."this->$key = $"."vars['"."$key'];");
        }
    }
    /**********************/
}

?>

When an object is extended from this one it can be easily saved and re-opened
using it's own methods as follows:

<?

class foo extends Persistent
{
   var $counter;
   function inc()
   {
       $this->counter++;
   }
}

$fooObj = new $foo;
$foo->open();
print $foo->counter; // displays incrementing integer as page reloads
$foo->inc();
$foo->save();

?>
===============================================================================

For everyone facing the conversion nightmare another Anonymous described here
in an older comment (and he took the words out of my mouth), this T-SQL script
might be of great help: https://github.com/mjohnsonperl/tsqlphpunserialize/tree
/master.

Please do not follow the path of evil by dumping serialized data into
relational databases.
===============================================================================

you should really use mysql_real_escape_string() for escaping (serialized)
strings that got thrown into a query (visit php.net/mysql_real_escape_string
for further information)
===============================================================================

It may be worth noting that, depending on the size of the object you are
serializing, the serialize function can take up a lot of memory.

If your script isn't working as expected, your serialize call may have pushed
the memory usage over the limit set by memory_limit in php.ini.

More info on memory limits here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php
===============================================================================

When using serialize() to convert, say, an array to a string to pass via HTML
forms, you will likely run into issues with quoting. This is because serialize
() puts values in double quotes. The simplest solution is to quote your HTML
form value with single quotes rather than double quotes. (This *is* allowed,
according to W3C specs.)

So, instead of:

<?php
$arr = serialize($some_array);
?>
<input type="hidden" name="array" value="$arr" />

you would want to use:

<?php
$arr = serialize($some_array);
?>
<input type="hidden" name="array" value='$arr' />
===============================================================================

NOTE: php's serialize does not properly serialize arrays with which a slice of
the array is a reference to the array itself, observe:

<?php
$a = array();
$a[0] = "blah";
$a[1] =& $a;

$a[1][0] = "pleh"; // $a[0] === "pleh"

$b = unserialize(serialize($a));

// $b[0] == "pleh", $b[1][0] == "pleh"

$b[1][0] = "blah";
?>

now $b[1][0] == "blah", but $b[0] == "pleh"
after serializing and unserializing, slice 1 is no longer a reference to the
array itself... I have found no way around this problem... even manually
modifying the serialized string from
'a:2:{i:0;s:4:"pleh";i:1;a:2:{i:0;s:4:"pleh";i:1;R:3;}}'
to
'a:2:{i:0;s:4:"pleh";i:1;R:1;}'

to force the second slice to be a reference to the first element of the
serialization (the array itself), it seemed to work at first glance, but then
unreferences it when you alter it again, observe:

<?php
    $testser = 'a:2:{i:0;s:4:"pleh";i:1;R:1;}';

    $tmp = unserialize($testser);

    print_r($tmp);

    print "\n-----------------------\n";

    $tmp[1][0] = "blah";

    print_r($tmp);

?>

outputs:
Array
(
    [0] => pleh
    [1] => Array
*RECURSION*
)

-----------------------
Array
(
    [0] => pleh
    [1] => Array
        (
            [0] => blah
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [0] => pleh
                    [1] => Array
*RECURSION*
                )

        )

)
===============================================================================

A call to serialize() appears to mess with the array's internal pointer.  If
you're going to be walking through your array after serializing it, you'll want
to make a call to reset() first.
===============================================================================

I needed to serialize an array to store it inside a database.
I was looking for a fast, simple way to do serialization, and I came out with 2
options: serialize() or json_encode().

I ran some benchmarks to see which is the faster, and, surprisingly, I found
that serialize() is always between 46% and 96% SLOWER than json_encode().
So, if you don't need to serialize objects and have the json extension
available, consider using it instead of serialize().
===============================================================================

I have problem to use serialize function with hidden form field and the
resolution was use htmlentities.

Ex.:

<?

$lista = array( 'pera', 'maça', 'laranja' );

print "< input type='hidden' name='teste' value='htmlentities( serialize(
$lista ) )'" >";

?>

odbc_result

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

odbc_result — Get result data

说明

mixed odbc_result ( resource $result_id , mixed $field )

Get result data

参数

result_id

    The ODBC resource.

field

    The field name being retrieved. It can either be an integer containing the
    column number of the field you want; or it can be a string containing the
    name of the field.

返回值

Returns the string contents of the field, FALSE on error, NULL for NULL data,
or TRUE for binary data.

范例

The first call to odbc_result() returns the value of the third field in the
current record of the query result. The second function call to odbc_result()
returns the value of the field whose field name is "val" in the current record
of the query result. An error occurs if a column number parameter for a field
is less than one or exceeds the number of columns (or fields) in the current
record. Similarly, an error occurs if a field with a name that is not one of
the fieldnames of the table(s) that is(are) being queried.

Example #1 odbc_result() examples

<?php
$item_3   = odbc_result($Query_ID, 3);
$item_val = odbc_result($Query_ID, "val");
?>

注释

Field indices start from 1. Regarding the way binary or long column data is
returned refer to odbc_binmode() and odbc_longreadlen().

Problem: Function returns a max of 4095 bytes of a cell with one call.

Tip: If you have a cell containing more than 4095 bytes, write a loop and call
the cell over and over as long return is not "". All returns can be added up to
the whole string.
===============================================================================

The odbc_result() function has an apparently little known feature that comes in
very handy when retrieving large text or binary fields.
Consider this code snippet to retrieve a large value into a temporary file
(error testing left out for clarity):

<?php
$con=odbc_connect(...);
$query="set textsize 2147483647 ".
       "select someLargeField from ...";
$resultset=odbc_exec($con,$query);
odbc_binmode($resultset,ODBC_BINMODE_RETURN);
odbc_longreadlen($resultset,4096);
while (odbc_fetch_row($resultset)) {
   $fileHandle=fopen('/tmp/myfile','wb');
   while (($chunk=odbc_result($resultset,'someLargeField'))!==false) {
      fwrite($fileHandle,$chunk);
   }
   fclose($fileHandle);
   //do something with the file
}
?>

There are a few key points to make it work:
- Make sure to include "set textsize 2147483647 " in your query.
  Without it, MSSQL truncates large values to 4096 bytes by default.
  Other databases may have a similar small limit.
- The odbc_binmode() and odbc_longreadlen() calls are just for safety.
  Their defaults in php.ini are usually correct.
- Each odbc_result() call on a large field apparently returns the next chunk.
  Of course you have to read all chunks before the next odbc_fetch_row() call.
- When all of the large value has been read, odbc_result() will return false.

Note: Using mssql_ instead of odbc_ functions is not a viable alternative. They
don't work with chunks (AFAIK) and even crash php (overflow, segmentation
fault) when the query result contains a large value.
===============================================================================

From http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.odbc-longreadlen.php but relevant
here, also.

An alternative is to adjust your php.ini file and set:
odbc.defaultlrl=65536
Or something else sufficiently large.
lrl = long read length

to get around the limit on returned chars.
===============================================================================

i use odbc and mysql and i noticed after losing a lot of time that if you write
something like this:
echo odbc_result($result,1);
....
echo odbc_result($result,1);
the second echo will fail. so it's more useful to save the result of
odbc_result in a variable and use it later
like that: $var=odbc_result($result,1);
i hope this will be useful!
===============================================================================

if you want to quickly change a website from odbc- to mysql-data-access, you
could use a simple function like this one:
function myresult ($cur,$nr) {
   return mysql_result($cur,0,mysql_field_name($cur,$nr-1));
}
and just do a global replace from "odbc_result" to "myresult".

beware, you should only use this if you don't care too much about performance,
as this will start a query for every field you request - the better way is of
course using mysql_fetch_row!
===============================================================================

When trying to get a date/time field from an Access database, odbc_result
returns the date as text (e.g. 1998-07-11 21:12:23). You may use strtotime
function to convert this into a format which can be used with PHP.

e.g.
echo "The date is "
.date("r",strtotime(odbc_result($myquery,"mydate")));
===============================================================================

With an Access 2K database, odbc_result will only work the first time it is
called on a memo field (odbc_field_type returns 'LONGCHAR').

$good = odbc_result($result,'Description');
# $good holds the field value
$fail = odbc_result($result,'Description');
# $fail holds false

This tripped me up when I did something like this:

for ($i=1; $i<=odbc_num_fields($result); $i++) {
  if(odbc_result($result,$i)){
    ... more code ...
    echo odbc_result($result,$i);
    ... snip ...
  }
}

For any field type except memo, this code works perfectly.  But on memo fields,
odbc_result returns false on the second call and nothing is echoed.

Be careful, use a temporary variable instead of multiple calls to odbc_result. 
(It's good programming practice anyway)

for (...) {
  $temp = odbc_result($result,$i);
  if($temp){
    ...
    echo $temp;
    ...
  }
}

Hopefully useful note on accessing TEXT fields on Windows, using PHP's ODBC
support to access Sybase*. With the following code:

"SELECT status AS projstatus,oid AS projident,LOWER(title) AS
projtitel,startsOn AS projanfang,terminatesOn AS projende,description AS
projinfo FROM Project ORDER BY projtitel ASC"

I was getting a strange error:

  Warning: SQL error: [INTERSOLV][ODBC SQL Server driver][SQL Server]Invalid
column name 'projanfang'. , SQL state S0022 in SQLGetData in [**scriptname and
path removed**] on line 126

even though I was clearly selecting a field as 'projanfang'. The reason I
worked out eventually is that Sybase/ODBC attempts to do a conversion on the
TEXT field 'description', which fails since the limit for CONVERT is 255
characters, and TEXT is a field type with a  2 GB limit. I am not sure why it
doesn't work implicitly, but it does explicitly. The following code will work
without errors:

  "SELECT status AS projstatus,oid AS projident,LOWER(title) AS
projtitel,startsOn AS projanfang,terminatesOn AS projende,CONVERT(CHAR
(255),description) AS projinfo FROM Project ORDER BY projtitel ASC"

What you do if you have a need for more than 255 characters of your text field,
I do not know :(. I have also tried longreadlen, but I couldn't work out how it
could be used.

FWIW, ADO and similar ODBC-using interfaces also cannot distinguish between
A.id and B.id. The easy solution is aliasing in SQL:

Consider a table "A" consisting only of the column "id". Next, consider the
following query:

SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON A.id=B.id

With ODBC, you'd be forced to use the numerical index, rather than the name.
However, you could rewrite the query, too:

SELECT A.id AS A_id, B.id AS B_id FROM A JOIN B ON A.id=B.id

This can be better on three counts:

Firstly, unless you really want everything in the result set, it might be
faster. SQL servers can be faster with "*", but often the networking will
benefit from less data (Or a smaller tuple width, if you're into database
jargon).

Secondly, since you're forced into thinking about what you want out of the
query, you'll probably write better SQL as a result.

Thirdly, if you change the query - or tables - slightly, you don't have to
revisit all your code to cope with the change.

Aplogies for stating the obvious, and having no imagination with my examples.
===============================================================================

Here's a limitation that isn't mentioned anywhere (that I could see) and gave
me a rather large headache for a couple of hours trying to figure out why my
database wasn't initializing correctly.
If you are trying to retrieve a large collection of fields from a database, be
aware that odbc_result may only return up to 33 result columns.  Any more than
that, and it generates a "result out of range" warning in your script.
(I tried adjusting to have 32 fields, with the same bug.) It generates an error
"Warning: Field index is larger than the number of fields inyour-script.php on
line 70" ANY time you try to retrieve the last field of a sufficiently large
record. What worked for me was just to write the last column twice... that way,
the query has 34 fields, but the last two are the same. You know it'll crash if
you ask for #34, but just use ODBC_result(current_query, 33) and you won't have
a problem. Good luck

If I use and MS Access 2000 database with fields of type memo, I get:
"Warning: SQL error: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Invalid cursor state, SQL
state 24000 in SQLGetData in D:\Inetpub\wwwroot\xxx\xxx.php on line XxX." If I
change to type "text," everything's cool.
===============================================================================

Beware if you have fields with the same name in a result

<?php
$res = odbc_exec($conn,"select * from PeopleMR,People,Role,Organisation".
" WHERE PeopleMR.MeetingID = $MeetingID" .
" ORDER BY People.Surname");
?>

I have the field "Name" from both TABLE Role and TABLE Organisation, as for
MySQL you would do :

<?php
mysql_result($res,$count,"Role.Name");  
mysql_result($res,$count,"Organisation.Name");
?>

but with odbc you do :

<?php odbc_result($res,$count,"Name"); ?>

this gives you the result of TABLE Role "Name" so you have to find the Field
Number for the Organisation"Name" to have the correct result.

FYI: odbc_result contains the following values: TABLE_QUALIFIER    TABLE_OWNER 
  TABLE_NAME    COLUMN_NAME    DATA_TYPE    TYPE_NAME    PRECISION    LENGTH   
SCALE    RADIX    NULLABLE    REMARKS    COLUMN_FLAGS

I wrote the following to dump these values onto the page. I needed this to
determine if the data-type for a column was something specific (eg: blob) to
show a different result, instead of the actual contents.

        $connection_string = 'OPTIM_BLOB';
        $user = '';
        $pass = '';       
        if (!($connect = odbc_pconnect($connection_string, $user, $pass))) {
           
        } else {
            echo 'Connecting to DSN, loading tables<br /><br />';
            $result = odbc_tables($myconn);
            $tables = array();
            while (odbc_fetch_row($result)){
                if(odbc_result($result,"TABLE_TYPE")=="TABLE") {
                    $TableName = odbc_result($result,"TABLE_NAME");
                    echo '<span id="tableName">Table: '.$TableName.'</span>
....<br /><br /> ';
                    //--------- Show Columns in that table ---------------
                    $result2 = odbc_columns($myconn, '', "%", $TableName, "%");
  //db connection, DB name, schema, table name, column_name);

                    while(odbc_fetch_row($result2)){
                        //TABLE_QUALIFIER    TABLE_OWNER    TABLE_NAME

                        $COLUMN_NAME = odbc_result($result2, 4); // COLUMN_NAME
                        $DataType = odbc_result($result2, 6);
                        echo '<b>Column name: '.$COLUMN_NAME.'</b> Type:

I use one store procedure to retrieve value of identifier, other, name,
section,data and datecreated coulmns to variable from SQL server table

using $odbc_result = odbc_exec($connect,$query); function.

After that, I using following code,
for($f=1;$f<=odbc_num_fields($odbc_result);$f++) {echo "<td style=\
"font-weight:bold\">$f ".odbc_field_name($odbc_result,$f)."</td>";}
echo "</tr></table>";
odbc_fetch_row($odbc_result);
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,1)."<br>";
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,2)."<br>";
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,3)."<br>";
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,4)."<br>";
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,5)."<br>";
echo odbc_result($odbc_result,6)."<br>";

The result is as following,
1 identifier 2 other 3 name 4 section 5 data 6 datecreated
id1
other2

I can not get "data"(Text column) back. Firstly, I think "data" column is too
long for odbc_result($odbc_result,5) function, but after I check my old colde,
I found I can get the "data" back using same function odbc_result().

I would like to hear any suggestions from you. Depressed on this question.

Imagick::count — Description

说明

public void Imagick::count ([ string $mode ] )

Returns the number of images.

参数

mode

    An unused argument. Currently there is a non-particularly well defined
    feature in PHP where calling count() on a countable object might (or might
    not) require this method to accept a parameter. This parameter is here to
    be conformant with the interface of countable, even though the param is not
    used.

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoClient::killCursor — Kills a specific cursor on the server

This extension that defines this method is deprecated. Instead, the MongoDB
extension should be used. There is no equivalent for this method in the new
extension.

说明

public bool MongoClient::killCursor ( string $server_hash , int|MongoInt64 $id
)

In certain situations it might be needed to kill a cursor on the server.
Usually cursors time out after 10 minutes of inactivity, but it is possible to
create an immortal cursor with MongoCursor::immortal() that never times out. In
order to be able to kill such an immortal cursor, you can call this method with
the information supplied by MongoCursor::info().

参数

server_hash

    The server hash that has the cursor. This can be obtained through 
    MongoCursor::info().

id

    The ID of the cursor to kill. You can either supply an int containing the
    64 bit cursor ID, or an object of the MongoInt64 class. The latter is
    necessary on 32 bit platforms (and Windows).

返回值

Returns TRUE if the method attempted to kill a cursor, and FALSE if there was
something wrong with the arguments (such as a wrong server_hash). The return
status does not reflect where the cursor was actually killed as the server does
not provide that information.

错误／异常

This method displays a warning if the supplied server_hash does not match up
with an existing connection. No attempt to kill a cursor is attempted in that
case either.

范例

Example #1 MongoClient::killCursor() example

This example shows how to connect, do a query, obtain the cursor information
and then kill the cursor.

<?php
$m = new MongoClient();
$c = $m->testdb->collection;
$cursor = $c->find();
$result = $cursor->next();

// Now the cursor is valid, so we can get the hash and ID out:
$info = $cursor->info();

// Kill the cursor
MongoClient::killCursor( $info['server'], $info['id'] );
?>

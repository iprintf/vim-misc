socket_select

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

socket_select — Runs the select() system call on the given arrays of sockets
with a specified timeout

说明

int socket_select ( array &$read , array &$write , array &$except , int $tv_sec
[, int $tv_usec = 0 ] )

socket_select() accepts arrays of sockets and waits for them to change status.
Those coming with BSD sockets background will recognize that those socket
resource arrays are in fact the so-called file descriptor sets. Three
independent arrays of socket resources are watched.

参数

read

    The sockets listed in the read array will be watched to see if characters
    become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read will not
    block - in particular, a socket resource is also ready on end-of-file, in
    which case a socket_read() will return a zero length string).

write

    The sockets listed in the write array will be watched to see if a write
    will not block.

except

    The sockets listed in the except array will be watched for exceptions.

tv_sec

    The tv_sec and tv_usec together form the timeout parameter. The timeout is
    an upper bound on the amount of time elapsed before socket_select() return.
    tv_sec may be zero , causing socket_select() to return immediately. This is
    useful for polling. If tv_sec is NULL (no timeout), socket_select() can
    block indefinitely.

tv_usec

Warning

On exit, the arrays are modified to indicate which socket resource actually
changed status.

You do not need to pass every array to socket_select(). You can leave it out
and use an empty array or NULL instead. Also do not forget that those arrays
are passed by reference and will be modified after socket_select() returns.

    Note:

    Due a limitation in the current Zend Engine it is not possible to pass a
    constant modifier like NULL directly as a parameter to a function which
    expects this parameter to be passed by reference. Instead use a temporary
    variable or an expression with the leftmost member being a temporary
    variable:
   
    Example #1 Using NULL with socket_select()

    <?php
    $e = NULL;
    socket_select($r, $w, $e, 0);
    ?>

返回值

On success socket_select() returns the number of socket resources contained in
the modified arrays, which may be zero if the timeout expires before anything
interesting happens. On error FALSE is returned. The error code can be
retrieved with socket_last_error().

    Note:

    Be sure to use the === operator when checking for an error. Since the 
    socket_select() may return 0 the comparison with == would evaluate to TRUE:
   
    Example #2 Understanding socket_select()'s result

    <?php
    $e = NULL;
    if (false === socket_select($r, $w, $e, 0)) {
        echo "socket_select() failed, reason: " .
            socket_strerror(socket_last_error()) . "\n";
    }
    ?>

范例

Example #3 socket_select() example

<?php
/* Prepare the read array */
$read   = array($socket1, $socket2);
$write  = NULL;
$except = NULL;
$num_changed_sockets = socket_select($read, $write, $except, 0);

if ($num_changed_sockets === false) {
    /* Error handling */
} else if ($num_changed_sockets > 0) {
    /* At least at one of the sockets something interesting happened */
}
?>

注释

    Note:

    Be aware that some socket implementations need to be handled very
    carefully. A few basic rules:
      □ You should always try to use socket_select() without timeout. Your
        program should have nothing to do if there is no data available. Code
        that depends on timeouts is not usually portable and difficult to
        debug.
      □ No socket resource must be added to any set if you do not intend to
        check its result after the socket_select() call, and respond
        appropriately. After socket_select() returns, all socket resources in
        all arrays must be checked. Any socket resource that is available for
        writing must be written to, and any socket resource available for
        reading must be read from.
      □ If you read/write to a socket returns in the arrays be aware that they
        do not necessarily read/write the full amount of data you have
        requested. Be prepared to even only be able to read/write a single
        byte.
      □ It's common to most socket implementations that the only exception
        caught with the except array is out-of-bound data received on a socket.

A simple PHP script using socket_select() to manage multiple connections.
connect using "telnet localhost 9050". it broadcasts your messages that you
send through telnet to other users connected to the server -- sort of like a
chat script

<?php

    $port = 9050;
   
    // create a streaming socket, of type TCP/IP
    $sock = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP);

resposibility to send/recv data, disconnect, etc..

===============================================================================

as of 12/2015 and php 5.3.3, the socket_select() maximum sockets is still 1024
and not risable by process file limits (bash ulimit -n). PHP new compilation is
required to raise the limits. Or one might rather choose forking or multiple
binaries.
===============================================================================

The way the document describes socket_select()'s handling of sockets polled for
read is rather obscure.

It says that it checks to see if reading would not "block," but the overall
description of socket_select() says it checks for a change in blocking status.
Unfortunately, these are in conflict.

If a socket already has data in the buffer, calling socket_select() on that
socket would never return (assuming null timeout), and would block forever. :-(
This is because the blocking status wouldn't change. It simply stays
"non-blocking"

It is important to remember NOT to select() on a socket which may already have
data available.

An example...
<?php
//... $socket is already here...
$done = false;
$n = 0;
do{
    $tmp = 0;
    $r = $w = $e = array();
    $r = array($socket);
    socket_select($r,$w,$e,null);
    $n = socket_recv($socket, $tmp, 1024, 0);

    //$done = true; //Something determines that we are done reading...
}while(!$done);
?>
This MAY NOT work... socket_select() is always being called... but we may have
data in the input buffer.

We need to ensure that the last time we read, nothing was read... (empty
buffer)
<?php
//... $socket is already here...
$done = false;
$n = 0;
do{
    $tmp = 0;
    $r = $w = $e = array();
    $r = array($socket);
    if($n === 0) socket_select($r,$w,$e,null);
    $n = socket_recv($socket, $tmp, 1024, 0);

    //$done = true; //Something determines that we are done reading...
}while(!$done);
?>
===============================================================================

Probably you will want to use

// get a list of all the clients that have data to be read from
// if there are no clients with data, go to next iteration
        if (socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, NULL) < 1)
            continue;
           
instead 
        if (socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, 0) < 1)
            continue;
which will hang your CPU to 100% (return immediate if nothing to be done)
===============================================================================

As it was already said, some clients need \0 character to end transmission, for
example Flash's XMLSocket.

You should also be prepared to read less data than you have requested.

Here is an example of a socket buffer - it's an array which has socket
resources for keys and an array of a timestamp and recieved data as values.

I find that the best practice for sending data is trailing it with a new line
and zero character (\n\0), because you will probably have different types of
clients which behave differently for reading data from sockets. Some need a \n
to fire an event, some need \0.

For recieving data, sometimes you will get splitted data - this can hapen
because the buffer is full (in my example 8192 bytes) or it just gets broken
during transmission in lower levels.

Sometimes you can read two messages at once, but they have a zero character in
between, so you can just use preg_split() to split the messages. The second
message may not be complete, so you add it to your buffer.

<?php
    const message_delimiter = "\n\0";

    /*
     * Clear socket buffers older than 1 hour
     */
    function clear_buffer() {
        foreach($this->buffer as $key=>$val) {
            if(time() - $val['ts'] > 3600) {
                unset($this->buffer[$key]);
            }
        }
    }

        }

        $this->buffer[$sock]['data'] .= $data;
        $this->buffer[$sock]['ts'] = time();
    }

    function buffer_get($sock) {
        // split buffer by the end of string
        $lines = preg_split('/\0/',$this->buffer[$sock]['data']);

        // reset buffer to the last line of input
        // if the buffer was sent completely, the last line of input should be
        // an empty string
        $this->buffer[$sock]['data'] = trim($lines[count($lines)-1]);

        if(!empty($this->buffer[$sock]['data'])) {
            debug("buffer is not empty for $sock, len: ".strlen($this->buffer[
$sock]['data']));
        }

        // remove the last line of input (incomplete data)
        // parse any complete data

If you using a Flash client - you should know some specific features:

1) when client connects to the server - it is sending to you "
<policy-file-request/>"."\0" string. Server should answer an XML policy file,
then disconnect from this client. Code is something like

if ('<policy-file-request/>'==substr($data, 0, 22))
                {
                    echo "policy requset.\n";
                    flush();ob_flush();
                    $msg = '<'.'?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/
cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
<allow-access-from domain="*" to-ports="*" />
</cross-domain-policy>'."\0";
                    echo "Say to client (crossdomain.xml) ... ";
                    flush();ob_flush();
                    socket_write($read_sock, $msg, strlen($msg));
                    echo "OK\n";
                    flush();ob_flush();
                   
                    echo "Closing ... ";
                    flush();ob_flush();
                    socket_close($read_sock);
                    echo "OK\n";
                    flush();ob_flush();
                }
                else
                {
// here is normal IO operations with client
}

2) every output to client should be ended with "\0" (if using XMLSocket in
Flash client) - otherwise flash will not generate onData event

In regards to the code posted by vardhan ( at ) rogers ( dot ) com, it appears
that on the following line:
        if (socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, 0) < 1)
the timeout parameter is accidentally set to 0, rather than NULL. This means
that the select call will return immediately rather than blocking indefinitely.

Change the socket_select line to the following for great success:
        if (socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, NULL) < 1)

Another solution to the problem of keys not being preserved is to have an
additional array for looking up sockets that uses their resource identifiers as
keys. This can be obtained using array_flip() in some cases, but is
particularly useful if each socket is associated with an object. In this case,
you can make the object's constructor add a pointer to itself to the lookup
array with its socket resource identifier as a key and use the following code
to execute a read method for the object associated with each socket returned by
socket_select():

<?php
socket_select($reads, $writes, $excepts, 0);

foreach ($sockets as $socket) {
    $lookuparray[$socket]->read();
}
?>
===============================================================================

Just noticed that you have to loop socket_select () when using UDP to get all
queued packets:

<?php
while (socket_select ($aRead, $aWrite, $aExcept, 1) > 0) {
    foreach ($aReadUdp as $oSocket) {
        $this->clientReadUdp ($oSocket);
    }

That's important because every call of socket_select () on UDP brings you only
one result. But there could be 10.000 results queued and if your turnarround
time is to slow (server busy, other sleeps etc.), you'll never progress all
results in near realtime.
===============================================================================

Just to add to this.  Since the information contained in the notes is somewhat
old.   It appears keys are being preserved now.

So, if you rely on knowing which keys need to be worked with and were like me
and thought that it didnot preserve.  Well it does.
===============================================================================

If you want to use a simple fractional value for timeout:

<?php
socket_select(..., floor($timeout), ceil($timeout*1000000));
?>
===============================================================================

Regarding the comment below, No, it does not, it's a system call and I believe
it's rather hard to preserve keys.

Additionally, socket_select should be used like it was a user-inputted array,
that you don't know what you sent in to.

<?php
$reads = $clients;
$reads[] = $server;

socket_select($reads);

foreach ($reads as $read) {
    /* do some stuff */
}
?>
===============================================================================

Note that the resulting arrays do NOT maintain keys (PHP 4.3.2) after being run
through this function:

Before:
Array
(
    [Client_Socket] => Resource id #6
    [Server_Socket] => Resource id #9
)

After:
Array
(
    [0] => Resource id #6
    [1] => Resource id #9
)

It would have been nice to have the keys stay to figure out which stream you
need to receive from, but you'll have to use some fancy foreach loop to figure
out which sockets to check.

It is probably a bad idea to watch an array of sockets for input with
socket_select, and then socket_read() using PHP_NORMAL_READ.

Although this seems desirable, you can end up with a permanently blocked
program, if someone sends you malformed input which is missing a trailing \n \
r. Guess how I found that out.
===============================================================================

Please note that the timeout parameter has important side-effects on the CPU
usage of your script.

Setting the timeout to 0 will make your CPU looping without any time to have
some rest and handle other running processes on your system, causing the system
load to increase heavily while your script is running.

Personnaly, I use a value of 15 ms for this parameter. this ensures a good
listening frequency while letting your system load clear.

Example :
$read = array($ListeningSocket);
$num_changed_sockets = socket_select($read, $write = NULL, $except = NULL, 0,
10);

Hope this helps.

hello,
i just made a class which acts similiar to Perl's IO::Select in order to make
socket selecting very easy

your script should look something like that:

<?php
$server = new Server;
$client = new Client;

for (;;) {
  foreach ($select->can_read(0) as $socket) {

    if ($socket == $client->socket) {
      // New Client Socket
      $select->add(socket_accept($client->socket));
    }
    else {
      //there's something to read on $socket
    }
  }
}
?>

you should of course implement some routines to detect broken sockets and
remove them from the select object.

you can also do output buffering and check in the main-loop for sockets that
are ready to write

<?php
class select {
  var $sockets;

  function select($sockets) {

    $this->sockets = array();

    foreach ($sockets as $socket) {
      $this->add($socket);
    }
  }

  function add($add_socket) {
    array_push($this->sockets,$add_socket);
  }

  function remove($remove_socket) {
    $sockets = array();

    foreach ($this->sockets as $socket) {
      if($remove_socket != $socket)
        $sockets[] = $socket;
    }

    $this->sockets = $sockets;
  }

  function can_read($timeout) {
    $read = $this->sockets;
    socket_select($read,$write = NULL,$except = NULL,$timeout);
    return $read;
  }

  function can_write($timeout) {
    $write = $this->sockets;
    socket_select($read = NULL,$write,$except = NULL,$timeout);
    return $write;
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you haven't done any network programming before, PHP's socket_select() might
appear a bit strange to you. I've written a simple php "partyline" script to
demonstrate the multi-socket use of select'ing at http://dave.dapond.com/
socketselect.php.txt
===============================================================================

socket_select() can also serve as a more granular sleep():

<?php
  # half-second sleep
  $undef = array();
  socket_select($undef, $undef, $undef, 0, "500000");
?>

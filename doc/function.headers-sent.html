headers_sent

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

headers_sent — Checks if or where headers have been sent

说明

bool headers_sent ([ string &$file [, int &$line ]] )

Checks if or where headers have been sent.

You can't add any more header lines using the header() function once the header
block has already been sent. Using this function you can at least prevent
getting HTTP header related error messages. Another option is to use Output
Buffering.

参数

file

    If the optional file and line parameters are set, headers_sent() will put
    the PHP source file name and line number where output started in the file
    and line variables.

line

    The line number where the output started.

返回值

headers_sent() will return FALSE if no HTTP headers have already been sent or
TRUE otherwise.

范例

Example #1 Examples using headers_sent()

<?php

// If no headers are sent, send one
if (!headers_sent()) {
    header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
    exit;
}

// An example using the optional file and line parameters, as of PHP 4.3.0
// Note that $filename and $linenum are passed in for later use.
// Do not assign them values beforehand.
if (!headers_sent($filename, $linenum)) {
    header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
    exit;

// You would most likely trigger an error here.
} else {

    echo "Headers already sent in $filename on line $linenum\n" .
          "Cannot redirect, for now please click this <a " .
          "href=\"http://www.example.com\">link</a> instead\n";
    exit;
}

?>

I was having trouble getting my mind around the concepts involved. Here is my
dilemma and the conclusion I reached in case recounting them can help others:

I am using WAMPserver: PHP 5.2.6, and Apache 2.2.8 on Windows XP SP3. If it
matters to your duplication,
I found two php.ini files in WAMPserver where output_buffering had been set to
4096. I changed them to OFF for this testing.

Here is how you can replicate what I am experiencing: With IE 7.0 go to Tools
... Display ieHTTPheaders ... and run the following script repeatedly and watch
what happens:

<?php
header( 'Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1998 05:00:00 GMT' );
//var_dump(headers_sent());
//print("whatever");
//flush();
//echo "whatever";
var_dump(headers_sent());
?>

Result: the final var_dump of the headers_sent() function will
always return FALSE unless any one or  more of the commented lines above it are
uncommented. Uncommenting the statements allows an output to be sent to the
user not just to their browser, after which the final var_dump will return
TRUE. What I found confusing was that the ieHTTPheaders tool shows that the
header is being sent to the user's browser even when all the output lines are
commented out. So why does headers_sent() return FALSE in this case? Because
you can keep sending other headers. The headers_sent function is meant to alert
one to when no further headers can be sent. My testing shows it does not return
true unless some other output is also sent after the header, thereby signaling
that  "Headers have been sent and concluded with user output. NOW you can't
send any more headers."

Someone else worked his way through this problem in a (false) bug report: http:
//bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30264
Here is the relevant part of the reply from the pro:
"When you use compression the entire page is buffered in memory, until end of
the request. Consequently you can send headers at any time because no data is
being actually sent to user when you print it. Until PHP actually decides to
send any page output to the user you can still send additional headers which is
why the headers_sent() function is returning false. It will return true,
indicating that headers have been sent  only at a time when output began going
to the user and you no longer can send any additional headers."

So in summary, my point is that there is a difference between headers being
sent only to the browser (which can be followed by other headers) vs. headers
being sent and concluded by output for the user. The function should have been
given a more clear name like headers_concluded().
===============================================================================

Note that in IIS (or at least the version that comes with W2K server), the
server seems to do some buffering, so even if you output someting or cause a
warning, the value of headers_sent() may be false because the headers haven't
been sent yet.

So it's not a safe way to know if warnings have been encountered in your
script.
===============================================================================

In response to K.Tomono and alexrussell101 at gmail dot com :

Yes,
headers_sent() will return false, even if you sent something to the ouptut
using print() or header() , if output_buffering is different from Off in you
php.ini, and the length of what you sent does not exceed the size of
output_buffering.

To test it, try this code with  these values in php.ini
1) output_buffering=32
2) output buffering = 4096

[code]
<?php
    echo "Yo<br />";
    echo "Sent:",headers_sent(),"<br />";
    echo "enough text to feed the buffer until it overflows ;-)<br />";
    echo "Sent:",headers_sent(),"<br />";
?>
[/code]

then put
3) output buffering = Off
and try this code
[code]
<?php
    echo "Yo<br />";
    echo "Sent:",headers_sent(),"<br />";
?>
[/code]
which will this time unconditionnally say that headers were sent.

This is noticed in php.ini comment :
"Output buffering allows you to send header lines (including cookies) even
after you send body content, in the price of slowing PHP's output layer a bit."

Note : This is completly independant of implicit_flush tuning.
===============================================================================

Here a function to check also if any other outout is already sent:
<?php

function output_send(){
    if (!headers_sent() && error_get_last()==NULL ) {
        return false;

    }
    return true;
}
?>
===============================================================================

This is becoming annoying the amount of posts to try and describe the behaviour
of headers

Headers appear first in the data sent to the user's browser

if headers have been called using the header() function but no data has been
sent to the output buffer (using echo, readfile etc), then the headers are sent
at the end of script execution otherwise they are sent when the buffer reaches
it's limit and emptied

simple

this means that headers_sent() will return false if nothing is sent to the
output buffer because the headers are being sent at the end of the script

This is not a bug either, this is expected behaviour. Keeping headers until
forced to send them out is a good idea because certain measures can be taken
like prevention of meta injection etc (option in header() to replace headers
that have not yet been sent)

besides, headers_sent() is good for when you try and send headers but the
output buffer has already been emptied (in cases of php error handling for
example). Obviously if the buffer has emtpied, sending headers won't work.

very handy function!

When working with GD I made something like:

<?php
class image{

    /**
     * show
     * sends image to browser and destroy the resource if headers not sent.
     * use php constants IMAGETYPE_GIF, IMAGETYPE_JPEG, IMAGETYPE_PNG
     *
     * @final
     * @static
     * @access public
     * @param resource $resource
     * @param int $type
     */
    final static public function show($resource, $type){
        if(!headers_sent()){
            header('Cache-control: private');
            switch($type){
                case IMAGETYPE_GIF :    header('Content-type: image/gif');
                                        header('Content-Disposition: filename='
.basename(__FILE__).'.gif');
                                        imagegif($resource);
                                        break;
                case IMAGETYPE_JPEG :     header('Content-type: image/jpeg');
                                        header('Content-Disposition: filename='
.basename(__FILE__).'.jpg');
                                        imagejpeg($resource, NULL, 99);
                        break;
                case IMAGETYPE_PNG :     header('Content-type: image/png');
                                        header('Content-Disposition: filename='
.basename(__FILE__).'.png');
                                        imagepng($resource, NULL, 0,  NULL);
                        break;
            }
            imagedestroy($resource);
            exit;
        }
    }
}
?>

This way if you are debugging... and flush output... you will not get the
endless list of headers allready send errors...

Hope it's helpfull... ;)
===============================================================================

In my case, when I install PHP 5.2.1 in CGI mode under Apache 2.2.3 (on windows
2003 SP2),
function sent_headers() always return false. flash(), ob_end_flash(), so on...
no matter.
I suppose, Apache buffering all PHP output until exit()
===============================================================================

For programmers used to Perl, note that sending a relative 'Location:' header
sends a redirect to the browser in PHP, unlike Perl which will attempt to call
relative URLs using an internal subrequest and return that page to the browser
without redirecting.  If you want to do the same trick in PHP, use include() or
virtual().

RE: antti at haapakangas dot net's post

I've changed the code so $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] is used if $_SERVER
['HTTP_HOST'] is not set.  $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] doesn't meet my needs, but I
suppose it's good to fall back on it.  I've also fixed a problem in the meta
refresh line - it was missing the "url=" part of the content attribute.

<?php
function server_url()
{  
    $proto = "http" .
        ((isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] == "on") ? "s" : "") . 
"://";
    $server = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) ?
        $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] : $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
    return $proto . $server;
}
   
function redirect_rel($relative_url)
{
    $url = server_url() . dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) . "/" . $relative_url;
    if (!headers_sent())
    {
        header("Location: $url");
    }
    else
    {
        echo "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=$url\">\r\n";
    }
}
?>

Re: php at fufachew dot com

That's a nice example how to implement Location header in a correct way (using
absoluteURI). 95% of the scripts I have seen just use relativeURI which is
wrong. Some browsers, for example lynx, actually notify user about incomplete
Location headers. However it might be safer to use $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']
instead of $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']. Host header is a HTTP/1.1 feature and you can
not count on that if you want to be interoperable with HTTP/1.0
implementations.

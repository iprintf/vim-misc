apc_load_constants — Loads a set of constants from the cache

说明

bool apc_load_constants ( string $key [, bool $case_sensitive = true ] )

Loads a set of constants from the cache.

参数

key

    The name of the constant set (that was stored with apc_define_constants())
    to be retrieved.

case_sensitive

    The default behaviour for constants is to be declared case-sensitive; i.e.
    CONSTANT and Constant represent different values. If this parameter
    evaluates to FALSE the constants will be declared as case-insensitive
    symbols.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 apc_load_constants() example

<?php
$constants = array(
    'ONE'   => 1,
    'TWO'   => 2,
    'THREE' => 3,
);
apc_define_constants('numbers', $constants);
apc_load_constants('numbers');
echo ONE, TWO, THREE;
?>

以上例程会输出：

===============================================================================

There doesn't seem to be a way to store constants that have already been
defined. This function, apc_define_constants(), does both things: (1) defines a
constant, and (2) stores the constant in the cache. This is unfortunate, since
it introduces the requirement to handle constant definitions differently when
APC is not available.

(If this function had a "$do_not_define" parameter, or the like, that would
give it more flexibility. I suppose filing a bug report would be a step in the
right direction to getting this idea considered.)

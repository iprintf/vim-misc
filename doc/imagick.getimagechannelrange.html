Imagick::getImageChannelRange — Gets channel range

说明

array Imagick::getImageChannelRange ( int $channel )

Gets the range for one or more image channels. 此方法在Imagick基于ImageMagick
6.4.0以上版本编译时可用。

参数

channel

    Provide any channel constant that is valid for your channel mode. To apply
    to more than one channel, combine channel constants using bitwise
    operators. 缺省为Imagick::CHANNEL_DEFAULT. 参考此通道常数列表

返回值

Returns an array containing minima and maxima values of the channel(s).

错误／异常

错误时抛出 ImagickException。

===============================================================================

The getImageChannelRange returns an array with two values mapped to the keys
'minima' and 'maxima', which are simply the minimum and maximum values of that
particular channel within the image that this function is performed upon.  For
photographs and high-quality imagery, that means that you're almost always
guaranteed to have the minima be at 0 and the maxima be at the maximum
bit-value allowed.  For most images, that's 65,535, which is the value of 2^16
(if you start counting at 0), meaning 16-bits per Channel imagery.  This goes
for all of the channels.

If an image is simple, though, you may be able to get a better variety of
ranges.  An image that was simply a red square, the maxima and minima values
for the Red Channel were both 65,535 (max), while the channels for the maxima
and minima values for all other channels was 0 (min).  If you want to know the
maximum values you might get back for any of the channels, feed this function
the default channel.

For your normal channels, you'll have something that looks like
"imagick::CHANNEL_RED", but you could have unusual channels like
"imagick::CHANNEL_OPACITY".  For colors, you have the "_VALUE" options of: red,
gray, cyan, green, magenta, blue, yellow, all, and default.  For unusual
channels, you have the "_VALUE" options of: undefined, alpha, opacity, matte,
black, and index.  With this function, the unusual channels always produce a
minima of 1.0E+37 (10^37) and a maxima of -1.0E-37 (-10^-37), which makes no
sense, so stick to the color values I pointed to above.

This function doesn't work for you?  No problem.  The function
getImageChannelExtrema does the same *EXACT* thing.  The only difference is
that the error you get on the unusual channels: their minima and maxima,
instead of defaulting to crazy values, simply defaults to 0.

In general, this function seems to have the utility of telling you how simple
an image might be -- if the difference between a channel maxima and minima is
very small, that means there wasn't much expression of color for that given
channel.  This will probably be able to tell you whether an image was drawn in
some simple paint program or if it's an actual photograph, but beyond that,
you'll have to do intensive programming to make it figure something out more
complicated.

And now, an example of the results for some red-only image:

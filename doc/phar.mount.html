Phar::mount

(PHP >= 5.3.0, PECL phar >= 2.0.0)

Phar::mount — Mount an external path or file to a virtual location within the
phar archive

说明

final public static void Phar::mount ( string $pharpath , string $externalpath
)

Much like the unix file system concept of mounting external devices to paths
within the directory tree, Phar::mount() allows referring to external files and
directories as if they were inside of an archive. This allows powerful
abstraction such as referring to external configuration files as if they were
inside the archive.

参数

pharpath

    The internal path within the phar archive to use as the mounted path
    location. This must be a relative path within the phar archive, and must
    not already exist.

externalpath

    A path or URL to an external file or directory to mount within the phar
    archive

返回值

No return. PharException is thrown on failure.

错误／异常

Throws PharException if any problems occur mounting the path.

范例

Example #1 A Phar::mount() example

The following example shows accessing an external configuration file as if it
were a path within a phar archive.

First, the code inside of a phar archive:

<?php
$configuration = simplexml_load_string(file_get_contents(
    Phar::running(false) . '/config.xml'));
?>

Next the external code used to mount the configuration file:

<?php
// first set up the association between the abstract config.xml
// and the actual one on disk
Phar::mount('phar://config.xml', '/home/example/config.xml');
// now run the application
include '/path/to/archive.phar';
?>

Another method is to put the mounting code inside the stub of the phar archive.
Here is an example of setting up a default configuration file if no user
configuration is specified:

<?php
// first set up the association between the abstract config.xml
// and the actual one on disk
if (defined('EXTERNAL_CONFIG')) {
    Phar::mount('config.xml', EXTERNAL_CONFIG);
    if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/extra_config.xml')) {
        Phar::mount('extra.xml', __DIR__ . '/extra_config.xml');
    }
} else {
    Phar::mount('config.xml', 'phar://' . __FILE__ . '/default_config.xml');
    Phar::mount('extra.xml', 'phar://' . __FILE__ . '/default_extra.xml');
}
// now run the application
include 'phar://' . __FILE__ . '/index.php';
__HALT_COMPILER();
?>

...and the code externally to load this phar archive:

<?php
define('EXTERNAL_CONFIG', '/home/example/config.xml');
// now run the application
include '/path/to/archive.phar';
?>

i tested phar to generate a one file drupal installation.
as every cms, drupal put all uploaded files in a seperate folder (i.e. /sites).

i think the mount options here expected a file, i didnt get it to work on
mounting a folder. is there any possibility to do that?

to generate a phar out of drupal7 with sqlite database

build.php
$phar = new Phar('drupal7.phar');
$phar->buildFromDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) . '/drupal-7.0-alpha5');
$phar->setStub("<?php
Phar::interceptFileFuncs();
Phar::mount('sites/default/settings.php', __DIR__ . '/sites/default/
settings.php');
Phar::mount('database.db', __DIR__ . '/database.db');
Phar::webPhar();
__HALT_COMPILER(); ?>"
);

to call the phar iam using a .htacces file:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/drupal.phar/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !build.php
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /drupal.phar/$1

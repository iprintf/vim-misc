Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

Get the list index for a modification made to an element of a many-valued
property. For example, if we modified the third element of a many-valued
property we could obtain an SDO_DAS_Setting from the change summary
corresponding to that modification. A call to getListIndex() on that setting
would return the value 2 (lists are indexed from zero).

参数

None.

返回值

The list index for the element of the many-valued property which has been
changed.

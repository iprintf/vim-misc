DOMDocument::save

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

DOMDocument::save — Dumps the internal XML tree back into a file

说明

public int DOMDocument::save ( string $filename [, int $options ] )

Creates an XML document from the DOM representation. This function is usually
called after building a new dom document from scratch as in the example below.

参数

filename

    The path to the saved XML document.

options

    Additional Options. Currently only LIBXML_NOEMPTYTAG is supported.

返回值

Returns the number of bytes written or FALSE if an error occurred.

更新日志

版本             说明
5.1.0 Added the options parameter

范例

Example #1 Saving a DOM tree into a file

<?php

$doc = new DOMDocument('1.0');
// we want a nice output
$doc->formatOutput = true;

$root = $doc->createElement('book');
$root = $doc->appendChild($root);

$title = $doc->createElement('title');
$title = $root->appendChild($title);

$text = $doc->createTextNode('This is the title');
$text = $title->appendChild($text);

echo 'Wrote: ' . $doc->save("/tmp/test.xml") . ' bytes'; // Wrote: 72 bytes

?>

The XML parser converts the text of an XML document into UTF-8, even if you
have set the character encoding of the XML, for example as a second parameter
of the DOMDocument constructor. After parsing the XML with the load() command
all its texts have been converted to UTF-8.

In case you append text nodes with special characters (e. g. Umlaut) to your
XML document you should therefore use utf8_encode() with your text to convert
it into UTF-8 before you append the text to the document. Otherwise you will
get an error message like "output conversion failed due to conv error" at the
save() command. See example below:

<?php
// Text to insert into XML below
$txt = "a text with special characters like 'ä', 'ß', 'Ü' etc.";

// Create Instance of DOMDocument
$dom =  new DOMDocument;
// Load XML file
// Was created before with DOMDocument('1.0', 'iso-8859-1')
$dom = $dom->load("file.xml");
// Find the parent node
$parent = $dom->documentElement;
// Create Instance of DomXPath
$xpath = new DomXPath($dom);
// new node will be inserted before this node
$next = $xpath->query("//parentnode/childnode");
// Create the new element
$new_elem = $dom->createElement('new_elem');
// Insert the new element
$parent->insertBefore($new_elem, $next->item(0));
// DOMXML = utf-8! (will be converted to iso-8859-1 only at 'save()')
// prevents error message "output conversion failed due to conv error" at 'save
()'
$txt = utf8_encode($txt);
// Create new text node with utf-8 encoded string
$nodetext = $dom->createTextNode("$txt");
// Append text node to new element
$nodetext = $new_elem->appendChild($nodetext);
// save
$dom->save("file.xml");
?>

Hope this helps someone.

It took me forever to discover that
DOMDocument->formatOutput = true
will only have an effect on documents that are loaded from disk if one also
sets
DOMDocument->preserveWhiteSpace = false ....

Hope this saves somebody a headache.

I had been hitting my head against the wall when I couldn't get an edited XML
file to save due to file permissions, even though I knew that it was OK.

Eventually I realised that for some odd reason, when I went to save the XML
file, it would try to write the file to the root directory.

As such, use realpath() to keep the complete system path to the XML file when
you load it:

<?php
$myfile = 'myxml.xml';
$myfile = realpath($myfile);
$doc = new DOMDocument('1.0');
$doc->load($myfile);

// Let's just add a couple of elements for good measure
$root = $doc->documentElement;

$title = $doc->createElement('title');
$title = $root->appendChild($title);

$text = $doc->createTextNode('This is a title');
$text = $title->appendChild($text);

$doc->save($myfile);
?>

I just intend to bring my little contribution to the use of DOMDocument::save()
function along with PHP serialize() function.

Sometimes you could have to serialize a PHP object before you put it into a XML
structure (or other..). And then I suppose you could have to save this XML
structure in a file. Of course, you will further need to read this file and
unserialize it before to use its content.

The problem appears when there are some properties described as Protected in
the object to be serialized.

As it’s written in the PHP documentation, serialize function add for those
protected properties an asterisk before the name of the property along with a
NULL character on each side of the asterisk.
In this case, the DOMDocument::save function will stop the save operation just
before the first NULL character met in the string to be saved, because PHP
consider it as a potential risk.
So, after that, the unserialize operation of the file become impossible.

To solve that, here is a first solution to apply :

For the serialize , before the DOMDocument::save() ::
$data_serial = explode("\x00\x2A\x00", serialize($object));  //take off the
'NULL * NULL' string
$data_serial = implode("\x5C\x30\x2A\x5C\x30", $data_serial);    //and replace
with '\0*\0' string

Before the unserialize :
$data_serial = explode("\x5C\x30\x2A\x5C\x30", $serialized_object);    // take
off the '\0*\0' string
$serial_object = implode("\x00\x2A\x00", $data_serial);      // and replace
with 'NULL * NULL' string as included by the previous serialize

And a second solution :

For the serialize, before the DOMDocument::save() :
$serialized_object = addslashes(serialize($object)) ;

Before re-using the object in your application :
$object = unserialize(stripslashes($serialized_object)) ;

Hope this will help some.

When creating a DOMDocument from scratch and saving it, the encoding will be
utf-8, although it's declared as iso-8859-1.

When loading an XML-file declared and saved as iso-8859-1, php will keep the
correct encoding when it's saved after changes are made.

Php converts files declared as iso-8859-1 to utf-8 internally. To add text
containing special characters, the text must be encoded as utf-8. When the
document is saved, special characters are converted to iso-8859-1.

To save an xml created from scratch, use fopen/fwrite and utf8_decode:
  
   $doc = new DOMDocument('1.0', 'iso-8859-1');

//Add som nodes and text with apropriate methods
  
   $f = fopen('xmlfile.xml', 'w+');
   fwrite($f, utf8_decode($doc->saveXML()));
   fclose($f);
===============================================================================

In addition to:
DOMDocument->formatOutput = true
DOMDocument->preserveWhiteSpace = false

...you also have to ensure you don't add text nodes as siblings of element
nodes, or formatOutput won't work.

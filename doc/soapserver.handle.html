Sometimes returned data can contain characters which are not valid in xml 1.0.
This causes the xml being output by SoapServer::handle to be invalid. Although
it's probably better to sanitize the data ealier, a combination of output
buffering and a simple regular expression can be used as a quick fix to make
sure the output is indeed valid xml.

For example:

<?php
    ob_start();
    $soapServer->handle();
    $soapXml = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    $soapXml = preg_replace ('/[^\x{0009}\x{000a}\x{000d}\x{0020}-\x{D7FF}\x
{E000}-\x{FFFD}]+/u', ' ', $soapXml);
    echo $soapXml;
?>

After much headache and looking through PHP source code, I finally found out
why the handle() function would immediately send back a fault with the string
"Bad Request".
Turns out that my client was sending valid XML, but the first line of the XML
was the actual XML declaration:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

When the "handle" function in the SoapServer class is called, it first tries to
parse the XML.  When the XML document can't be parsed, a "Bad Request" fault is
returned and execution of the script immediately stops.  I assume that the XML
parser built into PHP (libxml2) already assumes the document to be XML and when
it finds the declaration, it thinks it isn't valid.

I added some XML parsing calls to my service before the handle() function is
called to check for valid XML and avoid the "Bad Request" fault.  This also
allows me to send back a more suitable error message:

<?php
$parser = xml_parser_create("UTF-8");
if (!xml_parse($parser,$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA,true)){
   $webService->fault("500", "Cannot parse XML: ".
      xml_error_string(xml_get_error_code($parser)).
       " at line: ".xml_get_current_line_number($parser).
       ", column: ".xml_get_current_column_number($parser));
}
?>

Additional information to the comment of "Joeri Thissen" (http://www.php.net/
manual/en/soapserver.handle.php#113866)

In some cases the replacements generates a timeout (looks like it is in
combination with Nginx). The problem is that PHP has already sent a
content-length, and the webserver is still waiting for new content.

To fix this you have to reset the HTTP Content-Length with the right value:

<?php
ob_start();
$soapServer->handle();
$result = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

$result = str_replace("abcdef", "abc", $result);
$length = strlen($result);
       
header("Content-Length: ".$length);
echo $result;
===============================================================================

Please note that when defining several services in one wsdl file, and calling
one of those services, you may always get the response for your first service.

This is a known bug. You will find its description and some workarounds here  :

===============================================================================

Be aware that SoapServer::handle(); method sends additional HTTP headers to the
browser. One of them is "Content-Type: application/soap+xml". If you want to
execute SOAP methods locally as a part of SoapClient::__doRequest() (see
example at http://pl2.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.dorequest.php ) you may need
to reset (override) this header back to "Content-Type: text/html" like so:

<?php
function Add($x,$y) {
  return $x+$y;
}

class LocalSoapClient extends SoapClient {

  function __construct($wsdl, $options) {
    parent::__construct($wsdl, $options);
    $this->server = new SoapServer($wsdl, $options);
    $this->server->addFunction('Add');
  }

  function __doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version) {
    ob_start();
    $this->server->handle($request);
    $response = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    return $response;
  }

}

$x = new LocalSoapClient(NULL,array('location'=>'test://',
                                   'uri'=>'http://testuri.org'));

header("Content-Type: text/html");

var_dump($x->Add(3,4));

?>

In response to Blizzke:

Sometimes this problem can be hidden by an Apache segmentation fault along with
an HTTP headers error SoapFault thrown to the client.

If you get either of those 2, try checking to make sure that style="rpc" in
your WSDL file's soap:operation's.

-T
===============================================================================

Seems pretty logical once you find the solution, but it took me quite a while
to figure this one out:
If you are using WSDL based SOAP requests and you have more than one operation
in your binding (with the same parameters), make sure the <soap:operation>
style is set to rpc, NOT body!

When you specify 'body' here, all that will be transmitted in the request is
the parameters for the function call, and SoapServer->handle() will use the
first function it finds with the same parameter-makeup to handle the call.

ie If you have 2 functions:
<?php
function One ( string $blah );
function Two ( string $blah );
?>
Making a client call with SoapClient -> Two ( 'test' ); will result in One ( )
being called when your 'type' is set to 'body'

The actual method to call will only be included in the request when your type
is set to 'rpc', resulting in the expected behavior
===============================================================================

Sometime, it happens that PHP does not detect anything in $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA.

To solve this problem and make it work in any case:

function soaputils_autoFindSoapRequest()    {
    global $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA;
   
    if($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA)
        return $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA;
   
    $f = file("php://input");
    return implode(" ", $f);
}

$server = new SoapServer($wsdl);
$server->setClass($MyClass);

$server->handle(soaputils_autoFindSoapRequest());

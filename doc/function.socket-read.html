socket_read

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

socket_read — Reads a maximum of length bytes from a socket

说明

string socket_read ( resource $socket , int $length [, int $type =
PHP_BINARY_READ ] )

The function socket_read() reads from the socket resource socket created by the
socket_create() or socket_accept() functions.

参数

socket

    A valid socket resource created with socket_create() or socket_accept().

length

    The maximum number of bytes read is specified by the length parameter.
    Otherwise you can use \r, \n, or \0 to end reading (depending on the type
    parameter, see below).

type

    Optional type parameter is a named constant:
      □ PHP_BINARY_READ (Default) - use the system recv() function. Safe for
        reading binary data.
      □ PHP_NORMAL_READ - reading stops at \n or \r.

返回值

socket_read() returns the data as a string on success, or FALSE on error
(including if the remote host has closed the connection). The error code can be
retrieved with socket_last_error(). This code may be passed to socket_strerror
() to get a textual representation of the error.

    Note:

    socket_read() returns a zero length string ("") when there is no more data
    to read.

Another way to bypass the annoying thing with telnet, that send each character
as a string ,is to check if the response is "\r\n", that is the string that
telnet sends when the user presses enter.

Here is an example:
<?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);

/* Allow the script to hang around waiting for connections. */
set_time_limit(0);

/* Turn on implicit output flushing so we see what we're getting
* as it comes in. */
ob_implicit_flush();

$address = '127.0.0.1';
$port = 100;

if (($sock = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP)) === false) {
    echo "socket_create() failed: reason: " . socket_strerror(socket_last_error
()) . "\n";
}

if (socket_bind($sock, $address, $port) === false) {
    echo "socket_bind() failed: reason: " . socket_strerror(socket_last_error(
$sock)) . "\n";
}
else
  echo 'Socket ' . $address . ':' . $port . " has been opened\n";

if (socket_listen($sock, 5) === false) {
    echo "socket_listen() failed: reason: " . socket_strerror(socket_last_error
($sock)) . "\n";
}
else
   echo "Listening for new clients..\n";

   $client_id = 0;
do {
    if (($msgsock = socket_accept($sock)) === false) {
        echo "socket_accept() failed: reason: " . socket_strerror(
socket_last_error($sock)) . "\n";
        break;
    }
    else {
        $client_id += 1;
      echo "Client #" .$client_id .": Connect\n";
    }
     
    /* Send instructions. */
    $msg = "\nWelcome to the PHP Test Server. \n" .
        "To quit, type 'quit'. To shut down the server type 'shutdown'.\n";
    socket_write($msgsock, $msg, strlen($msg));
$cur_buf = '';
    do {
        if (false === ($buf = socket_read($msgsock, 2048))) {
            echo "socket_read() failed: reason: " . socket_strerror(
socket_last_error($msgsock)) . "\n";
            break 2;
        }
        if ($buf == "\r\n") {
        if ($cur_buf == 'quit') {
            echo 'Client #' .$client_id .': Disconnect' . "\n";
            break;
        }
        if ($cur_buf == 'shutdown') {
            socket_close($msgsock);
            break 2;
        }
        //else {
       $talkback = "Unknown command: " . str_replace("\r\n", '\r\n', $cur_buf)
."\n";
       socket_write($msgsock, $talkback, strlen($talkback));
       // }
        echo 'Client #' .$client_id .': ' . $cur_buf . "\n";
        $cur_buf = '';
        }
        else $cur_buf .= $buf;
    } while (true);
    socket_close($msgsock);
} while (true);

socket_close($sock);
?>

quote:
"Note:
socket_read() returns a zero length string ("") when there is no more data to
read."

This is not true!

In a while loop 
(example case few bytes to receive - just enough for 1 call, but you use a loop
to be sure you received all data)
if you use
<? socket_set_block($socket); ?>
you will get:
1st call in loop: data
2nd call in loop: a block forever, if there isnt data anymore or w/e happen to
the "other side"

So ofc you want to use
<? socket_set_nonblock($socket); ?>
and you will get:
1st call in loop: data
2nd call in loop: socket_read() returns FALSE (bool) and socket_last_error()
gives you a SOCKET_EWOULDBLOCK (http://de1.php.net/manual/de/
sockets.constants.php)

There is not a single time i got a empty string back from socket_read.
And im "working" on this problem(bug?) since a week or so.

You better use socket_recv() instead.
(good luck)
===============================================================================

if you'd like to make a "socket_read" on a linux-system connected with a
flash-client (v. 6.0 r81) you have to send a string to the connected port:

<?php

   ...  //initialising communication

    $string = "ready to get/send data\0";
    socket_write($socket, $string);

    //now you can read from...
    $line = trim(socket_read($socket, MAXLINE));

    ...  // do some stuff, finaly close connection
?>

PHP 5.2.0 / Win32 / Apache 1.3 - It seems like...

PHP_BINARY_READ - works, but returns '', not FALSE...
- is blocking, until data received or connection closed
- does pass-through \r\n etc.
- returns data on data, '' on connection closed
- you can detect closed connection by checking for '' (not FALSE as stated i
manual)

PHP_NORMAL_READ - not working so good...
- is non-blocking
- does not pass-through \r\n etc.
- returns false on no-data, false on connection closed :(
- (no way here to detect a closed connection...?)
- (is this a bug? http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=21880 )
- (is this a bug? http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=21197 )
- (could not get data from this option at all in fact...)

PHP_BINARY_READ seems to be the "right way to go"
for now. Both checking for '' and false to detect closed
connection is probably smart, as this "bug"(?) may
be fixed...
===============================================================================

PHP_NORMAL_READ - reading stops at \n or \r.

This seems to be meant literally.
If there is a \r, then it will stop reading, even if there is a \n right after
it. You have to call the read again just to get rid of the \n.
===============================================================================

Just a note that on my system the length seems to have an undocumented upper
bound of 65536. I was being lazy and not read()ing in a while loop until I
pointed it at real data ;)
===============================================================================

I don't know if is it stated anywhere with this clearance, but here is the
source code for detecting the connection abort/closure for sockets testing with
socket_read function:

<?php
$buf = @socket_read($routes[$i][$connectionid]['tunnelsrc'], $buffer_size);
if ($buf === '')
{
    $routes[$i][$connectionid]['disconnected']='Conenction abort at source
side';
}
?>

($buf === '') is the key :)

I was making an ecrypted tunnel script with mcrypt and was annoying that i
could not detect the connection abort from any side.
===============================================================================

On non-blocking connections it may not return full length requested.
===============================================================================

A way to wait for a message response by the socket or take the first message
incoming.

Note that if the server turn offline, you have a socket resource, but while
trying socket_read(), it gives you a warning message that will fill your hard
drive kickly due to logging.

The example above try read the message at best 3 times, 3 seconds sleeping for
another reading.
<?php
function waitResponse($response = "") {
   $status = "";
   $tries = 3;
   $counter = 0;
   while ($status == $response) {
            $status = socket_read($socket, 1024);
            if(!$status){
               if($counter >= $tries){
                  break;
               }else{
                  $counter++;
                  sleep(3);
               }
            }
   }
return $response;
}
===============================================================================

This paragraph is confusing:

socket_read() returns the data as a string on success, or FALSE on error
(including if the remote host has closed the connection). The error code can be
retrieved with socket_last_error(). This code may be passed to socket_strerror
() to get a textual representation of the error.
Note: socket_read() returns a zero length string ("") when there is no more
data to read.

My tests (on PHP 5.1.4) show that when you socket_read() on a shutdown-socket,
it returns FALSE when using PHP_NORMAL_READ, but returns "" when reading in
PHP_BINARY_READ.
===============================================================================

Windows telnet sends/recieves one character at a time. Try adding
PHP_NORMAL_READ to the end of socket_read, that might help.
===============================================================================

It seems like in socket_* functions in BLOCKING mode where is no way to check
if more than $length bytes are still available in socket (like
stream_get_meta_data()['unread_bytes']).
So you need to choose your prefered maximum $length (like 133693415:) or use
non-blocking mode (for realy big data reciving).
===============================================================================

if you want to use a non block socket you must to use socket_last_error

if(!socket_last_error($sc)){
   if($buffer=socket_read($sc,512,PHP_NORMAL_READ)){
      echo $buffer;
   }
}

if you use it your script wont take all your memory
===============================================================================

You may download a generic server class at http://www.php-tools.de
This class will accept the sockets read data from it and hands it to a callback
function. Furthermore there are methods for connection handling included.
===============================================================================

Messed up the end of my previous one. Corrected version here:

a simple work around to non-blocking working with normal read is like so:

$read = array($socket);
$write  = NULL;
$except = NULL;
while(1) {
    $num_changed_sockets = socket_select($read, $write, $except, 0, 1);
    if ( $num_changed_sockets > '0' ) {
        socket_read($socket,10000,PHP_NORMAL_READ);
    }
}
===============================================================================

PHP on win32 developers, please look at this bug report before using the
PHP_NORMAL_READ option:

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=21197

In a nutshell, using PHP_NORMAL_READ will make your calls to socket_read()
return an empty buffer every time.
===============================================================================

the proper way to detect a closed connection is to check socket_last_error.

Connection reset by peer is 104 (either use socket_strerror or don't suppress
errors for the time being to find these out), sooo.

while($buffer=@socket_read($sock,512,PHP_NORMAL_READ)){
    echo $buffer;
}
if(socket_last_error($sock) == 104) {
    echo "Connection closed";
}

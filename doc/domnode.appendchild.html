DOMNode::appendChild

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

DOMNode::appendChild — Adds new child at the end of the children

说明

public DOMNode DOMNode::appendChild ( DOMNode $newnode )

This function appends a child to an existing list of children or creates a new
list of children. The child can be created with e.g. DOMDocument::createElement
(), DOMDocument::createTextNode() etc. or simply by using any other node.

参数

newnode

    The appended child.

返回值

The node added.

错误／异常

DOM_NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

    Raised if this node is readonly or if the previous parent of the node being
    inserted is readonly.

DOM_HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR

    Raised if this node is of a type that does not allow children of the type
    of the newnode node, or if the node to append is one of this node's
    ancestors or this node itself.

DOM_WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

    Raised if newnode was created from a different document than the one that
    created this node.

范例

The following example will add a new element node to a fresh document.

Example #1 Adding a child

<?php

$doc = new DOMDocument;

$node = $doc->createElement("para");
$newnode = $doc->appendChild($node);

echo $doc->saveXML();
?>

===============================================================================

What's not mentioned here is that DOMNode::appendChild() can also be used to
move an existing node to another part of the DOMDocument, e.g.

<?php
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc->loadXML("<foobar><bar/><foo/></foobar>");
$bar = $doc->documentElement->firstChild;
$foo = $doc->documentElement->lastChild;
$foo->appendChild($bar);
print $doc->saveXML();
?>

This produces:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<foobar><foo><bar/></foo></foobar>

Note that the nodes "<foo/>" and "<bar/>" were siblings, i.e. the first and
last child of "<foobar>" but using appendChild() we were able to move "<bar/>"
so that it is a child of "<foo/>".

This saves you the trouble of doing a DOMNode::removeChild($bar) to remove "
<bar/>" before appending it as a child of "<foo/>".

===============================================================================

Aware dealing with DOMNodeList and appendChild() on the same Node.

If you want to replace only the children not the DOMElement itself you probably
foreach childNodes-property or get the DOMElements with a for-loop and item()
-method of the DOMNodeList.

You will fail if you not clone the received single DOMElement. Actually the
count of the DOMNodelist will be decreased on appendChild count but appendChild
seems to refer to the old Nodelist and nothing visible will happen. Cloning
will help.
===============================================================================

If you want to create nested DOM elements:

<?php
    $doc = new DOMDocument();
   
    $foo = $doc->createElement("foo");
    $doc->appendChild($foo);

    $bar = $doc->createElement("bar");
    $foo->appendChild($bar);

    $bazz = $doc->createElement("bazz");
    $foo->appendChild($bazz);

    echo $doc->saveXML();
?>

Is equivalent to:

<foo>
  <bar></bar>
  <bazz></bazz>
</foo>

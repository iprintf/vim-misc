ldap_sort — Sort LDAP result entries on the client side

说明

bool ldap_sort ( resource $link , resource $result , string $sortfilter )

Sort the result of a LDAP search, returned by ldap_search().

As this function sorts the returned values on the client side it is possible
that you might not get the expected results in case you reach the sizelimit
either of the server or defined within ldap_search().

Warning

This feature has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 7.0.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

参数

link

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by ldap_connect().

result

    An search result identifier, returned by ldap_search().

sortfilter

    The attribute to use as a key in the sort.

范例

Sorting the result of a search.

Example #1 LDAP sort

<?php
     // $ds is a valid link identifier (see ldap_connect)

     $dn        = 'ou=example,dc=org';
     $filter    = '(|(sn=Doe*)(givenname=John*))';
     $justthese = array('ou', 'sn', 'givenname', 'mail');

     $sr = ldap_search($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);

     // Sort
     ldap_sort($ds, $sr, 'sn');

     // Retrieving the data
     $info = ldap_get_entries($ds, $sr);

Here's a simple LDAP sort function I wrote:

<?php
function sort_ldap_entries($e, $fld, $order)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < $e['count']; $i++) {
        for ($j = $i; $j < $e['count']; $j++) {
            $d = strcasecmp($e[$i][$fld][0], $e[$j][$fld][0]);
            switch ($order) {
            case 'A':
                if ($d > 0)
                    swap($e, $i, $j);
                break;
            case 'D':
                if ($d < 0)
                    swap($e, $i, $j);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return ($e);
}

function swap(&$ary, $i, $j)
{
    $temp = $ary[$i];
    $ary[$i] = $ary[$j];
    $ary[$j] = $temp;
}
?>

so that it can be invoked like:

<?php
    $entries = sort_ldap_entries($entries, 'mail', 'A'); // sort entries by
ascending order of mail
?>

where,
    `$entries' is the array returned by ldap_get_entries() function.

This might be useful to those who still run older versions of PHP (<= 4.2.0) on
their web servers :-)
===============================================================================

This note may be self-evident, but the functionality of ldap_sort threw off
this sometime user of relational databases.

The following code will NOT do what you expect:

<?php

// omitted calls to connect and and bind to LDAP server...

// attributes we want to retrieve from LDAP server
$ldap_attributes = array ( 'cn', 'o', 'mail' ) ;

// retrieve attributes from matching entries
$search_results = ldap_search ( $ldap_conn, 'dc=example,dc=org', '(objectclass=
*)', 0, 500, 30 ) ;

// sort entries by last name ('sn')
ldap_sort ( $ldap_conn, $search_results, 'sn' ) ;

?>

The entries will NOT be sorted by last name. Why not? Because LDAP doesn't
function like a RDBMS; you cannot sort a result set on an arbitrary field,
regardless of whether you "selected" it. You must always include the attribute
by which you want to sort your entries among the requested attributes (add 'sn'
to $ldap_attributes, in this case).

Hope this is helpful to some other folks who scratched their heads when they
tried to sort entries and it didn't work out...
===============================================================================

This function applies strcmp() to each attribute (given by sortfilter) in order
to sort the entries returned by the server.  To order search results ascending
by last name, try passing "sn" as the sortfilter argument.  This function does
not play nice with multi-valued attributes.
===============================================================================

I wondered how to sort after a dn, for just show a tree view. I tried to set
$sortfilter = 'dn', but that didn't work. Than I tried with a blank string ''.
That worked, the entries are sorted by dn.
===============================================================================

If you are wanting to sort by multiple attributes, for instance ordering by
last name and then first name,  try this function. This is similar to "ORDER BY
lastname, firstname"  in SQL.

This function uses an insertion sort algorithm, which is somewhat faster then
the old-fashoned bubble sort.  The second argument is an array containing the
attributes you want to sort by. (this functon won't do descending or
ascending..  feel free to add it!)

<?php
/**
* @param array $entries
* @param array $attribs
* @desc Sort LDAP result entries by multiple attributes.
*/
function ldap_multi_sort(&$entries, $attribs){
    for ($i=1; $i<$entries['count']; $i++){
        $index = $entries[$i];
        $j=$i;
        do {
            //create comparison variables from attributes:
            $a = $b = null;
            foreach($attribs as $attrib){
                $a .= $entries[$j-1][$attrib][0];
                $b .= $index[$attrib][0];
            }
            // do the comparison
            if ($a > $b){
                $is_greater = true;
                $entries[$j] = $entries[$j-1];
                $j = $j-1;
            }else{
                $is_greater = false;
            }
        } while ($j>0 && $is_greater);
       
        $entries[$j] = $index;
    }
    return $entries;
}
?>

Something real simple i wrote to sort directory searches by a persons last
name.

<?php
for($i=0;$i<$result["count"];$i++)
{

$lastname = $result[$i]["sn"][0];

$lnames["$i"]=$lastname;

}//for i

@asort($lnames);
?>
===============================================================================

In order to order by multiple fields you can order your array many times:
For example:

        ldap_sort($link, $result, 'givenname');
        ldap_sort($link, $result, 'sn');

Example #1 DOMNode::getLineNo() example

<?php
// XML dump for below example
$xml = <<<XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<root>
    <node />
</root>
XML;

// Create a new DOMDocument instance
$dom = new DOMDocument;

// Load the XML
$dom->loadXML($xml);

// Print where the line where the 'node' element was defined in
printf('The <node> tag is defined on line %d', $dom->getElementsByTagName(
'node')->item(0)->getLineNo());
?>

以上例程会输出：

===============================================================================

The 65535 line number limit is no longer a problem when you use libxml 2.9 or
higher, but you have to explicitly enable support for big line numbers:

<?php
define('XML_PARSE_BIG_LINES', 4194304);
$dom = new DOMDocument;
$dom->loadXML($xml, XML_PARSE_BIG_LINES);
?>
===============================================================================

The DOMNode::getLineNo() method doesn't work properly due to a libxml2 bug.

===============================================================================

This function is buggy. It doesn't always return the correct line number,
especially for text elements. As an alternative you can do something like this:

<?php
$text = $node->ownerDocument->saveXML($node);
$line += substr_count($text, "\n");
?>

You'll want to keep a reference to $line (starting at 0) and add to it as you
parse over the document recursively.

In order for this to work you have to tell DOMDocument to preserve white space
before loading the document.

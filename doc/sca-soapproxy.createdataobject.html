Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

This method is used inside either an ordinary PHP script or an SCA component
that needs to create an SDO to pass to a web service. The parameters are the
desired SDO's namespace URI and type name. The namespace and type must be
defined in the interface of the component that is to be called, so the
namespace and type must be defined within the WSDL for the web service. If the
web service is also an SCA component then the types will have been defined
within one of the schema files which are specified on the @types annotation
within the component for which the SCA_SoapProxy object is a proxy.

参数

type_namespace_uri

    The namespace of the type.

type_name

    The name of the type.

返回值

Returns the newly created SDO_DataObject.

错误／异常

SDO_TypeNotFoundException

    Thrown if the namespaceURI and typeName do not correspond to a type found
    in the WSDL that was used to initialise this SCA_SoapProxy.

OCI-Lob::setBuffering — Changes current state of buffering for the large object

说明

bool OCI-Lob::setBuffering ( bool $on_off )

Sets the buffering for the large object, depending on the value of the on_off
parameter.

Use of this function may provide performance improvements by buffering small
reads and writes of LOBs by reducing the number of network round-trips and LOB
versions. OCI-Lob::flush() should be used to flush buffers, when you have
finished working with the large object.

参数

on_off

    TRUE for on and FALSE for off.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。 Repeated calls to this method with
the same flag will return TRUE.

If you are getting an error like this:

Exception: DateTime::__construct(): Failed to parse time string (13/02/2013) at
position 0 (1): Unexpected character in DateTime->__construct()

Note that when you create a new date object using a format with slashes and
dashes (eg 02-02-2012 or 02/02/2012) it must be in the mm/dd/yy(yy) or mm-dd-yy
(yy) format (rather than british format dd/mm/yy)! Months always before years
(the american style) otherwise you'll get an incorrect date and may get an
error like the one above (where PHP is crashing on trying to decode a 13th
month).

Can catch you off guard because everything seems to be working fine and dandy
until you hit a value over 12.
===============================================================================

DateTime will recognise any number up to 12 as a [month], and any number up to
31 as a [day]; it calculates the resulting date to be [day] days after the
start of [month].  This means that when a datetime object is created with more
days than are found in that month, the date will be beyond the end of the
month.

<?php
  $test = new DateTime('02/31/2011');
  echo date_format($test, 'Y-m-d H:i:s'); // 2011-03-03 00:00:00
  $test = new DateTime('06/31/2011');
  echo date_format($test, 'Y-m-d H:i:s'); // 2011-07-01 00:00:00
?>

@Marton Bodonyi
This is not exactly true.

The following code:
[code]
echo "1\n";
print_r(date_create('13-02-2013'));
echo "2\n";
print_r(date_create('13/02/2013'));
echo "3\n";
print_r(new DateTime('13-02-2013'));
echo "4\n";
print_r(new DateTime('13/02/2013'));
[/code]

produces the following output:
[code]
1
DateTime Object
(
    [date] => 2013-02-13 00:00:00.000000
    [timezone_type] => 3
    [timezone] => Europe/London
)

)

Which means that only slashes format actually wants you to use American order
of date parts.
Hence you should use 'dd-mm-yyyy' or 'mm/dd/yyyy'
Which is weird, and should not be such.

PHP version is 5.4.40

If you want to create the DateTime object directly from a timestamp use this

<?php
$st = 1170288000 //  a timestamp
$dt = new DateTime("@$st");
?>

Indeed as mentioned above the constructor for DateTime  will allow the day of
month upto 31 to be accepted for all months of the year. You should use
checkdate if you wish to check that the day of the month represents a valid
gregorian calendar date.
===============================================================================

You should also be aware that DateTime has very lax date validation rules. It
appears that all months have a maximum of 31 days.

For example, these will work fine:

<?php
  $test = new DateTime('02/31/2011');
  $test = new DateTime('06/31/2011');
?>

We all know that these dates are not real and are invalid so I think a good
idea is to do some further validation on dates before creating a DateTime
object with them.

Looks like the DateTime class does not exist in my PHP 5.1.5 installation. The
only documentation I can find says this class shows up in PHP 5.2
===============================================================================

"String in a format accepted by strtotime()" is not 100% truth - you cannot
pass timezone info in the string used as DateTime constructor, while you can do
it with strtotime(). It may be a problem if you would like to create a date
from GMT time and then display it in your local timezone, for example:

<?php
    $timeZone = 'Europe/Warsaw';  // +2 hours
    date_default_timezone_set($timeZone);
   
    $dateSrc = '2007-04-19 12:50 GMT';
    $dateTime = new DateTime($dateSrc);
   
    echo 'date(): '.date('H:i:s', strtotime($dateSrc));
    // correct! date(): 14:50:00
   
    echo 'DateTime::format(): '.$dateTime->format('H:i:s');
    // INCORRECT! DateTime::format(): 12:50:00
?>

[red. your claim that "is not 100% truth" is incorrect, you're seeing desired
behavior here. The timezone passed as 2nd argument is used as a default fall
back, in case the parsed string doesn't provide TZ information.]

So if you want to convert date between different timezones, you have to create
two DateTimeZone objects - one for the input and one for output, like this:

<?php
    $timeZone = 'Europe/Warsaw';  // +2 hours
    $dateSrc = '2007-04-19 12:50';
   
    $dateTime = new DateTime($dateSrc, new DateTimeZone('GMT'));
    $dateTime->setTimeZone(new DateTimeZone($timeZone));
    echo 'DateTime::format(): '.$dateTime->format('H:i:s');
    // CORRECT! DateTime::format(): 14:50:00
?>

I'm not sure if this is a bug or desired behaviour.
[red. you don't have to do create two DateTimeZone objects, this works too:
<?php
    $timeZone = 'Europe/Warsaw';  // +2 hours
    $dateSrc = '2007-04-19 12:50 GMT';
   
    $dateTime = new DateTime($dateSrc);
    $dateTime->setTimeZone(new DateTimeZone($timeZone));
    echo 'DateTime::format(): '.$dateTime->format('H:i:s');
    // CORRECT! DateTime::format(): 14:50:00
?>
]
===============================================================================

date_create and other DateTime related functions are included by default only
in PHP versions equal and greater than 5.2.

In PHP 5.1.2 this functionality is marked to be experimental and has to be
enabled at compile time.
===============================================================================

The construct have some problem with date validate.

When you set
$datetime = DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s','2009-02-30 00:00:00');

it will be accepted but convert to 2009-03-02 00:00:00, it means the date was
count on and plus 2 days

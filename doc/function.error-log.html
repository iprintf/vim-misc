error_log

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

error_log — 发送错误信息到某个地方

说明

bool error_log ( string $message [, int $message_type = 0 [, string
$destination [, string $extra_headers ]]] )

把错误信息发送到 web 服务器的错误日志，或者到一个文件里。

参数

message

    应该被记录的错误信息。

message_type

    设置错误应该发送到何处。可能的信息类型有以下几个：

                             error_log() 日志类型
    0 message 发送到 PHP 的系统日志，使用操作系统的日志机制或者一个文件，取决于
      error_log 指令设置了什么。这是个默认的选项。
    1 message 发送到参数 destination 设置的邮件地址。第四个参数 extra_headers
      只有在这个类型里才会被用到。
    2 不再是一个选项。
    3 message 被发送到位置为 destination 的文件里。字符 message 不会默认被当做
      新的一行。
    4 message 直接发送到 SAPI 的日志处理程序中。

destination

    目标。它的含义描述于以上，由 message_type 参数所决定。

extra_headers

    额外的头。当 message_type 设置为 1 的时候使用。该信息类型使用了 mail() 的同
    一个内置函数。

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                 说明
5.2.7 可能的值：4添加到了 message_type。

范例

Example #1 error_log() 范例

<?php
// 如果无法连接到数据库，发送通知到服务器日志
if (!Ora_Logon($username, $password)) {
    error_log("Oracle database not available!", 0);
}

// 如果用尽了 FOO，通过邮件通知管理员
if (!($foo = allocate_new_foo())) {
    error_log("Big trouble, we're all out of FOOs!", 1,
               "operator@example.com");
}

// 调用 error_log() 的另一种方式:
error_log("You messed up!", 3, "/var/tmp/my-errors.log");
?>

Advice to novices: This function works great along with "tail" which is a unix
command to watch a log file live. There are versions of Tail for Windows too,
like Tail for Win32 or Kiwi Log Viewer.

Using both error_log() and tail to view the php_error.log you can debug code
without having to worry so much about printing debug messages to the screen and
who they might be seen by.

Further Note: This works even better when you have two monitors setup. One for
your browser and IDE and the other for viewing the log files update live as you
go.
===============================================================================

There is a limit on the maximum length that you can pass as the $message.

The default seem to be 1024 but can be changed by adjusting the value of the
runtime configuration value of 'log_errors_max_len'.

More details here:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php
===============================================================================

When logging to apache on windows, both error_log and also trigger_error result
in an apache status of error on the front of the message. This is bad if all
you want to do is log information. However you can simply log to stderr however
you will have to do all message assembly:

LogToApache($Message) {
        $stderr = fopen('php://stderr', 'w');
        fwrite($stderr,$Message);
        fclose($stderr);
}
===============================================================================

It appears that the system log = stderr if you are running PHP from the command
line, and that often stderr = stdout.  This means that if you are using a
custom error to both display the error and log it to syslog, then a
command-line user will see the same error reported twice.
===============================================================================

Be carefull. Unexpected PHP dies when 2GByte of file log reached (on systems
having upper file size limit).
A work aorund is rotate logs :)
===============================================================================

If you are trying to capture PHP errors to a text file on IIS ensure that two
things are set.

1) Only one error log option is set. IE:

; Log errors to specified file.
error_log = "c:\php\errorlog.txt"

; Log errors to syslog (Event Log on NT, not valid in Windows 95).
;error_log = syslog

2) The IUSR account has write and modify permissions to e rrorlog.txt .
===============================================================================

when using error_log to send email, not all elements of an extra_headers string
are handled the same way.  "From: " and "Reply-To: " header values will replace
the default header values. "Subject: " header values won't: they are *added* to
the mail header but don't replace the default, leading to mail messages with
two Subject fields.

<?php

error_log("sometext", 1, "zigzag@my.domain",
  "Subject: Foo\nFrom: Rizzlas@my.domain\n");

?>

---------------%<-----------------------
To: zigzag@my.domain
Envelope-to: zigzag@my.domain
Date: Fri, 28 Mar 2003 13:29:02 -0500
From: Rizzlas@my.domain
Subject: PHP error_log message
Subject: Foo
Delivery-date: Fri, 28 Mar 2003 13:29:03 -0500

sometext
---------------%<---------------------

quoth the docs: "This message type uses the same internal function as mail()
does." 

mail() will also fail to set a Subject field based on extra_header data -
instead it takes a seperate argument to specify a "Subject: " string.

php v.4.2.3, SunOS 5.8
===============================================================================

If you have a problem with log file permission *silently*
it's best to leave error_log directive unset so errors will be written in your
Apache log file for current VirtualHost.
===============================================================================

"It appears that the system log = stderr if you are running PHP from the
command line"

Actually, it seems that PHP logs to stderr if it can't write to the log file.
Command line PHP falls back to stderr because the log file is (usually) only
writable by the webserver.
===============================================================================

Beware!  If multiple scripts share the same log file, but run as different
users, whichever script logs an error first owns the file, and calls to
error_log() run as a different user will fail *silently*!

Nothing more frustrating than trying to figure out why all your error_log calls
aren't actually writing, than to find it was due to a *silent* permission
denied error!
===============================================================================

Note that since typical email is unencrypted, sending data about your errors
over email using this function could be considered a security risk. How much of
a risk it is depends on how much and what type of information you are sending,
but the mere act of sending an email when something happens (even if it cannot
be read) could itself imply to a sophisticated hacker observing your site over
time that they have managed to cause an error.

Of course, security through obscurity is the weakest kind of security, as most
open source supporters will agree. This is just something that you should keep
in mind.

And of course, whatever you do, make sure that such emails don't contain
sensitive user data.

Hi !

Another trick to post "HTML" mail body. Just add "Content-Type: text/html;
charset=ISO-8859-1" into extra_header string. Of course you can set charset
according to your country or Env or content.

EG: Error_log("<html><h2>stuff</h2></html>",1,"eat@joe.com","subject  :lunch\
nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1");

Enjoy !

For beginners here is an example that will let you add audit code through your
program then choose which audits get logged.  helps keep your code clean as you
can add as many adit calls as you want and the configure deals with them

    // binary values
    define ("AUDIT_NORMAL",1);       // 00001
    define ("AUDIT_DB_INSERT",2);    // 00010

    define ("AUDIT_DB_EXTRACT",8);   // 01000
    define ("AUDIT_DB_DELETE",16);   // 10000
   
   
    // define some types of audit level
    define ("AUDIT_JUST_DB", AUDIT_DB_INSERT + AUDIT_DB_UPDATE +
AUDIT_DB_EXTRACT + AUDIT_DB_DELETE);
                                     // 11110
    define ("AUDIT_ALL",31);         // all possible options
                                     // 11111

In the case of missing your entries in the error_log file:
When you use error_log in a script that does not produce any output, which
means that you cannot see anything during the execution of the script, and when
you wonder why there are no error_log entries produced in your error_log file,
the reasons can be:
- you did not configure error_log output in php.ini
- the script has a syntax error and did therefore not execute
===============================================================================

It appears that error_log() only logs the first line of multi-line log
messages. To log a multi-line message, either log each line individually or
write the message to another file.
===============================================================================

Beware the size of your custom error_log!

Once it exceeds 2GB the function errors, ending your script at the error_log()
line.  I'm sure this differs from OS to OS, but I have seen it die writing to
ext2 under modern Linux systems.
===============================================================================

This had me hunting for a while till I figured this out.  What ever folder you
want your logs deposited to, don't create the log file yourself, let php do it
for you.  For some reason, if the log file already exists and it's 0 KB, PHP
will try to re-create the log file and fail in the process.  It never attempts
to write to the pre-existing empty file, just fails on folder creation.  Might
be do to the folder permissions I have on windows, but this is what I found
with read/write/modify permissions for IIS_IUSRS on Win2008.  Once PHP has
written to its self-created file successfully, it will append to the file on
new errors.  Process Monitor is my friend :)
===============================================================================

On a Mac running OS X, for the error logging to work I needed to put this in my
php.ini:
error_log = /tmp/php_errors.log
Attempting to put the log in other locations did not work, probably due to
permission issues.
===============================================================================

After scouring the internet for getting event logging to
work in syslog on Windows 2003, I found the following
from this post and was able to successfully get Windows
Event Viewer to log PHP errors/notices:

   1. Copy the PHP 5 binaries to "C:\php".
   2. Right-click My Computer and select Properties to bring
up the Computer Properties dialog. Switch to the Advanced
tab and click Environment Variables. Find the system
environment variable PATH, edit it and add ";C:\php"
(without the quotes) to the end.
   3. Make sure that the configuration file "php.ini" resides
in the directory "C:\php" and contains the correct path
settings.
   4. DELETE any old "php.ini" files from "C:\WINDOWS"
and other directories.
   5. Open REGEDIT, navigate to the key
"HKLM\SOFTWARE\PHP" and DELETE the string value
"IniFilePath" from there. It is outdated and no longer
necessary!
   6. Modify NTFS security permissions of the directory
"C:\php" to give Read and Execute permissions to (1) the
IIS Guest Account and (2) the group IIS_WPG.
   7. Modify NTFS security permissions of the directories
"C:\php\session" and "C:\php\upload" to give additional
Modify permissions to (1) the IIS Guest Account and (2)
the group IIS_WPG.
   8. Navigate to the registry key
"HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog
\Application" and edit the value "CustomSD" there. Find
the substring "(D;;0xf0007;;;BG)" which Denies access to
the application event log for Builtin Guest accounts (like
the IIS Web User account) and replace this substring with
"(A;;0x3;;;BG)" which allows read and write access. Please
pay attention to leave the rest of the security string intact.
Damaging this value can have dangerous effects!
   9. Create or update the registry key
"HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\Application\
PHP-5.2.0" (adapt the last to your version part
if necessary) with the following values:

          * "EventMessageFile" (REG_EXPAND_SZ) = "C:\php\php5ts.dll"

          * "TypesSupported" (REG_DWORD) = 7
===============================================================================

When starting Apache from a user context other than Apache's runtime user, the
error log file (if one is specified) may be created under the starting user if
it did not previously exist.

For example, I had specified the incorrect filename for my browscap.ini file,
and would only see this error in the log file upon each restart of Apache. 
Because of this, I assumed I'd configured logging correctly:

[24-Feb-2010 12:33:04] PHP Warning:  Cannot open '/etc/php5/apache/
lite_php_browscap.ini' for reading in Unknown on line 0

No other errors would log at runtime even though I had originally set the owner
of the log directory to www-data (Apache runs under this user context).  My
file (error.log) was being created with the owner = root, because I had
restarted the apache2 service as root after configuring the log file location. 
(I made the poor assumption that since PHP/Apache had created the file it was
created by www-data, so I hadn't looked).

Changing owner of the log file to the correct user (i.e. www-data) fixed the
problem.

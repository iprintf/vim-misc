The MongoException class

(PECL mongo >= 1.0.0)

简介

Default Mongo exception.

This covers a bunch of different error conditions that may eventually be moved
to more specific exceptions, but will always extend MongoException.

  • The MongoSomething object has not been correctly initialized by its
    constructor

    Code: 0

    Probably your Mongo object is not connected to a database server.

  • zero-length keys are not allowed, did you use $ with double quotes?

    Code: 1

    You tried to save "" as a key. You generally should not do this. "" can
    mess up subobject access and is used by MongoDB internally. However, if you
    really want, you can set mongo.allow_empty_keys to true in your php.ini
    file to override this sanity check. If you override this, it is highly
    recommended that you set error checking to strict to avoid string
    interpolation errors.

  • '.' not allowed in key: <key>

    Code: 2

    You attempted to write a key with '.' in it, which is prohibited.

  • insert too large: <size>, max: <max>

    Code: 3

    You're attempting to send too much data to the database at once: the
    database will only accept inserts up to a certain size (currently 16 MB).

  • no elements in doc

    Code: 4

    You're attempting to save a document with no fields.

  • size of BSON doc is <size> bytes, max <max>MB

    Code: 5

    You're attempting to save a document that is larger than MongoDB can save.

  • no documents given

    Code: 6

    You're attempting to batch insert an empty array of documents.

  • MongoCollection::group takes an array, object, or MongoCode key

    Code: 7

    Wrong type parameter send to MongoCollection::group().

  • field names must be strings

    Code: 8

    You should format field selectors as array("field1" => 1, "field2" => 1,
    ..., "fieldN" => 1).

  • invalid regex

    Code: 9

    The regex passed to MongoRegex is not of the correct form.

  • MongoDBRef::get: $ref field must be a string

    Code: 10

  • MongoDBRef::get: $db field must be a string

    Code: 11

  • non-utf8 string: <str>

    Code: 12

    This error occurs if you attempt to send a non-utf8 string to the database.
    All strings going into the database should be UTF8. See php.ini options for
    the transition option of quieting this exception.

  • mutex error: <err>

    Code: 13

    The driver uses mutexes for synchronizing requests and responses in
    multithreaded environments. This is a fairly serious error and may not have
    a stack trace. It's unusual and should be reported to maintainers with any
    system information and steps to reproduce that you can provide.

  • index name too long: <len>, max <max> characters

    Code: 14

    Indexes with names longer than 128 characters cannot be created. If you get
    this error, you should use MongoCollection::ensureIndex()'s "name" option
    to create a shorter name for your index.

===============================================================================

In case of "zero-length keys are not allowed, did you use $ with double quotes?
" error, checking the saved data for objects with private/protected variables
can solve the problem.

It seems, that the PECL extension currently does not support private/protected
variables, thus making their keys empty strings. A simple, yet not allways
desirable, solution is to make these variables public.

Example:
<?php
class Example
{
    private $value;
    protected $output;
}
?>php
will throw an exception.

<?php
class Example
{
    public $value;
    public $output;
}
?>php
Will not throw an exception

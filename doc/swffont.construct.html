SWFFont::__construct — Loads a font definition

说明

SWFFont::__construct ( string $filename )
Warning

此函数是实验性的。此函数的表象，包括名称及其相关文档都可能在未来的 PHP 发布版本
中未通知就被修改。使用本函数风险自担。

If filename is the name of an FDB file (i.e., it ends in ".fdb"), load the font
definition found in said file. Otherwise, create a browser-defined font
reference.

FDB ("font definition block") is a very simple wrapper for the SWF DefineFont2
block which contains a full description of a font. One may create FDB files
from SWT Generator template files with the included makefdb utility- look in
the util directory off the main ming distribution directory.

Browser-defined fonts don't contain any information about the font other than
its name. It is assumed that the font definition will be provided by the movie
player. The fonts _serif, _sans, and _typewriter should always be available.
For example:
<?php
$f = newSWFFont("_sans"); 
?>
will give you the standard sans-serif font, probably the same as what you'd get
with <font name="sans-serif"> in HTML.

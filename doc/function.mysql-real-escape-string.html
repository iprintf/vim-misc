mysql_real_escape_string

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)

mysql_real_escape_string — 转义 SQL 语句中使用的字符串中的特殊字符，并考虑到连
接的当前字符集

说明

string mysql_real_escape_string ( string $unescaped_string [, resource
$link_identifier ] )

本函数将 unescaped_string 中的特殊字符转义，并计及连接的当前字符集，因此可以安
全用于 mysql_query()。

    Note: mysql_real_escape_string() 并不转义 % 和 _。

Example #1 mysql_real_escape_string() 例子

<?php
$item = "Zak's and Derick's Laptop";
$escaped_item = mysql_real_escape_string($item);
printf ("Escaped string: %s\n", $escaped_item);
?>

以上例子将产生如下输出：

Escaped string: Zak\'s and Derick\'s Laptop

Just a little function which mimics the original mysql_real_escape_string but
which doesn't need an active mysql connection. Could be implemented as a static
function in a database class. Hope it helps someone.

<?php
function mysql_escape_mimic($inp) {
    if(is_array($inp))
        return array_map(__METHOD__, $inp);

    if(!empty($inp) && is_string($inp)) {
        return str_replace(array('\\', "\0", "\n", "\r", "'", '"', "\x1a"),
array('\\\\', '\\0', '\\n', '\\r', "\\'", '\\"', '\\Z'), $inp);
    }

    return $inp;
}
?>

===============================================================================

Note that mysql_real_escape_string doesn't prepend backslashes to \x00, \n, \r,
and and \x1a as mentionned in the documentation, but actually replaces the
character with a MySQL acceptable representation for queries (e.g. \n is
replaced with the '\n' litteral). (\, ', and " are escaped as documented) This
doesn't change how you should use this function, but I think it's good to know.
===============================================================================

No discussion of escaping is complete without telling everyone that you should
basically never use external input to generate interpreted code. This goes for
SQL statements, or anything you would call any sort of "eval" function on.

So, instead of using this terribly broken function, use parametric prepared
statements instead.

Honestly, using user provided data to compose SQL statements should be
considered professional negligence and you should be held accountable by your
employer or client for not using parametric prepared statements.

What does that mean?

It means instead of building a SQL statement like this:

"INSERT INTO X (A) VALUES(".$_POST["a"].")"

You should use mysqli's prepare() function (http://php.net/manual/en/
mysqli.prepare.php) to execute a statement that looks like this:

"INSERT INTO X (A) VALUES(?)"

NB: This doesn't mean you should never generate dynamic SQL statements. What it
means is that you should never use user-provided data to generate those
statements. Any user-provided data should be passed through as parameters to
the statement after it has been prepared.

So, for example, if you are building up a little framework and want to do an
insert to a table based on the request URI, it's in your best interest to not
take the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] value (or any part of it) and directly
concatenate that with your query. Instead,  you should parse out the portion of
the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] value that you want, and map that through some kind
of function or associative array to a non-user provided value. If the mapping
produces no value, you know that something is wrong with the user provided
data.

Failing to follow this has been the cause of a number of SQL-injection problems
in the Ruby On Rails framework, even though it uses parametric prepared
statements. This is how GitHub was hacked at one point. So, no language is
immune to this problem. That's why this is a general best practice and not
something specific to PHP and why you should REALLY adopt it.

Also, you should still do some kind of validation of the data provided by
users, even when using parametric prepared statements. This is because that
user-provided data will often become part of some generated HTML, and you want
to ensure that the user provided data isn't going to cause security problems in
the browser.
===============================================================================

There's an interesting quirk in the example #2 about SQL injection:  AND takes
priority over OR, so the injected query actually executes as WHERE (user=
'aidan' AND password='') OR ''='', so instead of returning a database record
corresponding to an arbitrary username (in this case 'aidan'), it would
actually return ALL database records.  In no particular order.  So an attacker
might be able to log in as any account, but not necessarily with any control
over which account it is.

Of course a potential attacker could simply modify their parameters to target
specific users of interest:

<?php

// E.g. attacker's values
$_POST['username'] = '';
$_POST['password'] = "' OR user = 'administrator' AND '' = '";

// Malformed query
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='$_POST[username]' AND password='
$_POST[password]'";

echo $query;

// The query sent to MySQL would read:
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='' AND password='' OR user='administrator'
AND ''='';
// which would allow anyone to gain access to the account named 'administrator'

?>
===============================================================================

Don't forget that if you're using Mysqli (ie, the "improved" Mysql extension)
then you need to use the corresponding mysqli function
mysqli_real_escape_string().  The parameter order is also different.
===============================================================================

If you want to make sure that the ID you're using to do a query is a number,
use sprint() of (int) or intval(), but don't use mysql_real_escape_string.

There is no difference between ISO-8859-1's number 10 and UTF-8's number 10.

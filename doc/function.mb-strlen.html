mb_strlen

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mb_strlen — 获取字符串的长度

说明

mixed mb_strlen ( string $str [, string $encoding = mb_internal_encoding() ] )

获取一个 string 的长度。

参数

str

    要检查长度的字符串。

encoding

    encoding 参数为字符编码。如果省略，则使用内部字符编码。

返回值

返回具有 encoding 编码的字符串 str 包含的字符数。多字节的字符被计为 1。

如果给定的 encoding 无效则返回 FALSE。

If you are unsure about what $encoding can be set to, here's a full list of all
the encodings supported by this extension:

Speed of mb_strlen varies a lot according to specified character set.

If you need length of string in bytes (strlen cannot be trusted anymore because
of mbstring.func_overload) you should use <?php mb_strlen($string, '8bit'); ?>.
It's the fastest way (still a way slower than strlen, though) to determine byte
length of string. Other single byte character sets (ASCII, ISO-8859-1, ...) are
several times slower than 8bit.

Just did a little benchmarking (1.000.000 times with lorem ipsum text) on the
mbs functions

especially mb_strtolower and mb_strtoupper are really slow (up to 100 times
slower compared to normal functions). Other functions are alike-ish, but
sometimes up to 5 times slower.

just be cautious when using mb_ functions in high frequented scripts.

If you find yourself without the mb string functions and can't easily change
it, a quick hack replacement for mb_strlen for utf8 characters is to use a a
PCRE regex with utf8 turned on.

$strlen = preg_match_all("/.{1}/us",$utf8string,$dummy);

This is basically an ugly hack which counts all single character matches, and
I'd expect it to be painfully slow on large strings.
===============================================================================

If you wish to find the byte length of a multi-byte string when you are using
mbstring.func_overload 2 and UTF-8 strings, then you can use the following:

mb_strlen($utf8_string, 'latin1');
===============================================================================

Thank you Peter Albertsson for presenting that!

After spending more than eight hours tracking down two specific bugs in my
mbstring-func_overloaded environment I have learned a very important lesson:

Many developers rely on strlen to give the amount of bytes in a string. While
mb-overloading has very many advantages, the most hard-spotted pitfall must be
this issue.

Two examples (from the two bugs found earlier):

1. Writing a string to a file:

<?php
$str = "string with utf-8 chars åèä - doo-bee doo-bee dooh";
$fp = fopen($this->_file, "wb");
if ($fp) {
  $len = strlen($str);
  fwrite($fp, $str, $len);
}
?>

PS This is found i the PEAR::Cache_Lite package (Lite.php) - Reported

2. Iterating through a string's characters:

<?php
$str = "string with utf-8 chars åèö - doo-bee doo-bee dooh";
$newStr = "";
for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($str); $i++) {
  $newStr .= $str[$i];
}
?>

Both of these situations will fail to save / store the last characters in $str.
This can be very hard to spot and can be especially fatal for say serialized
strings, xml etc.

So, try to avoid these situations to support overloaded environments, and
remeber Peter Albertssons remark if you find problems under such an
environment.

I have been working with some funny html characters lately and due to the
nightmare in manipulating them between mysql and php, I got the database column
set to utf8, then store characters with html enity "&#7885;" as ọ in the
database and set the encoding on php as "utf8".

This is where mb_strlen became more useful than strlen.  While strlen('ọ')
gives result as 3, mb_strlen('ọ','UTF-8') gives 1 as expected.

But left(column1,1) in mysql still gives wrong char for a multibyte string.  In
the example above, I had to do left(column1,3) to get the correct string from
mysql.  I am now about to investigate multibyte manipulation in mysql.

===============================================================================

The definitions of some of these control codes can be found here (URL broken
due to comment system, sorry about that!): http://msdn.microsoft.com/library
/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/handler.asp

However, for your convenience (and mine):
SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP, 0x00000001
Notifies a service that it should stop.

If a service accepts this control code, it must stop upon receipt. After the
SCM sends this control code, it does not send other control codes.

Windows XP/2000:  If the service returns NO_ERROR and continues to run, it
continues to receive control codes. This behavior changed starting with Windows
Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2.

SERVICE_CONTROL_PAUSE, 0x00000002
Notifies a service that it should pause.
(Although I guess that there is no requirement that you must.)

SERVICE_CONTROL_CONTINUE, 0x00000003
Notifies a paused service that it should resume.

SERVICE_CONTROL_INTERROGATE, 0x00000004
Notifies a service that it should report its current status information to the
service control manager.
(I'm guessing that a call to win32_set_service_status() would satisfy
interrogation?)

SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN, 0x00000005
Notifies a service that the system is shutting down so the service can perform
cleanup tasks.

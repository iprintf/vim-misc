stream_set_timeout

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

stream_set_timeout — Set timeout period on a stream

说明

bool stream_set_timeout ( resource $stream , int $seconds [, int $microseconds
= 0 ] )

Sets the timeout value on stream, expressed in the sum of seconds and
microseconds.

When the stream times out, the 'timed_out' key of the array returned by 
stream_get_meta_data() is set to TRUE, although no error/warning is generated.

参数

stream

    The target stream.

seconds

    The seconds part of the timeout to be set.

microseconds

    The microseconds part of the timeout to be set.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      As of PHP 4.3, this function can (potentially) work on any kind of
4.3.0 stream. In PHP 4.3, socket based streams are still the only kind
      supported in the PHP core, although streams from other extensions may
      support this function.

范例

Example #1 stream_set_timeout() example

<?php
$fp = fsockopen("www.example.com", 80);
if (!$fp) {
    echo "Unable to open\n";
} else {

    fwrite($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n");
    stream_set_timeout($fp, 2);
    $res = fread($fp, 2000);

    $info = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
    fclose($fp);

    if ($info['timed_out']) {
        echo 'Connection timed out!';
    } else {
        echo $res;
    }

}
?>

注释

    Note:

    This function doesn't work with advanced operations like 
    stream_socket_recvfrom(), use stream_select() with timeout parameter
    instead.

This function was previously called as set_socket_timeout() and later 
socket_set_timeout() but this usage is deprecated.

In case anyone is puzzled, stream_set_timeout DOES NOT work for sockets created
with socket_create or socket_accept. Use socket_set_option instead.

Instead of:
<?php
stream_set_timeout($socket,$sec,$usec);
?>

Use:
<?php
socket_set_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, array('sec'=>$sec, 'usec'=>
$usec));
socket_set_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDTIMEO, array('sec'=>$sec, 'usec'=>
$usec));
?>
===============================================================================

Here is a working example for loops:

<?php
// Timeout in seconds
$timeout = 5;

$fp = fsockopen("www.server.com", 80, $errno, $errstr, $timeout);

if ($fp) {
        fwrite($fp, "GET /file.php HTTP/1.0\r\n");
        fwrite($fp, "Host: www.server.com\r\n");
        fwrite($fp, "Connection: Close\r\n\r\n");

        stream_set_blocking($fp, TRUE);
        stream_set_timeout($fp,$timeout);
        $info = stream_get_meta_data($fp);

        while ((!feof($fp)) && (!$info['timed_out'])) {
                $data .= fgets($fp, 4096);
                $info = stream_get_meta_data($fp);
                ob_flush;
                flush();
        }

        if ($info['timed_out']) {
                echo "Connection Timed Out!";
        } else {
                echo $data;
        }
}
?>
===============================================================================

If the timeout fails, because the server remains completely silent, one may
have to add stream_select() to make the timeout work. This may be much more
efficient that a non-blocking reading operation.

<?php
stream_set_timeout($c, $timeout);
$data = '';
$stR = array($this->smtp_conn);
$stW = null;
while (is_resource($c) && !feof($c)) {
    if (!stream_select($stR, $stW, $stW, $timeout)) {
        trigger_error('Timeout');
        break;
    }
    $str = fgets($c, 515);
    $data.= $str;

    // Handling of "traditional" timeout
    $info = stream_get_meta_data($c);
     if ($info['timed_out']) {
        trigger_error('Timeout');
        break;
    }
}
?>

Background: We had issues with a SMTP server that was addresses unencrypted
while expecting TLS encryption. The stream_set_timeout() alone did not work as
expected and the script hung for an hour or more.

This function seems to have no effect when running as a CLI script, see http://

Another note alread states that blocking-reads may be an issue, if the
counterpart responds very slowly - or not at all. The stream timeout may not
work as expected in such a situation.

However, php.net provides very little information on how to use non-blocking
reading operations. Here's a code sample:

<?php
        stream_set_timeout($c, $timeout);
        $data = '';
        while (is_resource($c) && !feof($c)) {
            // Use non-blocking reading for first loop
            if (($data === '') and ($timeout > 0)) {
                stream_set_blocking($c, false);
                $endtimeOut = time() + $timeout;
                $str = '';
                while ((time() < $endtimeOut) and (strlen($str) < 515) and !
feof($c)) {
                    sleep(1);  // Note: This may require tuning
                    $str.= fgets($c, 515);
                }
                // Handling first-read timeout
                if (time() >= $endtimeOut) {
                    trigger_error('Timeout', E_USER_WARNING);
                    break;
                }
                stream_set_blocking($c, true);
            } else {
                $str = fgets($c, 515);
            }
            $data.= $str;

            // Handling of "traditional" timeout
            $info = stream_get_meta_data($c);
            if ($info['timed_out']) {
                    trigger_error('Timeout', E_USER_WARNING);
                    break;
            }
        }
?>

If you are using fsockopen() to create a connection, first going to write into
the stream and then waiting for the reply (e.g. simulating HTTP request with
some extra headers), then stream_set_timeout() must be set only after the write
- if it is before write, it has no effect on the read timeout :-(
Noticed at least on PHP/4.3.10
===============================================================================

stream_set_timeout() is not suitable for such files as UNIX-devices (/dev/...),
i suggest to use select() instead with desirable timeout value - that works
well.
===============================================================================

I have found it required to add

"stream_set_blocking($fp, FALSE )"

prior to any fgets(), fread(), etc. to prevent the code from hanging up when
remote files are called and the response is slow.
===============================================================================

I have found that in order to actually stop the socket from timing out the
script, you must call stream_get_meta_data and check for a timeout within the
loop reading from the socket.

Example:

<?php
$sock = fsockopen($host, 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);
if(!$sock){
    echo "Unable to get server status";
}else{
    $out = "GET /server.php HTTP/1.1\r\n";
    $out .= "Host: $host\r\n";
    $out .= "Connection: Close\r\n\r\n";

    fwrite($sock, $out);

    stream_set_blocking($fp, FALSE );
    stream_set_timeout($sock, $timeout);
    $info = stream_get_meta_data($sock);

    while (!feof($sock) && !$info['timed_out']) {
        $file .= fgets($sock, 4096);
        $info = stream_get_meta_data($sock);
    }

    fclose($sock);
?>
===============================================================================

I didn't have much luck with the suggestions below (although I likely applied
them wrong).
Instead, I used stream_context_create() and set an http option for timeout. I
fed that context into file_get_contents() and voila!

To my desperate friend below: the https transport can also use the http stream
context options. I haven't verified this works as I don't have a slow
responding ssl to test on. But if you are still stressing, give the below a
shot (you may need to modify a bit...)

<?php
    $timeout = 5*60;
    $options = array(
          'http'=>array(
            'method'=>"GET",
            'header'=>"Accept-language: en\r\n",
              'timeout' => $timeout
              )
        );
    $context = stream_context_create($options);
    $contents = file_get_contents($source, false, $context);
?>

Yes...that is a 5 minute timeout.
===============================================================================

Just in case someone stumbles into my situation... I was trying to get the
microseconds part to work and it just wasn't working as expected.

Assuming blocking mode is true and I use

<?php stream_set_timeout($s, 1, 0);?>

I get a 1s delay as expected. However when I do

<?php stream_set_timeout($s, 0, 500);?>

I expect a 500microsecond delay but I get no delays at all. However when i do
this

<?php stream_set_timeout($s, 0, 500000);?>

I get a 500 microsecond delay which is what I was expecting

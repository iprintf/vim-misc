SessionHandler::close

(PHP 5 >= 5.4.0, PHP 7)

SessionHandler::close — Close the session

说明

public bool SessionHandler::close ( void )

Closes the current session. This method is automatically executed internally by
PHP when closing the session, or explicitly via session_write_close() (which
first calls the SessionHandler::write()).

This method wraps the internal PHP save handler defined in the
session.save_handler ini setting that was set before this handler was activated
by session_set_save_handler().

If this class is extended by inheritiance, calling the parent close method will
invoke the wrapper for this method and therefor invoke the associated internal
callback. This allows the method to be overidden and or intercepted.

For more information on what this method is expected to do, please refer to the
documentation at SessionHandlerInterface::close().

sleep

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sleep — 延缓执行

说明

int sleep ( int $seconds )

程序延迟执行指定的 seconds 的秒数。

参数

seconds

    暂停的秒数。

返回值

成功时返回 0，错误时返回 FALSE。

如果函数的调用被一个信号中止，sleep() 会返回一个非零的值。在Windows上，该值总是
192（即Windows API常量WAIT_IO_COMPLETION的值）。其他平台上，该返回值是剩余未
sleep的秒数。

错误／异常

如果指定的 seconds 是负数，该函数会产生一个 E_WARNING 级别的错误。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.3.4 在PHP 5.3.4之前，Windows平台下无论 sleep() 是否成功调用，总是会返回一个
      NULL。

范例

Example #1 sleep() 的例子

<?php

// current time
echo date('h:i:s') . "\n";

// sleep for 10 seconds
sleep(10);

// wake up !
echo date('h:i:s') . "\n";

?>

该例子会在休眠10秒后输出。

05:31:23
05:31:33

This may seem obvious, but I thought I would save someone from something that
just confused me: you cannot use sleep() to sleep for fractions of a second.
This:

<?php sleep(0.25) ?>

will not work as expected. The 0.25 is cast to an integer, so this is
equivalent to sleep(0). To sleep for a quarter of a second, use:

<?php usleep(250000) ?>

re: "mitigating the chances of a full bruit force attack by a limit of 30
lookups a minute."

Not really - the attacker could do 100 requests. Each request might take 2
seconds but it doesn't stop the number of requests done. You need to stop
processing more than one request every 2 seconds rather than delay it by 2
seconds on each execution.
===============================================================================

You should put sleep into both the pass and fail branches, since an attacker
can check whether the response is slow and use that as an indicator - cutting
down the delay time. But a delay in both branches eliminates this possibility.
===============================================================================

A really simple, but effective way of majorly slowing down bruit force attacks
on wrong password attempts.

In my example below, if the end-user gets the password correct, they get to log
in at full speed, as expected. For every incorrect password attempt, the users
response is delayed by 2 seconds each time; mitigating the chances of a full
bruit force attack by a limit of 30 lookups a minute.

I hope this very simple approach will help make your web applications that
little bit more secure.

<?php
public function handle_login() {
    if($uid = user::check_password($_REQUEST['email'], $_REQUEST['password']))
{
        return self::authenticate_user($uid);
    }
    else {
        // delay failed output by 2 seconds
        // to prevent bruit force attacks
        sleep(2);
        return self::login_failed();
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Note: The set_time_limit() function and the configuration directive
max_execution_time only affect the execution time of the script itself. Any
time spent on activity that happens outside the execution of the script such as
system calls using system(), the sleep() function, database queries, etc. is
not included when determining the maximum time that the script has been
running.
===============================================================================

This will allow you to use negative values or valuer below 1 second.

<?php slaap(0.5); ?>

<?php
function slaap($seconds)
{
    $seconds = abs($seconds);
    if ($seconds < 1):
       usleep($seconds*1000000);
    else:
       sleep($seconds);
    endif;   
}
?>
===============================================================================

To use float or int numbers

function pause($seconds)
{
    usleep($seconds * 1000000);
}

pause(0.25);
===============================================================================

it is a bad idea to use sleep() for delayed output effects as

1) you have to flush() output before you sleep

2) depending on your setup flush() will not work all the way to the browser as
the web server might apply buffering of its own or the browser might not render
output it thinks not to be complete

netscape for example will only display complete lines and will not show table
parts until the </table> tag arrived

so use sleep if you have to wait  for events and don't want to burn  to much
cycles, but don't use it for silly delayed output effects!
===============================================================================

If you are having issues with sleep() and usleep() not responding as you feel
they should, take a look at session_write_close()

as noted by anonymous on comments;
"If the ajax function doesn't do session_write_close(), then your outer page
will appear to hang, and opening other pages in new tabs will also stall."
===============================================================================

Another reason for not to abuse sleep( ) is that along with the maximum of 30
sql connections, a shared hosting environment usually limits the number of
processes to 20, if your website has many users online and you put sleep( )
everywhere in the code, your server will throw a 508 error (resource limit
reached) and will stop serving your website.
===============================================================================

Always close your SQL connection and free the memory before using sleep( ) or
you will be needlessly holding a SQL connection for [xx] seconds, remember that
a shared hosting environment only allows max 30 SQL connections at the same
time.
===============================================================================

Simple function to report the microtime since last called or the microtime
since first called.

<?php
function stopWatch($total = false,$reset = true){
    global $first_called;
    global $last_called;
    $now_time = microtime(true);
    if ($last_called === null) {
        $last_called = $now_time;
        $first_called = $now_time;
    }
    if ($total) {
        $time_diff = $now_time - $first_called;
    } else {
        $time_diff = $now_time - $last_called;
    }
    if ($reset)
        $last_called = $now_time;
    return $time_diff;
}
?>

$reset  - if true, resets the last_called value to now
$total - if true, returns the time since first called otherwise returns the
time since last called
===============================================================================

Since sleep() can be interrupted by signals i've made a function which can also
be interrupted, but will continue sleeping after the signal arrived (and
possibly was handled by callback). It's very useful when you write daemons and
need sleep() function to work as long as you 'ordered', but have an ability to
accept signals during sleeping.

<?php
function my_sleep($seconds)
{
    $start = microtime(true);
    for ($i = 1; $i <= $seconds; $i ++) {
        @time_sleep_until($start + $i);
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Remember that sleep() means "Let PHP time to do some other stuff".
That means that sleep() can be interrupted by signals. That is important if you
work with pcntl_signal() and friends.
===============================================================================

This is a critical thing to use time delay function as sleep() Because a
beginner can find that this is not working and he/she will see that all output
appearing at a time.

A good way to implement this is by using the function -  ob_implicit_flush()
then you don't need to use flush() function explicitly.

A sample code :
<?php
ob_implicit_flush(true);
for($i=0;$i<5;$i++)
{
$dis=<<<DIS
<div style="width:200px; background-color:lime;border:1px; text-align:center;
text-decoration:blink;">
$i
</div>
DIS;
echo $dis;

sleep(5);
//flush();
}
===============================================================================

Here is a simplified way to flush output to browser before completing sleep
cycle.  Note the buffer must be "filled" with 4096 characters (bytes?) for
ob_flush() to work before sleep() occurs.
<?php
ob_implicit_flush(true);
$buffer = str_repeat(" ", 4096);
echo "see this immediately.<br>";
echo $buffer;
ob_flush();
sleep(5);
echo "some time has passed";
?>
===============================================================================

Notice that sleep() delays execution for the current session, not just the
script. Consider the following sample, where two computers invoke the same
script from a browser, which doesn't do anything but sleep.

PC 1 [started 14:00:00]: script.php?sleep=10 // Will stop after 10 secs
PC 1 [started 14:00:03]: script.php?sleep=0 // Will stop after 7 secs

PC 2 [started 14:00:05]: script.php?sleep=0 // Will stop immediately

http://php.net/session_write_close may be used to address this problem.
===============================================================================

Very useful to prevent password brute forcing! Simply add few seconds timeout
to login script and the probability to guess the password decreases a lot!
===============================================================================

I hope this code will help somebody to solve the problem of not being able to
flush or output the buffer to the browser (I use IE7).
It may work for you with just [ echo str_repeat(".", 4096); ] and without even
using ob_... and flush.

<?php
ob_start();

ob_implicit_flush(true);
//[ OR ] echo "..."; ob_flush(); flush();

set_time_limit(0);

function sleep_echo($secs) {
    $secs = (int) $secs;
    $buffer = str_repeat(".", 4096);
    //echo $buffer."\r\n<br />\r\n";
    for ($i=0; $i<$secs; $i++) {
        echo date("H:i:s", time())." (".($i+1).")"."\r\n<br />\r\n".$buffer."\r
\n<br />\r\n";
        ob_flush();
        flush();
        sleep(1);
        //usleep(1000000);
    }
}

sleep_echo(30);

ob_end_flush();
?>
===============================================================================

Maybe obvious, but this my function to delay script execution using decimals
for seconds (to mimic sleep(1.5) for example):

<?php
/**
* Delays execution of the script by the given time.
* @param mixed $time Time to pause script execution. Can be expressed
* as an integer or a decimal.
* @example msleep(1.5); // delay for 1.5 seconds
* @example msleep(.1); // delay for 100 milliseconds
*/
function msleep($time)
{
    usleep($time * 1000000);
}
?>

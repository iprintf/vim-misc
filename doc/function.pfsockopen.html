pfsockopen

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

pfsockopen — 打开一个持久的网络连接或者Unix套接字连接。

说明

resource pfsockopen ( string $hostname [, int $port = -1 [, int &$errno [, 
string &$errstr [, float $timeout = ini_get("default_socket_timeout") ]]]] )

这个函数的作用与fsockopen()完全一样的，不同的地方在于当在脚本执行完后，连接一直
不会关闭。可以说它是fsockopen()的长连接版本。

参数

对于其参数的信息，请参考fsockopen()的文档。

pfsockopen() works great on IIS/Windows7 installation, it keeps connection open
which is good for performance. However, there is one caveat: when connection is
broken because of physical net failure, pfsockopen() returns handle as if
connection was working. Subsequent call to fwrite() returns false so you have
information about error. The problem is that after physical net connection is
restored the situation doesn't change: pfsockopen() still returns handle and
fwrite() returns false. In other words, PHP sticks to old connection that is
not working (if you use fsockopen() instead, it will connect properly).
Situation goes back to normal after 30 minutes when PHP closes unused
connection.
The solution to this problem is to call fclose() on socket handle when fwrite()
returns false.
===============================================================================

To see if it's really a new connection, or a reused one, you can use ftell() -
and see if ther's been any traffic on the connection. If it's more than 0, then
it's a reused connection.

Here is how to POST a form action to a SSL server's cgi and retrieve output
with pfsockopen

<?php

$host = gethostbyaddr($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);

# working vars
$host = 'www.example.com';
$service_uri = '/cgi-bin/processACT';
$vars ='code=22&act=TEST';

# compose HTTP request header
$header = "Host: $host\r\n";
$header .= "User-Agent: PHP Script\r\n";
$header .= "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n";
$header .= "Content-Length: ".strlen($vars)."\r\n";
$header .= "Connection: close\r\n\r\n";

$fp = pfsockopen("ssl://".$host, 443, $errno, $errstr);
if (!$fp) {
   echo "$errstr ($errno)<br/>\n";
   echo $fp;
} else {
    fputs($fp, "POST $service_uri  HTTP/1.1\r\n");
    fputs($fp, $header.$vars);
    fwrite($fp, $out);
    while (!feof($fp)) {
        echo fgets($fp, 128);
    }
    fclose($fp);
}

?>

Persistent connections either in socket or databases should be used only in
servers where the limits are well defined. For example, the number of allowed
connections in a database must be greater than the number of Apache's
processes, or the connections will be refused by the database (this will surely
occur if you use persistent connections). The same may occur with socket
connections. This is up to the service configuration. In my opinion, persistent
connections are useful only if you have total control over the one or more
servers involved, like on a heavy loaded dedicated server for example, where
the little gain in performance worth the use of such connections. Never use
them in a shared server.
===============================================================================

Confusion arises as to when PHP starts a new connection using all the
"persistent" versions of any function, and this depends entirely on how you
run your PHP.

In real CGI mode, that is, one process per script, persistent functions do the
exact same as their "temporary" equivalents. If you have a threaded Apache
MPM, this persistence will open a connection per thread, but not immediately.
Think of it as a single PHP instance for each thread.

If you run prefork, the MPM that forks the Apache server into several
accept()ing subprocesses, you'll have one PHP instance per process.

This isn't always true as I might've missed some gotchas, but in general, do
know that a persistent can only try to be persistent.

As for grey at greywyvern dot moc: A cronjob would be a lot better suited
for this, and have it periodically update the index rather than request ~200
pages each time somebody searches, at least from what you describe it as.
===============================================================================

OK, WRT to the p* functions opening a new connection when one already exists.
It is my understanting that (under Apache anyways) this is on a per-process
basis. If you do a 'ps auxw|grep httpd' on your server you will see more than
one process. What p* does is make a p-connection on one of those processes
only, the one that actually handles your request. Chances are that when you hit
the page again it will be answered by a different process. I'm guessing if you
keep hitting reload you'll get around to the original process again and there
will be no error message or second connection open. Anyhow, this is true of all
p* functions; they open not one connection per server, but one connection per
server _process_.

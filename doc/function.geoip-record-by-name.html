===============================================================================

I know this may be obvious to some but I thought I would post it anyway to help
others. The GEOIP section of the PHP site is a bit limited in useful tips/
documentation other than the initial functions and examples.

If you are trying to get information about the specific user visiting your
site, you should use their IP address via the remote address in the GEOIP
function. In addition here are some useful bits of code to pull certain
information from the function.
<?php
# Collect a specific users GEOIP info
$info = geoip_record_by_name($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
print_r ($info);

# To get the info from one specific field
$country = $info['country_name'];
echo $country;

# To combine information from the array into a string
$info = implode("/", $info);
echo $info;
?>

Note on field in this array is NOT included, the connection speed of the user.
To find the connection speed/connection type the visitor has, you can use the
geoip_id_by_name() function. Lastly it is a good idea on whatever platform you
are using GEOIP on to make sure it's data is up-to-date. On most Linux/UNIX
systems with terminal you can use "pear update-channels" and "pecl
update-channels" commands to keep your libraries updated. This is a good idea
because GEOIP databases and country/location codes often change over time.
===============================================================================

This function returns a PHP Notice when a address can not be found.
===============================================================================

I use this additional code in my error handler class to suppress "PHP Notice"
send by the function geoip_record_by_name() in case of IP not found. No e-mails
or echo on display is welcome for this notice in development environment.

public static function Handler($errNo, $errStr, $errFile, $errLine){
   $backtrace = ErrorHandler::GetBacktrace(2);
   // detection of unwelcome  PHP Notice and its ignoring.
   if($errNo == E_NOTICE && preg_match('/^geoip_record_by_name.*Host.*not
found$/', $errStr)){
            return;
        }

The rest of normal error handler code remains.

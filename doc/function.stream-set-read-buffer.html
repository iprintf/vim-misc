stream_set_read_buffer — Set read file buffering on the given stream

说明

int stream_set_read_buffer ( resource $stream , int $buffer )

Sets the read buffer. It's the equivalent of stream_set_write_buffer(), but for
read operations.

参数

stream

    The file pointer.

buffer

    The number of bytes to buffer. If buffer is 0 then read operations are
    unbuffered. This ensures that all reads with fread() are completed before
    other processes are allowed to read from that input stream.

返回值

Returns 0 on success, or another value if the request cannot be honored.

odbc_num_rows

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

odbc_num_rows — Number of rows in a result

说明

int odbc_num_rows ( resource $result_id )

Gets the number of rows in a result. For INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements 
odbc_num_rows() returns the number of rows affected. For a SELECT clause this
can be the number of rows available.

参数

result_id

    The result identifier returned by odbc_exec().

返回值

Returns the number of rows in an ODBC result. This function will return -1 on
error.

注释

    Note:

    Using odbc_num_rows() to determine the number of rows available after a
    SELECT will return -1 with many drivers.

The easy way to count the rows in an odbc resultset where the driver returns -1
is to let SQL do the work:

<?php

    $conn = odbc_connect("dsn", "", "");
    $rs = odbc_exec($conn, "SELECT Count(*) AS counter FROM tablename WHERE
fieldname='" . $value . "'");
    $arr = odbc_fetch_array($rs);
    echo $arr['counter'];

?>
===============================================================================

None of these examples were working for me, so I came up with the following
silly procedure that gives me the number of rows.  This example is crude, but
you should get the idea.

<?php
$cxn = odbc_connect("ODBC_DSN_NAME", "", "");
$sql = "SELECT * FROM some_table'";
$res = odbc_exec($cxn, $sql);
$items = 0;
while ($row = odbc_fetch_array($res))
   {
       $items++;                          
   } 
  odbc_free_result($res);
  echo "<br>total No. of rows: $items";
?>

When accessing a DB2 database with PHP via the ODBC functions, beware of
statements which include references to IBM's LONGDESCRIPTION table (for
example, if you were - like myself - digging through IBM's Maximo product).
Reading from that table usually requires error suppression, because although it
works ODBC will spit out a warning message onscreen.

When you make it part of another query however, ODBC_NUM_ROWS will always
return -1. The solution is to keep any queries to LONGDESCRIPTION in a separate
standalone query by itself.

However, if you run the query though a previewer like Toad for DB2, using
LONGDESCRIPTION in a larger query is fine and does show the results. It's just
that you have to break the query up and segregate the query to LONGDESCRIPTION
on its own if you are writing ODBC queries for PHP.

Just a quick note for anyone else who found ODBC_NUM_RESULTS normally reliable
otherwise but inexplicably always returning -1 under certain circumstances.

I could have been noted before in this thread but I couldnt find it on my first
search.

This function (odbc_num_rows) returns -1 when ODBCing to MS SQL and making it
hard to get the number of rows in the returned recordset.

Two workarounds:
   1. When you just need to verify that any rows returned from your query you
can use select count(*) as cnt from table and then just get $row['cnt']
   2. When you need to actually loop through the records this function returns
number of rows in the recordset if and only if you include ORDER BY clause in
your query statement.

That sounds a bit annoying but thats the work around when dealing with MS SQL
odbc driver I guess.

It would be beneficial if someone explained how the Order By clause makes the
difference.
===============================================================================

The diference between functions used here are consierable, for example for one
table with 36 columns and 806 rows the time to execute two of those functions
are this:

function using odbc odbc_result_all take 2,6 seconds
function using odbc_fetch_row take 0,8 seconds

Este codigo se probó en SQL Server 2000, no se probó en otras versiones como
2005 o 2008. Aun asi no se aplica para MySQL, porque no existe la tabla
"sysindexes":

$cnx = odbc_connect("dbSQLEmpresa","Admin","123");
if ($cnx)
{
    $rs = odbc_exec($cnx, "SELECT * FROM alumnos");
    $f = odbc_num_fields($rs);
    $r = odbc_num_rows($rs);
    $r = LFRJ_odbc_num_rows($cnx,"alumnos");

    echo "<table border = '1'>";
    for ($i = 1; $i <= $f; $i++)
    {
        $n = odbc_field_name($rs, $i);
        echo "<th>", $n, "</th>";
    }
    while(odbc_fetch_row($rs))
    {
        echo "<tr>";
        for ($i = 1; $i <= $f; $i++)
        {
            $d = odbc_result($rs, $i);
            echo "<td>", $d, "</td>";
        }
        echo "</tr>";
    }
    echo "<tr><td colspan = '" . $f . "'>Campos(" . $f . ") Registros(" . $r .
")</td></tr>";
    echo "</table>";
}
odbc_close($cnx);

function LFRJ_odbc_num_rows($cnx,$Tabla) 
{
    $rs = odbc_exec($cnx, "SELECT rows FROM sysindexes WHERE id = OBJECT_ID('"
. $Tabla . "') AND indid < 2;");
    return odbc_result($rs, 1);
}

function best_odbc_num_rows($r1)  {
    ob_start(); // block printing table with results
    (int)$number=odbc_result_all($r1);
    ob_clean(); // block printing table with results
    return $number;
}

Above is the best way to count if you are not using something like IBM Netezza
and ODBC and not doing more than 100000ish records, otherwise even this method
will run out of memory.

IBM Netezza and ODBC will give you counts matching the prefetch setting in the
odbc.ini file :( the default is 256 so watch out because it is accurate until
that number.

My development computer is running XP sql2005 while the production copy sits on
a server 2003R2 sql2000 computer.

In the course of trying to get this function to work (switching from mssql to
odbc) I have discovered that the ODBC driver versions are different between the
two OS and that while the newer version (release date 17/2/07) that is able to
be installed on 2003 handles this function fine, the older version doesn't.

Microsoft sites suggest that Vista might also handle it (ie have the newer
driver). It also says that there are no plans to release the newer driver in a
installable package.

Will hopefully test with the sql2005 on server 2003R2 in the near future to
confirm it is the driver helping here.

function db_get_row($cur, $rownum){
if (odbc_fetch_into($cur, $row, $rownum)){
        return ($row);
    }else{
        return (FALSE);
}

$i=1;
if (db_get_row($cur,1)){
while ($record=db_get_row($cur,$i++)){
do stuff
}else{
tell the user there are no results
}

After minutes of frustration, I realized why odbc_num_rows was not returning
the number of affected rows on a prepared update query.  I'm using ODBC to
connect to Microsot SQL Server 2005.

My corrected code:

<?php
$query = odbc_prepare($conn, 'UPDATE table SET cat = ? WHERE id = 1');
$result = odbc_execute($query, $category);
$affected = odbc_num_rows($query);
?>

This code works.  I was frustrated that odbc_num_rows($result) didn't work as I
expected, but instead required me to pass the original prepared query to this
function.
===============================================================================

odbc_num_rows does return -1 when it shouldn't.

i used this code:

<?php
if( odbc_num_rows( $Result ) ) {
   while( false !== ( $Row = @odbc_fetch_array( $Result ) ) ) {
     // do something with $Row
   }
}
else {
   return false;
}
?>

and it didn't work... obviously

but this while loop will skip an empty result set anyway, so i use this:

<?php
while( false !== ( $Row = @odbc_fetch_array( $Result ) ) ) {
  // do something with $Row
}
if( ! odbc_num_rows( $Result ) ) {
   return false;
}
?>

because after processing the $Result with fetch, odbc_num_rows reports the
correct count (false|0..n) ... magic :-)
===============================================================================

Today we find a BEST way to count number of rows with ODBC!

function best_odbc_num_rows($r1)  {

ob_start(); // block printing table with results

(int)$number=odbc_result_all($r1);

ob_clean(); // block printing table with results

return $number;

}
===============================================================================

voland's function is simply great.
However, i would recommend the use of ob_end_clean(), to shut down completely
the output buffer (can cause weird behaviour).
===============================================================================

I just tried to use the function best_odbc_num_rows($result) from voland at
digitalshop dot ru, but it's not working quite well. After executing the
function odbc_result_all(); the resultset has to be resetted again.
Resetting it with

odbc_fetch_row($result, 0);

is not working for me.

I think the internal number-value of the odbc_result_all()-function is not
resetted, but that's just a guess.

when I execute the function 3 times with a resultset of 17 rows the values: 17,
34 and 51 are returned.

His previous function useful_odbc_num_rows($result) works better (for me).
===============================================================================

After a hour for a searching a good alter function of odbc_num_rows... i try to
write it by mysels:

function useful_odbc_num_rows($result){

   $num_rows=0;

   while($temp = odbc_fetch_into($result, &$counter))

   {
       $num_rows++;
   }

@odbc_fetch_row($result, 0);   // reset cursor

   return $num_rows;
}

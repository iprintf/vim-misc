Gmagick::quantizeimages — The quantizeimages purpose

说明

public Gmagick Gmagick::quantizeimages ( int $numColors , int $colorspace , int
$treeDepth , bool $dither , bool $measureError )

Analyzes the colors within a sequence of images and chooses a fixed number of
colors to represent the image. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the
color difference between the input and output image while minimizing the
processing time.

参数

numColors

    The number of colors.

colorspace

    Perform color reduction in this colorspace, typically RGBColorspace.

treeDepth

    Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero or one tells Quantize
    to choose a optimal tree depth of Log4(number_colors).% A tree of this
    depth generally allows the best representation of the reference image with
    the least amount of memory and the fastest computational speed. In some
    cases, such as an image with low color dispersion (a few number of colors),
    a value other than Log4(number_colors) is required. To expand the color
    tree completely, use a value of 8.

dither

    A value other than zero distributes the difference between an original
    image and the corresponding color reduced algorithm to neighboring pixels
    along a Hilbert curve.

measureError

    A value other than zero measures the difference between the original and
    quantized images. This difference is the total quantization error. The
    error is computed by summing over all pixels in an image the distance
    squared in RGB space between each reference pixel value and its quantized
    value.

返回值

The Gmagick object on success

错误／异常

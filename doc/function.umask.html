umask

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

umask — 改变当前的 umask

说明

int umask ([ int $mask ] )

umask() 将 PHP 的 umask 设定为 mask & 0777 并返回原来的 umask。当 PHP 被作为服
务器模块使用时，在每个请求结束后 umask 会被恢复。

参数

mask

    The new umask.

返回值

无参数调用 umask() 会返回当前的 umask，有参数则返回原来的 umask。

范例

Example #1 umask() 例子

<?php
$old = umask(0);
chmod("/path/some_dir/some_file.txt", 0755);
umask($old);

// Checking
if ($old != umask()) {
    die('An error occured while changing back the umask');
}
?>

注释

    Note:

    在多线程的服务器上尽量避免使用这个函数。创建文件后要改变其权限最好还是使用 
    chmod()。使用 umask() 会导致并发程序和服务器发生不可预知的情况，因为它们是
    使用相同的 umask 的。

===============================================================================

I think that the best way to understand umask is to say that umask is used to
revoke permissions, not to set permissions.

umask sets which permissions must be removed from the system default when you
create a file or a directory.

For example, a mask 0022 means that you don't want group and others modify the
file.

default 0666 rw-.rw-.rw-
umask   0022 ---.-w-.-w-
Final   0644 rw-.r--.r--

That means that any file from now on will have 0644 permissions.

It is important to understand that umask revokes, deletes permissions from
system default, so it can´t grant permissions the system default hasn't. In the
example above, with the 666 system default, there is no way you can use umask
to create a file with execute permission. If you want to grant more
permissions, use chmod.

Be aware that system default permissions are not related to PHP (they depends
upon server configuration). PHP has a default umask that is applied after
system default base permissions. And there are different system default base
permissions for files and directories.

Usually, system default permissions for files are 666 and for directories 0777.
And usually, default PHP umask is 0022
===============================================================================

"It is better to change the file permissions with chmod() after creating the
file."

The usual lacking of security knowledge within the PHP team rears its head once
again.  You *always* want to have the file created with the proper permission. 
Let me illustrate why:

(a) you create new file with read permissions
(b) an attacking script opens the file
(c) you chmod the file to remove read permissions
(d) you write sensitive data to the file

Now, you might think that the changes of an attacking script getting to open
the file before you chmod them are low.  And you're right.  But low changes are
never low enough - you want zero chance.

When creating a file that needs increased permissions, you always need to
create the file with the proper permissions, and also create it with O_EXCL
set.  If you don't do an exclusive create, you end up with this scenario:

(a) attacker creates the file, makes it writable to everyone
(b) you open the file with restricted permissions, but since it already exists,
the file is merely opened and the permissions left alone
(c) you write sensitive data into the insecure file

Detecting the latter scenario is possible, but it requires a bit of work.  You
have to check that the file's owner and group match the script's (that is,
posix_geteuid(), not myuid()) and check the permissions - if any of those are
incorrect, then the file is insecure - you can attempt to unlink() it and try
again while logging a warning, of course.

The only time when it is reasonable or safe to chmod() a file after creating it
is when you want to grant extra permissions instead of removing them.  For
example, it is completely safe to set the umask to 0077 and then chmoding the
files you create afterward.

Doing truly secure programming in PHP is difficult as is, and advice like this
in the documentation just makes things worse.  Remember, kids, anything that
applies to security in the C or UNIX worlds is 100% applicable to PHP.  The
best thing you can possibly do for yourself as a PHP programmer is to learn and
understand secure C and UNIX programming techniques.
===============================================================================

In case you don't understand why you need to "Avoid using this function in
multithreaded webservers":

It's because this function changes the umask at the process level, rather than
only for PHP or for the current script.  If there are multiple simultaneous
threads running in the process in which your PHP script is running, the change
will apply to all of those threads at the same time hence why this is not safe
for multithreaded use.

I understand that if you are using the PHP module and Apache's prefork MPM,
which is not multi-threaded, then you at least won't get race-condition
problems such as this.  However, it is still worth noting that the umask
setting, if not re-set, will persist for the life of that process even if the
process is re-used to serve future PHP or non-PHP requests.
===============================================================================

umask takes away the given values from the standard mask 777.
A graphical view shows this better:

standard:
rwxrwxrwx = 777
will get with umask 002:
rwxrwxr-x  = 775
or will get with umask 077:
rwx------ = 700

and so on.
===============================================================================

"It is better to change the file permissions with chmod() after creating the
file."

If you take that advice seriously, consider setting your umask so that files
are created private to your user, then use chmod to open them up.

<?php
// files will create as -rw-------
umask(0077);

// create a file, eg fopen()

// give access: -rw-r--r--
chmod('/path/to/file', 0644);
?>

Whenever reasonable, default to shut and open as needed (like above) instead of
default to open and shut as needed.  The above still has a race condition, but
the race condition will deny appropriate access instead of granting
inappropriate access.
===============================================================================

The first comment perhaps didn't quite make clear what's on with your umask and
the permissions.

The permission passed to a command is first bitwise ANDed with the _INVERSE_ of
the current umask, then applied to the file.

For example, umask = 0011 and permission = 0775
The inverse of 0011 = 0766

0775 AND 0766
= 111.111.101 AND 111.110.110
= 111.110.100
= 0764
===============================================================================

Clarification Of "mask & 0777":

The manual's comment "umask() sets PHP's umask to mask & 0777 [...]" is merely
implying that the method only affects file permissions, but not special modes
such as the setuid, setgid or sticky bits. Curiously, PHP does not actually
perform the bitwise operation itself, but instead assumes it will be done by a
system call of the same name. On some systems such as OS X, umask effectively
sets the umask as mask & 07777, but the extraneous bits are not applicable to
subsequent PHP calls like mkdir(). Linux's umask does use 0777. Its manual
entry has a comment similar to the PHP one, but with a parenthetical statement
that helps explain what it means:

"umask() sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to mask &
0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of mask are used) [...]"

The fact that permissions can be determined by inverting a mask using the
operation $mask & ~0777 is irrelevant, despite its similar appearance to $mask
& 0777. The latter operation instead truncates $mask to the first nine
low-order bits (i.e., the three rightmost octal digits [and note that the
leading zero for octal notation is not itself a digit]). It does not change the
remaining bits.

For example, all of the following calls have the same effect: umask(0022),
umask(07022), umask(261650) (decimal value of 0777022), and umask
(0b111000010010) (binary notation for 07022).
===============================================================================

It is important to note that the mask parameter will accept values other than
octal and that this can cause unexpected results.

Setting umask(22) could be expected to reduce a file with default 0666
permission to 0644 by applying a mask of 0022 but as the parameter is being
supplied as a decimal it will be converted to octal silently and actually apply
a mask of 0026 resulting in a final file permission of 0642.

Similarly the value returned by umask is in decimal format. If you correctly
apply a mask using umask(0022) and then query the new setting with umask() it
will return a value of 18 (0022 octal is 18 decimal).

In short, when applying permissions it is best to pad the supplied value with
zeros to create an octal value (22 becomes 0022) and if you want to analyze the
returned value remember to convert it to octal for ease of interpretation.
===============================================================================

You can use umask to solve the PHP session bug that appears in several PHP
versions.

<?php
umask(0022);
session_start();
?>

This will prevent sessions being created with inadequate permissions.
===============================================================================

On most UNIX environments the recommended default umask for files, defined in /
home/user/.profile or /etc/profile, is 022 (chmod: 644). On trusted systems it
is 002. Exercise caution when applying more liberal settings.
===============================================================================

Using (cmask - umask) is a wrong way to calculate the new mask:

0022 - 0700 = 0656 WRONG
0700 & ~0022 = 0700 CORRECT

Correct php code:
<?php
$rmask = ($cmask & ~$umask);
?>
===============================================================================

To play around with umasks and permissions use this little fragment:

<?
$umask = 0012;
$perm  = 0777;
printf("umask: %04o perm: %04o result: %04o\n",
       $umask,$perm,$perm & (0777 - $umask));
?>
===============================================================================

Notice that directory(s) and file(s) sometimes have different results.

<?php
umask(0670);                    //- set umask
$handle = fopen('file', 'w');   //- 0006
mkdir("/path/dir");             //- 0107
?>

calculate the result:
<?php
$umask = 0670;
umask($umask);
//- if you are creating a new directory, $permission = 0777;
//- if you are creating a new file, $permission = 0666.
printf( "result: %04o", $permission & ( 0777 - $umask) );
?>

BTW, as the manual said, the form of umask() is "int umask ( [int mask] )", so
if you want to print/echo any umask, don't forget to convert it from DEC
(because it returns a "int") to OCT.

<?php
$umask = umask();          //- returns the current umask, which is a "int"
$umask = decoct($umask);   //- Now, $umask is a "string"
echo $umask;
?>

Don't forget that the argument(parameter) is a "int", too.

<?php
umask(777);    //- WRONG! Even though you maybe use "umask 777" in some OS.
umask(0777);   //- OK
?>

If there was any mistake, please correct my statement.

ftell

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ftell — 返回文件指针读/写的位置

说明

int ftell ( resource $handle )

返回由 handle 指定的文件指针的位置，也就是文件流中的偏移量。

参数

handle

    文件指针必须是有效的，且必须指向一个通过 fopen() 或 popen() 成功打开的文件
    。在附加模式（加参数 "a" 打开文件）中 ftell() 会返回未定义错误。

返回值

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by handle as an integer;
i.e., its offset into the file stream.

如果出错，返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 ftell() 例子

<?php

// opens a file and read some data
$fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
$data = fgets($fp, 12);

// where are we ?
echo ftell($fp); // 11

fclose($fp);

?>

===============================================================================

When opening a file to append via fopen('file','ab') the file pointer should be
at the end of the file. However ftell() returns int(0) even if the file is not
empty and even after writing some text into the file.
===============================================================================

Attention! If you open a file with the "text"-modifier (e.g. 'rt') and the file
contains \r\n as line-endings, ftell() returns the position as if there were
only \n as line-endings.

Example:
If the first line only contains 1 char followed by \r\n, the start of the
second line should be position 3. (1char + \r + \n = 3 bytes) But ftell() will
return 2 - ignoring one byte. If you call ftell() in line 3, the value will
differ from the real value by 2 bytes. The error gets greater with every line.

(Watched this behavior in PHP 5.0.4 for Windows.)

BUT: fseek() works as expected - using the true byte values.
===============================================================================

When opening a file for reading and writing via fopen('file','a+') the file
pointer should be at the end of the file. However ftell() returns int(0) even
if the file is not empty. Also it seems that there is two pointers, first for
reading and second for writing, because it acts differently on first operation
(reading or writing).

Example:
<?php
$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'w');
fwrite($file, '123456789');
fclose($file);

$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'r');
echo ftell($file) . ' "' . fgets($file) . '" ' . ftell($file) . PHP_EOL;
fclose($file);

$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'a+');
echo ftell($file) . ' "' . fgets($file) . '" ' . ftell($file) . PHP_EOL;
fclose($file);

$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'r+');
fwrite($file, 'rr');
echo ftell($file) . ' "' . fgets($file) . '" ' . ftell($file) . PHP_EOL;
fclose($file);

$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'a+');
fwrite($file, 'aa');
echo ftell($file) . ' "' . fgets($file) . '" ' . ftell($file) . PHP_EOL;
fclose($file);

$file = fopen('counter.txt', 'r');
echo ftell($file) . ' "' . fgets($file) . '" ' . ftell($file) . PHP_EOL;
fclose($file);
?>

Result:
0 "123456789" 9
0 "123456789" 9
2 "3456789" 9
2 "" 2
0 "rr3456789aa" 11
===============================================================================

In response to php at michielvleugel dot com:

This does not seem to be the case with PHP 5.2.0 and FreeBSD 5.4.

#!/usr/local/bin/php
<?php
$tell = ftell(STDIN);
var_dump($tell);
?>

root@localhost:/home/david# echo Hello World | ./test.php
int(0)
root@localhost:/home/david# ./test.php
int(6629927)

When something is piped to the script, it returns an integer value of 0,
however, it also returns an integer when nothing is piped to the script.

The code should  be modified to this:

#!/usr/local/bin/php
<?php
$tell = ftell(STDIN);

if ($tell === 0)
    echo "Something was piped: " . fread(STDIN,256) . "\n";
else
    echo "Nothing was piped\n";
?>

And the result is:

root@localhost:/home/david# echo Hello World | ./test.php
Something was piped: Hello World
root@localhost:/home/david# ./test.php
Nothing was piped
===============================================================================

Actually, ftell() gives more than an undefined result for append only streams;
it gives the offset from the end of the file as defined before any data was
appended. So if you open a file that had 3017 characters, and append 41
characters, and then execute ftell(), the value returned will be 41.
===============================================================================

When trying to determine whether or not something was piped into a command line
script, it is not smart to do a fgets(STDIN), because it will wait indefenitely
if nothing is piped. Instead, I found ftell on STDIN to be very handy: it will
return an integer of zero when something was piped, and nothing if nothing was
piped to the script.

#!/usr/bin/php4 -q
<?
#following will hang if nothing is piped:
#$sometext = fgets(STDIN, 256)

$tell = ftell(STDIN);

if (is_integer($tell)==true)
  {echo "Something was piped: ".fread(STDIN,256)."\n";}
else
  {echo "Nothing was piped\n";}

?>

mysqli_fetch_all

(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0, PHP 7)

mysqli_result::fetch_all -- mysqli_fetch_all — Fetches all result rows as an
associative array, a numeric array, or both

说明

面向对象风格

mixed mysqli_result::fetch_all ([ int $resulttype = MYSQLI_NUM ] )

过程化风格

mixed mysqli_fetch_all ( mysqli_result $result [, int $resulttype = MYSQLI_NUM
] )

mysqli_fetch_all() fetches all result rows and returns the result set as an
associative array, a numeric array, or both.

参数

result

    仅以过程化样式：由 mysqli_query()，mysqli_store_result() 或 
    mysqli_use_result()返回的结果集标识。

resulttype

    This optional parameter is a constant indicating what type of array should
    be produced from the current row data. The possible values for this
    parameter are the constants MYSQLI_ASSOC, MYSQLI_NUM, or MYSQLI_BOTH.

返回值

Returns an array of associative or numeric arrays holding result rows.

仅 MySQL 原生驱动

仅可用于 mysqlnd。

As mysqli_fetch_all() returns all the rows as an array in a single step, it may
consume more memory than some similar functions such as mysqli_fetch_array(),
which only returns one row at a time from the result set. Further, if you need
to iterate over the result set, you will need a looping construct that will
further impact performance. For these reasons mysqli_fetch_all() should only be
used in those situations where the fetched result set will be sent to another
layer for processing.

===============================================================================

I tested using "fetch all" versus "while / fetch array" and :

fetch-all uses less memory (but not for so much).

In my case (test1 and test2): 147008,262848 bytes (fetch-all) versus
147112,262888 bytes (fetch-array & while.

So, about the memory, in both cases are the same.

However, about the performance
My test takes :350ms (worst case) using fetch-all, while it takes 464ms (worst
case) using fetch-array, or about 35% worst using fetch array and a while
cycle.

So, using fetch-all, for a normal code that returns a moderate amount of
information is :
a) cleaner (a single line of code)
b) uses less memory (about 0.01% less)
c) faster.

===============================================================================

If you really need this function, you can just extend the mysqli_result class
with a function like this one.

<?php
        public function fetch_all($resulttype = MYSQLI_NUM)
        {
            if (method_exists('mysqli_result', 'fetch_all')) # Compatibility
layer with PHP < 5.3
                $res = parent::fetch_all($resulttype);
            else
                for ($res = array(); $tmp = $this->fetch_array($resulttype);) 
$res[] = $tmp;

            return $res;
        }
?>
===============================================================================

It should be noted that this function only works with the mysqlnd package.

With that being said mysqlnd has proven to be very unstable, from experience,
which may end up cause php to segfault, unexpectedly.

If you are getting segfaults, you should try using some other mysql package and
use mysqli_fetch_row instead.
===============================================================================

Return value changed in 5.3.3 - between 5.3.0 and 5.3.2 (incl.) when the result
set was empty NULL was returned. 5.3.3+ returns an empty array.
Also, mysqli_fetch_all works only for buffered result sets, which are the
default for mysqli_query. MYSQLI_USE_RESULT will be supported in 5.3.4+
However, it makes little sense to use it this way, materialising unbuffered
sets. In this case choose STORE_RESULT, and fetch_all won't copy the data, but
reference it, as it is stored already in mysqlnd.
===============================================================================

If you get an empty set after calling fetch_all(), make sure the result set
cursor is reset to the beginning
===============================================================================

If you are getting the following error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method mysqli_result::fetch_all()

Be sure you didn't miss this line after the procedural call about it requiring
mysqlnd

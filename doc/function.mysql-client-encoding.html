mysql_client_encoding

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)

mysql_client_encoding — 返回字符集的名称

说明

string mysql_client_encoding ([ resource $link_identifier ] )

从 MySQL 中取得 character_set 变量的值。

参数

link_identifier

    MySQL 连接。如不指定连接标识，则使用由 mysql_connect() 最近打开的连接。如果
    没有找到该连接，会尝试不带参数调用 mysql_connect() 来创建。如没有找到连接或
    无法建立连接，则会生成 E_WARNING 级别的错误。

返回值

返回当前连接的默认字符集名称。

范例

Example #1 mysql_client_encoding() 例子

<?php
$link    = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
$charset = mysql_client_encoding($link);

echo "The current character set is: $charset\n";
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

The current character set is: latin1

I couldn't get any luck with all the stuff mentioned below, and despite having
an unicode DB, and setting all my field to utf8_general_ci...
After looking around, I found that this page: http://dev.mysql.com/
tech-resources/articles/4.1/unicode.html was adding the fields with an extra
info before each value:

<?
mysql_query("INSERT INTO table SET field = _utf8'value'");
?>
Mind the "_utf8" before the field value, and outside of the quotes.

This works for me wether in an Insert or an Update statement.

No need here for a <? mysql_query("SET NAMES utf8"); ?> before each query, or
to change anything in the config files (that was important since I don't have
access to these).
===============================================================================

Notice the difference between following two SQL statements:

SET NAMES 'charset_name'
SET CHARACTER SET charset_name

For more detail see
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Charset-connection.html
===============================================================================

f you think "set names utf8" for each connection is too trouble, you can modify
my.cnf of MySQL to solve the problem forever. In my.cnf, add the line
"default-character-set=utf8" in both [mysqld] and [client] sections:

[client]
default-character-set=utf8

[mysqld]
default-character-set=utf8

The MySQL will use utf8 after you restart it.
===============================================================================

I use mysql 3.23 and none of the above worked for me. Looking at http://
dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/4.1/unicode.html as advised by romain at
dardour dot com, I tried to include the following header in my php scripts, and
all the funy characters disapeared. Hope it will help.

<?php header("Content-type: text/html; charset=latin1");?>

(my mysql character was latin1)
===============================================================================

All I had to do to save utf8 data with php mysql_query() was to go to the
php.ini and put default_charset = "utf-8". Without this I had the same problems
some of you have. Plus, all my mysql charsets vars are in 'utf8'. (Changed them
with Mysql Admin Tool)

Didnt use any mysql SET **** command at all.

Mysql 4.1.20
PHP 4.4.4
Win XP

Hope this help some of you.
===============================================================================

If you set the encoding in my.cnf like

[mysqld]
init_connect='SET NAMES utf8'

note that the content of init_connect  is not executed for users that have the
SUPER privilege - ie root!
===============================================================================

I have had problems with encoding after export of tables (from hosting - via
PhpMyAdmin) and import them to other machine (my notebook - via PhpMyAdmin
too). In PhpMyAdmin the encoding of all data was shown correctly, not that good
with the web pages (data pulled via php).
The first point is indication, that the data was imported correctly, but php
script has got other character set than MySql is sending.

The script's character set is set in header: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-2">. MySql setting was latin1.

Then following code helped me:

<?php
mysql_query("SET CHARACTER SET 'latin2'", $conn);
?>
===============================================================================

Please note that even if you set the charset by issuing the two mentioned SQL
statements (set names, set character set) mysql_client_encoding still deliveres
the old result.

Default for me is latin1. After switching to UTF8 mysql_client_encoding still
returns latin1. The charset switched to UTF8 successfully, though.
===============================================================================

There's no 'character_set' variable available in MySQL. You can check it
yourself in MySQL online documentation or by running MySQL query "SHOW
VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set%';".
This must be an error in PHP manual, unless I'm missing something.
===============================================================================

A very easy way to always get results in UTF-8 is to make a common function to
connect to DB and in that function set character set to utf-8.

function OpenConn() {
  global $link;
  $link = mysql_connect ("localhost", "username", "password")
      or die(sendError('Could not connect to DB'));
  mysql_select_db ("dbName");
  //
  // Set character set to UTF-8
  //
  mysql_query("SET CHARACTER SET 'utf8'", $link);
}
===============================================================================

The right lines to put in /etc/my.cnf (or other MySQL options file) are:

[client]
init-command="SET NAMES utf8"

Unfortuantely the PHP mysql_connect() function does not use MySQL options files
so this is not a sollution for changing the default connection character set
for mysqlclient library v4.1+.

The only working sollution remains:

mysql_query("SET NAMES utf8", $conn);

(of course /ext/mysql/php_mysql.c can always be patched ;] )
===============================================================================

If you experience weird problems, like some UTF-8 characters (the Unicode
character &#x010D and a few others in my case) seemingly being changed to
garbage by mysql_query, you may need to do something like this before your
actual query:

<?php
mysql_query("SET NAMES 'utf8'", $conn);
?>

Took me days to figure that one out...
===============================================================================

the above (as it seems to be vaguely indicated in the mysql manual) works only
with mysql 4.1+

EventBuffer::read — Read data from an evbuffer and drain the bytes read

说明

public string EventBuffer::read ( int $max_bytes )

Read the first max_bytes from the buffer and drain the bytes read. If more
max_bytes are requested than are available in the buffer, it only extracts as
many bytes as available.

    Maxmimum number of bytes to read from the buffer.

返回值

Returns string read, or FALSE on failure.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      Renamed EventBuffer::read()(the old method name) to EventBuffer::read(). 
1.6.0 EventBuffer::read() now takes only max_bytes argument; returns string
      instead of integer.

MongoCursor::slaveOkay

(PECL mongo >=0.9.4)

MongoCursor::slaveOkay — Sets whether this query can be done on a secondary
[deprecated]

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::slaveOkay ([ bool $okay = true ] )
Warning

This method is deprecated since version 1.5.0. Instead, please use 
MongoCursor::setReadPreference() and 读取首选项.

Calling this will make the driver route reads to secondaries if:

  • You are using a replica set, and
  • You created a MongoClient instance using the option "replicaSet" =>
    "setName", and
  • There is a healthy secondary that can be reached by the driver.

You can check which server was used for this query by calling MongoCursor::info
() after running the query. It's server field will show which server the query
was sent to.

Note that you should use this function even if you do not use the automatic
routing to secondaries. If you connect directly to a secondary in a replica
set, you still need to call this function, which basically tells the database
that you are aware that you might be getting older data and you're okay with
that. If you do not call this, you'll get "not master" errors when you try to
query.

This method will override the static class variable MongoCursor::$slaveOkay. It
will also override Mongo::setSlaveOkay(), MongoDB::setSlaveOkay() and 
MongoCollection::setSlaveOkay().

参数

okay

    If it is okay to query the secondary.

返回值

Returns this cursor.

错误／异常

Throws MongoCursorException if this cursor has started iterating.

范例

Example #1 MongoCursor::slaveOkay() example

<?php

MongoCursor::$slaveOkay = false;

// cannot query secondary
$cursor = $collection->find();

// can query secondary
$cursor = $collection->find()->slaveOkay();

MongoCursor::$slaveOkay = true;

// can query secondary
$cursor = $collection->find();

// cannot query secondary
$cursor = $collection->find()->slaveOkay(false);

?>

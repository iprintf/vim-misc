Imagick::paintTransparentImage

(PECL imagick 2.0.0)

Imagick::paintTransparentImage — Changes any pixel that matches color with the
color defined by fill

说明

bool Imagick::paintTransparentImage ( mixed $target , float $alpha , float
$fuzz )

Changes any pixel that matches color with the color defined by fill.

参数

target

    Change this target color to specified opacity value within the image.

alpha

    The level of transparency: 1.0 is fully opaque and 0.0 is fully
    transparent.

fuzz

    The fuzz member of image defines how much tolerance is acceptable to
    consider two colors as the same.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE。

错误／异常

错误时抛出 ImagickException。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
2.1.0 Now allows a string representing the color as the first parameter.
      Previous versions allow only an ImagickPixel object.

Actually it does seem to work just not the way expected perhaps.

Looking at the fuzz option on ImageMagick's site (http://www.imagemagick.org/
script/command-line-options.php#fuzz), "The distance can be in absolute
intensity units or, by appending % as a percentage of the maximum possible
intensity (255, 65535, or 4294967295)."

As it requires a float, the percentage value won't work so it actually one of
the max intensity values.  In my case, the images I was working with seemed to
have max intensity values of 65535.  So a fuzz of 6500, for roughly 10%, seemed
to do the trick.

The part that might be problematic though is how do you determine the max
intensity of a color/image?  Using a static 6500 would be fine until I would
have to convert an image with a max intensity other than 65535.  If it's 255 it
would wipe the entire image.  Or fall far short on the fuzz with the larger
value.
===============================================================================

Have a look at this thread on Stackoverflow for the answer regarding how to
determine the max intensity of an image.

In short here is the code to make the $fuzz parameter behave more like you
would expect (it now represents a percentage between 0-100). The $fuzz value
should now be a float between 0 and 1.

class SaneImagick extends Imagick
{
    public function paintTransparentImage($target, $alpha, $fuzz)
    {
        $iQuantumDepth = pow(2, $this->getQuantumDepth()['quantumDepthLong']);
        return parent::paintTransparentImage($target, $alpha, $fuzz *
$iQuantumDepth);
    }
}
===============================================================================

The fuzz is just working well in a range of 0 to 65535.

I suggest you to try to move fuzz on a color spectrum image.

1/ Get a color spectrum ( Google Image has a lot )

2/ Try this code :

<?php

    function fuzzTest($source, $target, $fuzz) {

        // Loads image
        $im = new Imagick($source);

        // Resizes images to make them easily comparable
        $im->resizeImage(320, 240, Imagick::FILTER_LANCZOS, 1, true);
       
        // Apply fuzz
        $im->paintTransparentImage($im->getImagePixelColor(0, 0), 0, $fuzz);
       
         // Writes image
        $im->setImageFormat('png');
        $im->writeImage($target);
        $im->destroy();
        
        return true;
     }

     for ($i = 0; ($i <= 10); $i++) {
         fuzzTest('spectrum.png', "test_{$i}.png", (6553.5 * $i));
         echo '<img src="test_' . $i . '.png" />&nbsp;';
     }

?>

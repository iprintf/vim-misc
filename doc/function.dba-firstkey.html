I wondered why it wasn't already written, so I did because I think working with
associative arrays is always as comfortable as can be

<?php
function dba_fetch_assoc($handle) {
    $assoc = array();
    for($k = dba_firstkey($handle); $k != false; $k = dba_nextkey($handle)) {
        $assoc[$k] = dba_fetch($k, $handle);
    }
    return $assoc;
}
?>

Looks like Jacky is using some DB object? I don't know if it's native to PHP or
written on it's own... Anyways this is what I use:

$DBCon = dba_open("/tmp/test_db.db2", "r", "db2") or die("Uh oh, can't open the
database :(");
if ($the_key = dba_firstkey($DBCon)) do {
    print("Key: $the_key    Value:");
    print dba_fetch($the_key, $DBCon);
    print("<BR>");
} while ($the_key = dba_nextkey($DBCon));
print ("<BR><BR><BR>Well looks like we're done here :-)");
===============================================================================

for ($key = dba_firstkey($this->handle); $key !== false; $key = dba_nextkey
($this->handle)) {
            $keyset[] = $key;
        } // end for

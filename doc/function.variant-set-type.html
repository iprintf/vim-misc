===============================================================================

In my application I was using ADODB to retrieve data from Microsoft Access. 
During queries, fields defined as "Date/Time" in Access were being returned to
PHP as instances of the Variant class.

For some reason, the variant_date_to_timestamp function returned incorrect
timestamps.  As a workaround, I used variant_set_type($variant, VT_BSTR) to get
a string representation of the date.  This can be used for most variant types
PHP doesn't handle.
===============================================================================

I need to pass VT_ARRAY | VT_BSTR | VT_BYREF in COM method but i haven't any
idea how can do this.

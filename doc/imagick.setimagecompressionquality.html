I had strange results when trying to get good png compression.

I used Imagick::COMPRESSION_ZIP

Here are a few file sizes for a few compression levels.

0: 236,100
1: 274,035
9: 258,379
50: 241,282
100: 240,156

Note the best result at 0. Also I got thrown off for a long time trying to get
similar results to gimp. Make sure your image depth is set to 8, it appears to
be 16 bits per channel, at least for me.

You can check with identify -verbose filename.png

You can also strip a bit more file size with $image->stripImage();
===============================================================================

This example shows how to set the compression type, set the compression
quality, create a thumbnail and remove unnecessary data in order to reduce file
size.

This will use the following functions in reference:
Imagick::setImageCompression
Imagick::setImageCompressionQuality
Imagick::stripImage
Imagick::thumbnailImage
Imagick::writeImage

<?php
    $image = 'image.jpg';
    $directory = '/path/to/image';
    $image_location = $directory . "/" . $image;
    $thumb_destination = $directory . "/t" . $image;
    $compression_type = Imagick::COMPRESSION_JPEG;
  
    $im = new Imagick($image_location);
    $thumbnail = $im->clone;

    $thumbnail->setImageCompression($compression_type);
    $thumbnail->setImageCompressionQuality(40);
    $thumbnail->stripImage();
    $thumbnail->thumbnailImage(100,null);
    $thumbnail->writeImage($thumb_destination);
?>

Now, obviously you don't have to do so much with the variables and the file
location.  I only used so many to demonstrate where the images are coming from
and where they are going.

NOTE:  The $thumbnail->thumbnailImage(100,null); keeps the aspect ration by
setting the second parameter to null.  Read about this at
Imagick::thumbnailImage

There is another way to create thumbnails that works quite well if you want to
crop the image rather than using the entire image.  Check out
Imagick::cropThumbnailImage
===============================================================================

The default value fot the JPEG compression quality appears to be 86.

Here is an example of Query to retrieve the records from MangoDB collection
using a filter. It will return in this case just one record that satisfy the
filter id = 2.

Considering the following MangoDB collection:

<?php
/* my_collection */

/* 1 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5707f007639a94cbc600f282"),
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "Name 1"
}

/* 2 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5707f0a8639a94f4cd2c84b1"),
    "id" : 2,
    "name" : "Name 2"
}
?>

I'm using the following code:
<?php
$filter = ['id' => 2];
$options = [
   'projection' => ['_id' => 0],
];
$query = new MongoDB\Driver\Query($filter, $options);
$rows = $mongo->executeQuery('db_name.my_collection', $query); // $mongo
contains the connection object to MongoDB
foreach($rows as $r){
   print_($r);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Careful with your filter here - integers and strings are different.

With a string ID '1000', this query will mysteriously return 0 results; wasted
time figuring out what was going on:

$query = new MongoDB\Driver\Query(['_id' => 1000]);

This will work:

$query = new MongoDB\Driver\Query(['_id' => '1000']);

Would be nice if the library could handle this.

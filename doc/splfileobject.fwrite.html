===============================================================================

Your \SplFileObject will not throw an exception when trying to write to a
non-writeable stream!

I forgot to set the second parameter on my \SplFileObject constructor (the
mode), costing me minutes to figure out why nothing was writter by the fwrite
method...

Just to let you know!

imap_getmailboxes

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

imap_getmailboxes — Read the list of mailboxes, returning detailed information
on each one

说明

array imap_getmailboxes ( resource $imap_stream , string $ref , string $pattern
)

Gets information on the mailboxes.

参数

imap_stream

    由 imap_open() 返回的 IMAP 流。

ref

    ref should normally be just the server specification as described in 
    imap_open()

pattern

    指定在邮箱层级的何处开始查找。

    在组成 pattern 的字符中可使用两个特殊字符： '*' 和 '%'。 '*' 是指返回所有邮
    箱目录. 如果将 '*' 作为 pattern 参数时, 则会返回整个邮箱层级结构。 '%' 是指
    只返回当前级次。 '%' 作为 pattern 参数则只会返回顶层邮箱； '~/mail/%' 用于
    UW_IMAPD 则会返回名为 ~/mail 的目录, 但不包含其子目录。

返回值

Returns an array of objects containing mailbox information. Each object has the
attributes name, specifying the full name of the mailbox; delimiter, which is
the hierarchy delimiter for the part of the hierarchy this mailbox is in; and
attributes. Attributes is a bitmask that can be tested against:

  • LATT_NOINFERIORS - This mailbox contains, and may not contain any
    "children" (there are no mailboxes below this one). Calling 
    imap_createmailbox() will not work on this mailbox.

  • LATT_NOSELECT - This is only a container, not a mailbox - you cannot open
    it.

  • LATT_MARKED - This mailbox is marked. This means that it may contain new
    messages since the last time it was checked. Not provided by all IMAP
    servers.

  • LATT_UNMARKED - This mailbox is not marked, does not contain new messages.
    If either MARKED or UNMARKED is provided, you can assume the IMAP server
    supports this feature for this mailbox.

范例

Example #1 imap_getmailboxes() example

<?php
$mbox = imap_open("{imap.example.org}", "username", "password", OP_HALFOPEN)
      or die("can't connect: " . imap_last_error());

$list = imap_getmailboxes($mbox, "{imap.example.org}", "*");
if (is_array($list)) {
    foreach ($list as $key => $val) {
        echo "($key) ";
        echo imap_utf7_decode($val->name) . ",";
        echo "'" . $val->delimiter . "',";
        echo $val->attributes . "<br />\n";
    }
} else {
    echo "imap_getmailboxes failed: " . imap_last_error() . "\n";
}

imap_close($mbox);
?>

i am currently develop a simple IMAP client, when i call imap_getmailboxes() i
receive a different values in attributes property of the mailbox object the
problem is how can i manipulate these attributes to get a meaningful value,
if you make a hard search to find a solution for this, you will
not find any useful documents for this problem, let us take a closer look for
this problem.

when i call imap_getmailboxes() against different IMAP servers i got these
attribute values

[attributes] => 9
[attributes] => 1
[attributes] => 64
[attributes] => 32
[attributes] => 40

the documentation tell us that we check this attributes against four constants,
these contents are

LATT_NOINFERIORS
LATT_NOSELECT
LATT_MARKED
LATT_UNMARKED

the value of these constants are

LATT_NOINFERIORS = 1
LATT_NOSELECT = 2
LATT_MARKED = 4
LATT_UNMARKED = 8

you can got this result by echo each constant, unfortunately the documentation
not explain how we can check the attributes against the constants, after a long
time of searching i find the answer in source code of c-client
(you can get the source from ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/)
under \src\c-client you will find mail.h open it and you will find this

                               /* terminal node in hierarchy */
#define LATT_NOINFERIORS (long) 0x1
                /* name can not be selected */
#define LATT_NOSELECT (long) 0x2
                /* changed since last accessed */
#define LATT_MARKED (long) 0x4
                /* accessed since last changed */
#define LATT_UNMARKED (long) 0x8
                /* name has referral to remote mailbox */
#define LATT_REFERRAL (long) 0x10
                /* has selectable inferiors */
#define LATT_HASCHILDREN (long) 0x20
                /* has no selectable inferiors */
#define LATT_HASNOCHILDREN (long) 0x40

as you notice here these are our four constants and three additional constants

LATT_REFERRAL
LATT_HASCHILDREN
LATT_HASNOCHILDREN

then what is the value of these 3 attributes
LATT_REFERRAL 0x10 = 00010000 in binary, the bitmask value is 2^4 = 16 and so
on, or simply echo this constant to get the value, then

LATT_REFERRAL = 16
LATT_HASCHILDREN = 32
LATT_HASNOCHILDREN = 64

finally the full list of constants will be
LATT_NOINFERIORS = 1
LATT_NOSELECT = 2
LATT_MARKED = 4
LATT_UNMARKED = 8
LATT_REFERRAL = 16
LATT_HASCHILDREN = 32
LATT_HASNOCHILDREN = 64

ok let's back to our attributes
[attributes] => 9
[attributes] => 1
[attributes] => 64
[attributes] => 32
[attributes] => 40

[attributes] => 9 this mean it's LATT_UNMARKED and LATT_NOINFERIORS 1+8 =9

[attributes] => 1 this mean LATT_NOINFERIORS

[attributes] => 64 this mean LATT_HASNOCHILDREN

[attributes] => 32 this mean LATT_HASCHILDREN

[attributes] => 40 this mean LATT_HASCHILDREN and LATT_UNMARKED 32+8=40

this just like linux file permission 7 mean read, write, and execute 4+2+1 read
=4 write=2 execute=1

that is what i found, i hope this can help

The list of mailbox attributes in this document is very misleading. In
particular the explanation of noinferiors is just wrong. It does not mean that
the mailbox currently has no children, it means that it *cannot* have children
ever. Also, it is untrue that marked and unmarked are only used by UW-IMAP.
They are in the official IMAP specification and are used by at least
Courier-imap as well.

One thing to watch out for, however, is broken IMAP servers which do send \
Noinferiors when they mean that there are currently no children.

From the IMAP4rev1 specs (RFC 2060):
      \Noinferiors

         It is not possible for any child levels of hierarchy to exist
         under this name; no child levels exist now and none can be
         created in the future.

      \Noselect

         It is not possible to use this name as a selectable mailbox.

      \Marked

         The mailbox has been marked "interesting" by the server; the
         mailbox probably contains messages that have been added since
         the last time the mailbox was selected.

      \Unmarked

         The mailbox does not contain any additional messages since the
         last time the mailbox was selected.
===============================================================================

In case you print_r() or var_dump() the object and see an int for attribute,
these are the constant integers for the bitmask.

1 LATT_NOINFERIORS
2 LATT_NOSELECT
4 LATT_MARKED
8 LATT_UNMARKED

i was looking for a function to test the attributes.
and it was hard to find an answer or code.

Maybe there is a function availeble, but i couldn't find it.

the first function: returns all mailboxes in on the server

The second function: returns a bitstring from the attr_number returned by
getmailboxes()

The tirth function: returns an array with the active attributes on the specific
mailbox

Last Line: is a combination of the functions: the output is, any map witch can
hold no mail but only sub boxes...

<?php
function getFolders($mailbox, $serverString) {

    $list = imap_getmailboxes($mailbox, $serverString, "*");
    if (is_array($list)) {
        foreach ($list as $key => $val) {
           $mapname = str_replace($serverString, "", imap_utf7_decode($val->
name));
           if ($mapname[0] != ".") {
               $list_folders[$key]['name'] = $mapname;
               $list_folders[$key]['delimiter'] = $val->delimiter;
               $list_folders[$key]['attributes'] = $val->attributes;
           }
           
        }
    } else {
        echo "imap_getmailboxes failed: " . imap_last_error() . "\n";
    }

    return $list_folders;
}

function IntToBin($number) {
    $BitWaarde = 1;
    $IntNum = $number;
    $BinString = "";

    if ($IntNum > 0) {
    
        // bepaal de max bitwaarde aan de hand van $IntNum
        while ($IntNum > $BitWaarde) {
            $BitWaarde = $BitWaarde * 2;
        }
    
    
    
        // maken van een binaire string.
        while ($BitWaarde >= 1 ) {
            if ($IntNum < $BitWaarde) {
                if ($BinString != "") $BinString .= "0";
            } else {
                $BinString .= "1";
                $IntNum = $IntNum-$BitWaarde;
            }
            $BitWaarde = $BitWaarde / 2;
        }
   
    }
   
   
    return $BinString;
}

function Attributes($BinString) {

    $BinInt = (int)$BinString;
    if ($BinInt >=1000){
        $setAttribute['LATT_UNMARKED'] = true;
        $BinInt = $BinInt-1000;
    } else $setAttribute['LATT_UNMARKED'] = false;

    if ($BinInt >=100){
        $setAttribute['LATT_MARKED'] = true;
        $BinInt = $BinInt-100;
    } else $setAttribute['LATT_MARKED'] = false;
   
    if ($BinInt >=10){
        $setAttribute['LATT_NOSELECT'] = true;
        $BinInt = $BinInt-10;
    } else $setAttribute['LATT_NOSELECT'] = false;

        $BinInt = $BinInt-1;
    } else $setAttribute['LATT_NOINFERIORS'] = false;

    return $setAttribute;
}

foreach (getFolders($mailbox, $config['Server_string']) as $key => $val) {
                        $Attr = Attributes(IntToBin((int)$val['attributes']));
                        if (!$Attr['LATT_NOINFERIORS']) {

For the purposes of passing along the attributes as a json array, I wanted to
pass the attributes as an indexed array to save on bandwidth and session
storage.  The human readable translation is then performed in javascript by
relating each key to the proper attribute label.  I also wanted a cleaner way
of converting the attributes without calling another function or using a
complex iteration. This puts each binary attribute into it's own array element
for easy testing.

<?php
$mailboxes = imap_getmailboxes($mailbox, $username, $password);

foreach($mailboxes as $key=>$mailbox){
   ...
   $attrs =  preg_split('//',str_pad(decbin($mailbox->attributes),7,"0",
STR_PAD_LEFT),8);  // convert decimal to an array of attributes
   array_shift($attrs); // Remove the extra element at the front of the array
in position 0
   ...
}
?>

With temporary variables, the conversion would look like this.

<?php
$attr_binary = decbin($mailbox->attributes);  // convert decimal to binary
$attr_binary = str_pad($attr_binary,7,"0",STR_PAD_LEFT);  // pad with 0's on
the left
$attrs = $preg_split('//',$attr_binary,8);  // split into an array after each
character
array_shift($attrs);  // Remove the extra element at the front of the array in
position 0
?>

By defining the attributes as a map to the array index, you can test as
follows.

<?php
define("ATTR_NOINFERIORS",6);
define("ATTR_NOSELECT "5);
define("ATTR_MARKED ",4);
define("ATTR_UNMARKED ",3);
define("ATTR_REFERRAL ",2);
define("ATTR_HASCHILDREN ",1);
define("ATTR_HASNOCHILDREN ",0);

if ($attrs[ATTR_HASCHILDREN]){
// do something
}
?>

EventHttpRequest::getConnection — Returns EventHttpConnection object

说明

public EventHttpConnection EventHttpRequest::closeConnection ( void )

Returns EventHttpConnection object which represents HTTP connection associated
with the request.

Warning

Libevent API allows HTTP request objects to be not bound to any HTTP
connection. Therefore we can't unambiguously associate EventHttpRequest with
EventHttpConnection . Thus, we construct EventHttpConnection object on-the-fly.
Having no information about the event base, DNS base and connection-close
callback, we just leave these fields unset.

EventHttpRequest::getConnection() method is usually useful when we need to set
up a callback on connection close. See EventHttpConnection::setCloseCallback()
.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

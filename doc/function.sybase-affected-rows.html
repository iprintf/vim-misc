sybase_affected_rows — Gets number of affected rows in last query

说明

int sybase_affected_rows ([ resource $link_identifier ] )

sybase_affected_rows() returns the number of rows affected by the last INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE query on the server associated with the specified link
identifier.

This command is not effective for SELECT statements, only on statements which
modify records. To retrieve the number of rows returned from a SELECT, use 
sybase_num_rows().

参数

link_identifier

    If the link identifier isn't specified, the last opened link is assumed.

返回值

Returns the number of affected rows, as an integer.

范例

Example #1 Delete-Query

<?php
/* connect to database */
sybase_connect('SYBASE', '', '') or
die("Could not connect");
sybase_select_db("db");

sybase_query("DELETE FROM sometable WHERE id < 10");
printf("Records deleted: %d\n", sybase_affected_rows());
?>

以上例程会输出：

Records deleted: 10

===============================================================================

If you get a segfault with sybase-ct, add a en_US entry to your $SYBASE/locales
/locales.dat file:

[linux]
    locale = en_US, us_english, iso_1
    ...
===============================================================================

The sybase_affected_rows() function seems to work now with the Sybase DB
Library.  Not sure when this improvement was made, but I'm currently running
PHP 4.1.2 on Solaris.

Affected rows seems to return a -1 if the query syntax was incorrect on the
last submitted query.
Affected rows returns 0 if no rows were affected or another error occured, such
as a foreign key violation and also returns 0 if the query was successfully,
but no records were affected by the query.
If the query was valid and did affect some rows, sybase_affected_rows() seems
to be returning the correct number.

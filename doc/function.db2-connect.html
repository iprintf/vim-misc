(PECL ibm_db2 >= 1.0.0)

db2_connect — Returns a connection to a database

说明

resource db2_connect ( string $database , string $username , string $password
[, array $options ] )

Creates a new connection to an IBM DB2 Universal Database, IBM Cloudscape, or
Apache Derby database.

参数

database

    For a cataloged connection to a database, database represents the database
    alias in the DB2 client catalog.

    For an uncataloged connection to a database, database represents a complete
    connection string in the following format:

    DATABASE=database;HOSTNAME=hostname;PORT=port;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=username;PWD=password;

    where the parameters represent the following values:

    database

        The name of the database.

    hostname

        The hostname or IP address of the database server.

    port

        The TCP/IP port on which the database is listening for requests.

    username

        The username with which you are connecting to the database.

    password

        The password with which you are connecting to the database.

username

    The username with which you are connecting to the database.

    For uncataloged connections, you must pass a NULL value or empty string.

password

    The password with which you are connecting to the database.

    For uncataloged connections, you must pass a NULL value or empty string.

options

    An associative array of connection options that affect the behavior of the
    connection, where valid array keys include:

    autocommit

        Passing the DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_ON value turns autocommit on for this
        connection handle.

        Passing the DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF value turns autocommit off for this
        connection handle.

    DB2_ATTR_CASE

        Passing the DB2_CASE_NATURAL value specifies that column names are
        returned in natural case.

        Passing the DB2_CASE_LOWER value specifies that column names are
        returned in lower case.

        Passing the DB2_CASE_UPPER value specifies that column names are
        returned in upper case.

    CURSOR

        Passing the DB2_FORWARD_ONLY value specifies a forward-only cursor for
        a statement resource. This is the default cursor type and is supported
        on all database servers.

        Passing the DB2_SCROLLABLE value specifies a scrollable cursor for a
        statement resource. This mode enables random access to rows in a result
        set, but currently is supported only by IBM DB2 Universal Database.

    The following new option is available in ibm_db2 version 1.7.0 and later.

    trustedcontext

        Passing the DB2_TRUSTED_CONTEXT_ENABLE value turns trusted context on
        for this connection handle. This parameter cannot be set using 
        db2_set_option().

        This key works only if the database is cataloged (even if the database
        is local), or if you specify the full DSN when you create the
        connection.

        To catalog the database, use following commands:

        db2 catalog tcpip node loopback remote <SERVERNAME> server <SERVICENAME>
        db2 catalog database <LOCALDBNAME> as <REMOTEDBNAME> at node loopback
        db2 "update dbm cfg using svcename <SERVICENAME>"
        db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP

    The following new i5/OS options are available in ibm_db2 version 1.5.1 and
    later.

    i5_lib

        A character value that indicates the default library that will be used
        for resolving unqualified file references. This is not valid if the
        connection is using system naming mode.

    i5_naming

        DB2_I5_NAMING_ON value turns on DB2 UDB CLI iSeries system naming mode.
        Files are qualified using the slash (/) delimiter. Unqualified files
        are resolved using the library list for the job.

        DB2_I5_NAMING_OFF value turns off DB2 UDB CLI default naming mode,
        which is SQL naming. Files are qualified using the period (.)
        delimiter. Unqualified files are resolved using either the default
        library or the current user ID.

    i5_commit

        The i5_commit attribute should be set before the db2_connect(). If the
        value is changed after the connection has been established, and the
        connection is to a remote data source, the change does not take effect
        until the next successful db2_connect() for the connection handle.


            Note:

            The php.ini setting ibm_db2.i5_allow_commit==0 or
            DB2_I5_TXN_NO_COMMIT is the default, but may be overridden with the
            i5_commit option.

        DB2_I5_TXN_NO_COMMIT - Commitment control is not used.

        DB2_I5_TXN_READ_UNCOMMITTED - Dirty reads, nonrepeatable reads, and
        phantoms are possible.

        DB2_I5_TXN_READ_COMMITTED - Dirty reads are not possible. Nonrepeatable
        reads, and phantoms are possible.

        DB2_I5_TXN_REPEATABLE_READ - Dirty reads and nonrepeatable reads are
        not possible. Phantoms are possible.

        DB2_I5_TXN_SERIALIZABLE - Transactions are serializable. Dirty reads,
        non-repeatable reads, and phantoms are not possible

    i5_query_optimize

        DB2_FIRST_IO All queries are optimized with the goal of returning the
        first page of output as fast as possible. This goal works well when the
        output is controlled by a user who is most likely to cancel the query
        after viewing the first page of output data. Queries coded with an
        OPTIMIZE FOR nnn ROWS clause honor the goal specified by the clause.

        DB2_ALL_IO All queries are optimized with the goal of running the
        entire query to completion in the shortest amount of elapsed time. This
        is a good option when the output of a query is being written to a file
        or report, or the interface is queuing the output data. Queries coded
        with an OPTIMIZE FOR nnn ROWS clause honor the goal specified by the
        clause. This is the default.

    i5_dbcs_alloc

        DB2_I5_DBCS_ALLOC_ON value turns on DB2 6X allocation scheme for DBCS
        translation column size growth.

        DB2_I5_DBCS_ALLOC_OFF value turns off DB2 6X allocation scheme for DBCS
        translation column size growth.

        Note: php.ini setting ibm_db2.i5_dbcs_alloc==0 or DB2_I5_DBCS_ALLOC_OFF
        is the default, but may be overridden with the i5_dbcs_alloc option.

    i5_date_fmt

        DB2_I5_FMT_ISO - The International Organization for Standardization
        (ISO) date format yyyy-mm-dd is used. This is the default.

        DB2_I5_FMT_USA - The United States date format mm/dd/yyyy is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_EUR - The European date format dd.mm.yyyy is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_JIS - The Japanese Industrial Standard date format
        yyyy-mm-dd is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_MDY - The date format mm/dd/yyyy is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_DMY - The date format dd/mm/yyyy is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_YMD - The date format yy/mm/dd is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_JUL - The Julian date format yy/ddd is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_JOB - The job default is used.

    i5_date_sep

        DB2_I5_SEP_SLASH - A slash ( / ) is used as the date separator. This is
        the default.

        DB2_I5_SEP_DASH - A dash ( - ) is used as the date separator.

        DB2_I5_SEP_PERIOD - A period ( . ) is used as the date separator.

        DB2_I5_SEP_COMMA - A comma ( , ) is used as the date separator.

        DB2_I5_SEP_BLANK - A blank is used as the date separator.

        DB2_I5_SEP_JOB - The job default is used

    i5_time_fmt

        DB2_I5_FMT_ISO - The International Organization for Standardization
        (ISO) time format hh.mm.ss is used. This is the default.

        DB2_I5_FMT_USA - The United States time format hh:mmxx is used, where
        xx is AM or PM.

        DB2_I5_FMT_EUR - The European time format hh.mm.ss is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_JIS - The Japanese Industrial Standard time format hh:mm:ss
        is used.

        DB2_I5_FMT_HMS - The hh:mm:ss format is used.

    i5_time_sep

        DB2_I5_SEP_COLON - A colon ( : ) is used as the time separator. This is
        the default.

        DB2_I5_SEP_PERIOD - A period ( . ) is used as the time separator.

        DB2_I5_SEP_JOB - The job default is used.

    The following new i5/OS option is available in ibm_db2 version 1.8.0 and
    later.

    i5_libl

        A character value that indicates the library list that will be used for
        resolving unqualified file references. Specify the library list
        elements separated by blanks 'i5_libl'=>"MYLIB YOURLIB ANYLIB".

            Note:

            i5_libl calls qsys2/qcmdexc('cmd',cmdlen), which is only available
            in i5/OS V5R4 and later.

返回值

Returns a connection handle resource if the connection attempt is successful.
If the connection attempt fails, db2_connect() returns FALSE.

范例

Example #1 Creating a cataloged connection

Cataloged connections require you to have previously cataloged the target
database through the DB2 Command Line Processor (CLP) or DB2 Configuration
Assistant.

<?php
$database = 'SAMPLE';
$user = 'db2inst1';
$password = 'ibmdb2';

$conn = db2_connect($database, $user, $password);

if ($conn) {
    echo "Connection succeeded.";
    db2_close($conn);
}
else {
    echo "Connection failed.";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

Connection succeeded.

Example #2 Creating an uncataloged connection

An uncataloged connection enables you to dynamically connect to a database.

<?php
$database = 'SAMPLE';
$user = 'db2inst1';
$password = 'ibmdb2';
$hostname = 'localhost';
$port = 50000;

$conn_string = "DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};DATABASE=$database;" .
  "HOSTNAME=$hostname;PORT=$port;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=$user;PWD=$password;";
$conn = db2_connect($conn_string, '', '');

if ($conn) {
    echo "Connection succeeded.";
    db2_close($conn);
}
else {
    echo "Connection failed.";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

Connection succeeded.

Example #3 Creating a connection with autocommit off by default

Passing an array of options to db2_connect() enables you to modify the default
behavior of the connection handle.

<?php
$database = 'SAMPLE';
$user = 'db2inst1';
$password = 'ibmdb2';
$options = array('autocommit' => DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF);

$conn = db2_connect($database, $user, $password, $options);

if ($conn) {
    echo "Connection succeeded.\n";
    if (db2_autocommit($conn)) {
         echo "Autocommit is on.\n";
    }
    else {
         echo "Autocommit is off.\n";
    }
    db2_close($conn);
}
else {
    echo "Connection failed.";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

Connection succeeded.
Autocommit is off.

Example #4 i5/OS best performance

To achieve best performance for your i5/OS ibm_db2 1.5.1 PHP application use
the default host, userid, and password for your db2_connect().

<?php
  $library = "ADC";
  $i5 = db2_connect("", "", "", array("i5_lib"=>"qsys2"));
  $result = db2_exec($i5, 
       "select * from systables where table_schema = '$library'");
  while ($row = db2_fetch_both($result)) {               
     echo $row['TABLE_NAME']."</br>";                     
  }                                                      
  db2_close($i5);
?>

以上例程会输出：

NAMES
PICTURES

Example #5 Using trusted context

The following example shows how to enable trusted context, switch users, and
get the current user ID.

<?php

$database = "SAMPLE";
$hostname = "localhost";
$port = 50000;
$authID = "db2inst1";
$auth_pass = "ibmdb2";

$tc_user = "tcuser";
$tc_pass = "tcpassword";

$dsn = "DATABASE=$database;HOSTNAME=$hostname;PORT=$port;
  PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=$authID;PWD=$auth_pass;";
$options = array ("trustedcontext" => DB2_TRUSTED_CONTEXT_ENABLE);

$tc_conn = db2_connect($dsn, "", "", $options);
if($tc_conn) {
    echo "Explicit trusted connection succeeded.\n";

    if(db2_get_option($tc_conn, "trustedcontext")) {
        $userBefore = db2_get_option($tc_conn, "trusted_user");
        
        //Do some work as user 1.

        //Switching to trusted user.
        $parameters = array("trusted_user" => $tc_user, 
          "trusted_password" => $tcuser_pass);
        $res = db2_set_option ($tc_conn, $parameters, 1);

        $userAfter = db2_get_option($tc_conn, "trusted_user");
        //Do more work as trusted user.

        if($userBefore != $userAfter) {
            echo "User has been switched." . "\n";    
        }
    }

    db2_close($tc_conn);
}
else {
    echo "Explicit trusted connection failed.\n";
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

Explicit trusted connection succeeded.
User has been switched.

User Contributed Notes 1 note

===============================================================================

As of 09/29/2015 when using the ibm_db2 driver and specifying an invalid
library list with the 'i5_libl' option, the connection will be successfully
created but with a default library list.  What happens is the connection is
made and THEN the library list is attempted to be changed.  The connection will
be a success but the library list change will fail without "db2_conn_error()"
or "db2_conn_errormsg()" reporting anything and a default library list will be
used.  However, "db2_stmt_error()" and "db2_stmt_errormsg()" will register with
a value.  Also if error reporting is enable, the warning will be output to the
screen.  This is not a bug, rather intended behavior according to Zend (I
opened a ticked) and depending on which library list is used/swapped could lead
to major problems (development VS production).  I stumbled upon this behavior
when an anomaly (which I still can't explain) was imploding my library list
with the character 'Z'.  I realized I was in my development environment but
accessing production data as a result.  Going forward I will make sure to add
this additional check for good measure.

See below to recreate behavior:

<?php
ini_set("display_errors", 1);

$systemName = 'systemName';
$userID = 'userName';
$password = 'password';

$options['i5_libl'] = implode('Z', array(
        'INVALID',       
    'LIB',      
    'LIST',  
    'IMPLODED', 
    'WITH',  
    'THE',     
    'LETTER',      
    'Z'
    ));

$options['i5_naming'] = DB2_I5_NAMING_ON;

$conn = db2_connect($systemName, $userID, $password, $options);
//This line causes "ini_set("display_errors", 1)" to dislay this warning on the
screen:
//Warning: db2_connect(): Statement Execute Failed in /PATH/TO/FILE/test.php on
line 58

if (db2_stmt_error()) { //Evaluates to true
    echo "error ID: " . (db2_stmt_error()); //Displays error code: 38501
    echo "<br>error message: " . (db2_stmt_errormsg()); //Displays: Trigger
program or external routine detected an error. SQLCODE=-443
}

echo "<br />|".db2_conn_error()." ||| ".db2_conn_errormsg()."|<br />"; //Only "
| ||| |" is displayed
print_r($conn); //A resource ID is displayed
echo "<br />";

if(isset($conn) && $conn === true){
    echo "Boolean true<br />";
    //never executes, but not expected since either false or a resource ID
should be returned.
    //Plus it is clear $conn contains a resource ID from above.
}
if(isset($conn) && $conn == true){
    echo "Non-Boolean true 2<br />";
    //This always executes regardless of an accurate library list or not
    //I suppose "if($conn)" would evaluate to non-boolean true so this makes
sense.
}
if(isset($conn) && $conn == "true"){
    echo "String true";
    //Never executes, but not expected.
}
if(isset($conn) && $conn === false){
    echo "Boolean false<br />";
    //never executes because the connection itself was a success.
    //If invalid credentials were provided this executes.
}
if(isset($conn) && $conn == false){
    echo "Non-Boolean false 2<br />";
    //never executes because the connection itself was a success.
    //Added this here because I was unsure if a boolean false would be returned
or not.
    //If invalid credentials were provided this executes as well.
}
if(isset($conn) && $conn == "false"){
    echo "String false";
    //never executes because the connection itself was a success.
    //Added this here because I was unsure if a String "false" would be
returned
}
?>

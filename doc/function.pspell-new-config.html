===============================================================================

Today I ran into an interesting problem that I thought I'd share here to save
the next developer that ends up in the same situation a whole lot of trouble. I
have been running PHP5 as a FastCGI module on a Windows IIS server, and I
recently installed the Aspell library and enabled the pspell extension in my
php.ini file. I also installed the English Aspell dictionary. But when I went
to use pspell, I was getting ambiguous errors that would terminate script
execution without warning.

So I started to break things down, and came to the conclusion that the
following code successfully executed its first line, but broke on the last line
with the call to pspell_new_config:

<?php

$pspell_config = pspell_config_create('en');
$pspell_link = pspell_new_config($pspell_config);

?>

This returned a FastCGI error in the browser, with error number -2147467259
(0x80004005). By luck, I happened to think to try the same script via the
command line, which gave a much more descriptive error. What happened was that
the dictionary installer created the *.dat files in the Aspell\data directory
using the Windows standard CRLF "\r\n" instead of the UNIX standard "\n" for
line feeds. By changing these all back to the UNIX standard, everything worked.
It's apparently very touchy about these line feeds, so if you're wracking your
brain over why pspell_new_config is breaking your scripts and you're using a
Windows server, start by ensuring that there aren't any extraneous "\r"
characters in your dictionary files.

ifx_prepare — Prepare an SQL-statement for execution

说明

resource ifx_prepare ( string $query , resource $link_identifier [, int
$cursor_def ], mixed $blobidarray )

Prepares a query for later use with ifx_do().

For "select-type" queries a cursor is declared and opened. Non-select queries
are "execute immediate".

For either query type the number of (estimated or real) affected rows is saved
for retrieval by ifx_affected_rows().

If the contents of the TEXT (or BYTE) column allow it, you can also use
ifx_textasvarchar(1) and ifx_byteasvarchar(1). This allows you to treat TEXT
(or BYTE) columns just as if they were ordinary (but long) VARCHAR columns for
select queries, and you don't need to bother with blob id's.

With ifx_textasvarchar(0) or ifx_byteasvarchar(0) (the default situation),
select queries will return BLOB columns as blob id's (integer value). You can
get the value of the blob as a string or file with the blob functions (see
below).

参数

query

    The query string.

link_identifier

    The link identifier.

cursor_def

    This optional parameter allows you to make this a scroll and/or hold
    cursor. It's a bitmask and can be either IFX_SCROLL, IFX_HOLD, or both
    or'ed together.

blobidarray

    If you have BLOB (BYTE or TEXT) columns in the query, you can add a
    blobidarray parameter containing the corresponding "blob ids", and you
    should replace those columns with a "?" in the query text.

返回值

Returns a valid result identifier for use by ifx_do(), or FALSE on errors.

===============================================================================

This is an example to use this function

$conn = fx_connect( "db", "user", "password" );
$result = ifx_prepare("SELECT customer_num, company FROM customer", $conn);
ifx_do($result);

ifx_prepare associate an int to the query; we use this int with ifx_do

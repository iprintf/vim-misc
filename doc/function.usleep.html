WARNING!!

the snippet below by 'Marius (mm at co-operation dot de)' is NOT a usleep and
it will keep the CPU at 100% running. why people keep posting that crap is a
complete mystery for me.

the idea of sleep and usleep is that by letting the cpu run a few idle cycles
so the other programs can have some cycles run of their own. what results in
better response times and lower overall system-load. so if you have to wait for
something, go to sleep for a few seconds instead of occupying the cpu while
doing absolute nothing but waitting.
===============================================================================

A word of warning about the microdelay() code posted that uses the fsockopen -
if you use this is a loop that delays for small periods you will very quickly
run out of sockets/socket buffer space. And then your network connections go
very strange......
===============================================================================

To monitor a scripts CPU ussage and avoid any nasty CPU gobbling loops you can
use this function (will not work with windows or safe mode) I know it works on
FreeBSD:
function phpmon($max)
{
$cmd = `ps -Unobody -r -o%cpu`;
$lines = explode("\n", $cmd);
$usage = substr($lines[1], 0, strpos($lines[1], "."));
$sleeprate = 500;
while ($usage >= $max)
  {
  $cmd = `ps -Unobody -r -o%cpu`;
  $lines = explode("\n", $cmd);
  $usage = substr($lines[1], 0, strpos($lines[1], "."));
  usleep($sleeprate);
  }
}

phpmon($MAX);

where $MAX is the maximum CPU you want the process to consume. e-mail me with
any improvements/suggestions.

I have noticed that this consumes a lot of system CPU (at least in my limited
testing) possibly from all of the system calls or the huge mathematical
functions I used to test the effectiveness of the script.
===============================================================================

Should be noted that functions that loop really fast to create a delay also
consume 100% CPU while doing the loop.  Try creating a dummy loop that goes
100000 times, watch it choke your machine.  If you really need usleep() don't
use windows.
===============================================================================

On both MacOS X and Linux the usleep() call seems to consume CPU cycles,
whereas sleep() and time_nanosleep() do not. This was the same on PHP 5.3.29
and 5.5.29.

I used a loop with just a call to sleep/usleep/time_nanosleep, and compared
them all with an empty loop. Obviously the empty loop consumed 99% of the CPU,
sleep used 0%, usleep used 3% for 1000ms and 6% for 100ms, and time_nanosleep
used 0% for both 500ms and 1000ms.
===============================================================================

Dude you are SO the man for that code snippet. It worked like a charm. I just
wanted to point out a couple things and offer my own improvement.

1. If you're like me, you were probably wondering why the socket had to keep
being recreated on each call, and why you couldn't just create a static socket.
Its because socket_select assumes you're passing in a pointer, and will alter
the variable on return to reflect the actual sockets that were changed.

2. I couldn't figure out for the life of me why socket_select wasn't defined.
Its because you hadn't enabled the right extension in php.ini

Ok so heres my slight improvement. The only real thing I did is use a static
variable for the socket, to avoid creating a brand new socket on each call of
this function. I'm not sure if socket creation will cause things to crash down
the line like the other problems reported on here, but if you ask me better
safe then sorry.

function Sleeper($mSec)
{
    //    For dummies like me who spent 5 minutes
    //    wondering why socket_create wasn't defined
    if(!function_exists('socket_create')){
        die("Please enable extension php_sockets.dll");
    }

    //    So the socket is only created once
    static $socket=false;
    if($socket===false){
        $socket=array(socket_create(AF_INET,SOCK_RAW,0));
    }
    $pSock=$socket;
   
    //    Calc time
    $uSex = $mSec * 1000;

    //    Do the waiting
    socket_select($read=NULL,$write=NULL,$pSock,0,$uSex);
   
    //    OCD
    return true;
}

It should be noted that Windows machines have a resolution of either 10 mS or
15 mS (depending on the chipset implementation and HAL used) when using the
Sleep() function in kernel32.dll.  This means that your average error will be
either 5 or 7.5 mS.  This is not ordinarily a problem unless you really NEED to
sleep for less time than the granularity provided by Windows.
===============================================================================

If you're using Windows then you maybe are in trouble with usleep if you really
need to use it.

The Bernie's microdelay function using fsockopen does not work properly, and
the fclose doesn't help much.

I don't know if network connections go strange, but I know it does not work
since you've made more than 2000 - 3000 calls to it, so it's not a reliable
solution in 'long life' php scripts, or these are the issues of the microdelay
function in my PHP and PHP-GTK applications.

Though another solution should be found, and googling a bit I fount a WinAPI
function: Sleep.

So I get with this snippet wich works fine for me, you get milliseconds
precission but the more important, it works for long-run scripts and of course,
it does not waste any CPU cycles.

dl('php_w32api.dll');

$GLOBALS['win32api'] =& new win32;

// USleep alternative for Windows and PHP4:
$GLOBALS['win32api']->registerfunction("long Sleep (long dwMillisecods) From
kernel32.dll");

// Now you can call the function from everywhere in your script: $GLOBALS
['win32api']->Sleep(milliseconds);

for ($msec = 2000; $msec > 0; $msec = $msec - 125) {
  echo "Hi. Next one in $msec msec.\n";
  $GLOBALS['win32api']->Sleep($msec);
}
===============================================================================

I have spent DAYS trying to create a reliable usleep()-replacement for Windows.

I have only this to offer:

As commented by someone else already, the gettimeofday() method used below is
useless - PHP will use all available CPU power doing nothing.

The fsockopen() method apparently is also useless - as someone else commented,
an fclose() was missing in the original post, but this apparently does not
solve the problem. After calling the function about 50 or so times, fsockopen()
returns immidiately, without any delay - and watching a process monitor in
Windows, you can then watch the process taking up increasingly more memory,
until eventually PHP aborts (or crashes) when it reaches maximum.

The win32api-method is also a no-go ... after calling the Sleep function a few
hundred times (during which memory usage will also go up every time due to a
memory leak somewhere), PHP will cause an exception and Windows will terminate
it.

I have given up - I don't think there is any viable solution to this problem
under PHP 4.

If you need this function, upgrade your project to PHP 5.

Or settle for 1-second delays with the sleep()-function.

These, unfortunately, seem to be your only options...
===============================================================================

I have no idea why nobody came up with this yet, but there is an efficient way
to reproduce usleep() under windows:

<?php
function usleep_win($msec) {
   $usec = $msec * 1000;
   socket_select($read = NULL, $write = NULL, $sock = array(socket_create (
AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, 0)), 0, $usec);
}
?>

* Doesnt busy wait
* Doesnt eat memory
* Works for millions of repetitions
* Seems to be rather efficient

It seems that the average error (on my machine) is about 5ms (it sleeps 5ms
more than intended) thats probably due to code execution as well as kernel
timers.

A socket without any purpose is highly unlikely to every cause an exception, so
socket_select will always sleep until the timeout is hit.
===============================================================================

I want to create a daemon/Linux service. Here is an example of how to run a
process that has "throttle control"

// You must set these
//
// max_execution_time = 0
// max_input_time = 0

function doProcess() {
    echo "Start"."\n";
    usleep(10000);
    echo "Stop"."\n";
    return false;
}

function manageProcess() {
    // Setup data
    $runsPerMinute = 200;
    $maxMinuteAverage = 5;
    $waitIfNotWorking = 120; // seconds

    // Conversion
    $microsPerSecond = 1000000;

    // Statistical Info
    $currentMinute = 0;
    $minute = -1;
    $countPerMinute = array();
    $sumPerMinute = array();

    // Totals
    $totalProcessTime = 0;
    $totalCounts = 0;

    while (true) {
        $timestart = microtime();
        $performedWork = doProcess();
        $timeend = microtime();

        if (!$performedWork) {
            // Statistical Info
            $currentMinute = 0;
            $minute = -1;
            $countPerMinute = array();
            $sumPerMinute = array();

            sleep($waitIfNotWorking);
        } else {

            $ts = split(" ",$timestart);
            $te = split(" ",$timeend);

            $te[0] = ($te[0] * $microsPerSecond) - ($ts[0] * $microsPerSecond);
            $te[1] = ($te[1] - $ts[1]) * $microsPerSecond;

            $processTime = $te[0] + $te[1];

            if (date("i")<>$minute) { // We are NOT in the same minute
                // Reset the new minute
                $minute = date("i");
                $currentMinute = ($currentMinute+1) % $maxMinuteAverage;

                // Remove Statistical Information from the minute we are
expiring.
                if (isset($countPerMinute[$currentMinute])) {
                    $totalProcessTime = $totalProcessTime - $sumPerMinute
[$currentMinute];
                    $totalCounts = $totalCounts - $countPerMinute
[$currentMinute];
                }

                $countPerMinute[$currentMinute] = 0;
                $sumPerMinute[$currentMinute] = 0;
            }

            $countPerMinute[$currentMinute] = $countPerMinute[$currentMinute] +
1;
            $sumPerMinute[$currentMinute] = $sumPerMinute[$currentMinute] +
$processTime;

            $totalCounts = $totalCounts + 1;
            $totalProcessTime = $totalProcessTime + $processTime;

            $averageRuntime = round($totalProcessTime / $totalCounts);

            $waitTime = (($microsPerSecond*60) / $runsPerMinute) -
$averageRuntime;

            usleep($waitTime);
        }
    }

}

manageProcess();

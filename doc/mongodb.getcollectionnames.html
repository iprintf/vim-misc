MongoDB::getCollectionNames

(PECL mongo >=1.3.0)

MongoDB::getCollectionNames — Gets an array of names for all collections in
this database

说明

public array MongoDB::getCollectionNames ([ array $options = array() ] )

Gets a list of all collections in the database and returns their names as an
array of strings.

    Note: This method will use the » listCollections database command when
    communicating with MongoDB 2.8+. For previous database versions, the method
    will query the special system.namespaces collection.

参数

options

    An array of options for listing the collections. Currently available
    options include:
      □ "filter"

        Optional query criteria. If provided, this criteria will be used to
        filter the collections included in the result.

        Relevant fields that may be queried include "name" (collection name as
        a string, without the database name prefix) and "options" (object
        containing options used to create the collection)..

            Note: MongoDB 2.6 and earlier versions require the "name" criteria,
            if specified, to be a string value (i.e. equality match). This is
            because the driver must prefix the value with the database name in
            order to query the system.namespaces collection. Later versions of
            MongoDB do not have this limitation, as the driver will use the
            listCollections command.

      □ "includeSystemCollections"

        Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Determines whether system collections
        should be included in the result.

    The following option may be used with MongoDB 2.8+:
      □ "maxTimeMS"

        Specifies a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing the
        operation on the server (does not include idle time). If the operation
        is not completed by the server within the timeout period, a
        MongoExecutionTimeoutException will be thrown.

返回值

Returns the collection names as an array of strings.

错误／异常

For MongoDB 2.6 and earlier, MongoException will be thrown if a non-string
value was specified for the "filter" option's "name" criteria.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
1.6.0 Changed first parameter to be an array of options. Pre-1.6.0, the first
      parameter was a boolean indicating the "includeSystemCollections" option.

范例

Example #1 MongoDB::getCollectionNames() example

<?php
$m = new MongoClient();
$db = $m->selectDB("demo");
$collections = $db->getCollectionNames();

foreach ($collections as $collectionName) {
    echo "Found collection: ", $collectionName, "\n";
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

...
Found collection: img
Found collection: beer
Found collection: collation
...

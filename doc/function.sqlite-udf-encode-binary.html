(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_udf_encode_binary — Encode binary data before returning it from an UDF

说明

string sqlite_udf_encode_binary ( string $data )

sqlite_udf_encode_binary() applies a binary encoding to the data so that it can
be safely returned from queries (since the underlying libsqlite API is not
binary safe).

If there is a chance that your data might be binary unsafe (e.g.: it contains a
NUL byte in the middle rather than at the end, or if it has and 0x01 byte as
the first character) then you must call this function to encode the return
value from your UDF.

PHP does not perform this encode/decode operation automatically as it would
severely impact performance if it did.

    Note:

    Do not use sqlite_escape_string() to quote strings returned from UDF's as
    it will lead to double-quoting of the data. Use sqlite_udf_encode_binary()
    instead!

参数

data

    The string being encoded.

返回值

The encoded string.

===============================================================================

I wrote a script to transfer my old data from a mysql database, performing some
changes to a sqlite3 database. When I realized that that the sqlite interfaces
is no longer included in PHP and my PECL didn't get it installed it was too
late.

However, there is a very easy, though not particularly performant way to get
the job done like in the "sqlite_encode_blob" function I present below. Note
that this does ONLY encode the data. To actually use it in a query you will
have to wrap it like: X'data' See the example below.

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function sqlite_encode_blob($data) {
        $result = "";
        for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($data); $i++) {
                $result .= sprintf("%02X", ord(substr($data, $i, 1)));
        }
        return $result;
}

error_reporting(E_ALL);
$original = "62.jpg";
$data = file_get_contents($original);
$before = microtime(true);
$encodedData = sqlite_encode_blob($data);
$after = microtime(true);
unset($data);
echo "Encoding time needed: ".($after - $before)." seconds.\n";

$sql = <<<QUERY
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE test(test BLOB);
INSERT INTO test(test) VALUES ( X'$encodedData' );
COMMIT;
QUERY;
unset($encodedData);

file_put_contents("test.sql", $sql);
`sqlite3 blob_test.db < test.sql`
?>

The tricky part is to get the data back out of the database - that is not
possible with the command line tool as far as I can tell. You will have to use
a language with an actual API.

The following example is written in C and compiles on a linux box where the
sqlite3 API is installed using:
gcc -o test test.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sqlite3`
Note that this has absolutely no error checking whatsoever. If the slightest
thing goes wrong it will likely cause a segmentation fault and likely leave the
database corrupted.

# FILE test.c START
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>
#define DB_FILE "blob_test.db"
#define QUERY_STRING "SELECT data FROM test"
#define STORAGE_FILE "test.jpg"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        sqlite3 *db = NULL;
        int size = 0;
        const char *data = NULL;
        sqlite3_stmt *query = NULL;
        const char *rest = NULL;
        FILE *file = NULL;
        sqlite3_open(DB_FILE, &db);
        sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, QUERY_STRING, sizeof(QUERY_STRING), &query, &
rest);
        sqlite3_step(query);
        size = sqlite3_column_bytes(query, 0);
        data = sqlite3_column_blob(query, 0);
        file = fopen(STORAGE_FILE, "w");
        fwrite(data, 1, size, file);
        fclose(file);
        sqlite3_finalize(query);
        sqlite3_close(db);
        return 0;
}

# FILE test.c END

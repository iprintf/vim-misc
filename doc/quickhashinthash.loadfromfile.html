QuickHashIntHash::loadFromFile — This factory method creates a hash from a file

说明

public static QuickHashIntHash QuickHashIntHash::loadFromFile ( string
$filename [, int $options ] )

This factory method creates a new hash from a definition file on disk. The file
format consists of a signature 'QH\0x11\0', the number of elements as a 32 bit
signed integer in system Endianness, followed by 32 bit signed integers packed
together in the Endianness that the system that the code runs on uses. For each
hash element there are two 32 bit signed integers stored. The first of each
element is the key, and the second is the value belonging to the key. An
example could be:

Example #1 QuickHash IntHash file format

00000000  51 48 11 00 02 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  |QH..............|
00000010  03 00 00 00 09 00 00 00                           |........|
00000018

Example #2 QuickHash IntHash file format

header signature ('QH'; key type: 1; value type: 1; filler: \0x00)
00000000  51 48 11 00

number of elements:
00000004  02 00 00 00

data string:
00000000  01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  03 00 00 00 09 00 00 00

key/value 1 (key = 1, value = 1)
01 00 00 00  01 00 00 00

key/value 2 (key = 3, value = 9)
03 00 00 00  09 00 00 00

参数

filename

    The filename of the file to read the hash from.

options

    The same options that the class' constructor takes; except that the size
    option is ignored. It is automatically calculated to be the same as the
    number of entries in the hash, rounded up to the nearest power of two with
    a maximum limit of 4194304.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntHash.

范例

Example #3 QuickHashIntHash::loadFromFile() example

<?php
$file = dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.hash";
$hash = QuickHashIntHash::loadFromFile(
    $file,
    QuickHashIntHash::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC
);
foreach( range( 0, 0x0f ) as $key )
{
    printf( "Key %3d (%2x) is %s\n",
        $key, $key, 
        $hash->exists( $key ) ? 'set' : 'unset'
    );
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Key   0 ( 0) is unset
Key   1 ( 1) is set
Key   2 ( 2) is set
Key   3 ( 3) is set
Key   4 ( 4) is unset
Key   5 ( 5) is set
Key   6 ( 6) is unset
Key   7 ( 7) is set
Key   8 ( 8) is unset
Key   9 ( 9) is unset
Key  10 ( a) is unset
Key  11 ( b) is set
Key  12 ( c) is unset
Key  13 ( d) is set
Key  14 ( e) is unset
Key  15 ( f) is unset

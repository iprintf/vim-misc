QuickHashIntSet::loadFromFile — This factory method creates a set from a file

说明

public static QuickHashIntSet QuickHashIntSet::loadFromFile ( string $filename
[, int $size [, int $options ]] )

This factory method creates a new set from a definition file on disk. The file
format consists of 32 bit signed integers packed together in the Endianness
that the system that the code runs on uses.

参数

filename

    The filename of the file to read the set from.

size

    The amount of bucket lists to configure. The number you pass in will be
    automatically rounded up to the next power of two. It is also automatically
    limited from 4 to 4194304.

options

    The same options that the class' constructor takes; except that the size
    option is ignored. It is automatically calculated to be the same as the
    number of entries in the set, rounded up to the nearest power of two with a
    maximum limit of 4194304.

返回值

Returns a new QuickHashIntSet.

范例

Example #1 QuickHashIntSet::loadFromFile() example

<?php
$file = dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.set";
$set = QuickHashIntSet::loadFromFile(
    $file,
    QuickHashIntSet::DO_NOT_USE_ZEND_ALLOC
);
foreach( range( 0, 0x0f ) as $key )
{
    printf( "Key %3d (%2x) is %s\n",
        $key, $key, 
        $set->exists( $key ) ? 'set' : 'unset'
    );
}
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Key   0 ( 0) is unset
Key   1 ( 1) is set
Key   2 ( 2) is set
Key   3 ( 3) is set
Key   4 ( 4) is unset
Key   5 ( 5) is set
Key   6 ( 6) is unset
Key   7 ( 7) is set
Key   8 ( 8) is unset
Key   9 ( 9) is unset
Key  10 ( a) is unset
Key  11 ( b) is set
Key  12 ( c) is unset
Key  13 ( d) is set
Key  14 ( e) is unset
Key  15 ( f) is unset

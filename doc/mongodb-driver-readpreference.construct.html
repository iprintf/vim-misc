MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::__construct — Construct immutable ReadPreference

说明

final public MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::__construct ( string $mode [, array
$tagSets ] )

Creates a new ReadPreference.

参数

mode

                             Read preference mode
                    Value                              Description
                                           All operations read from the current
    MongoDB\Driver\                        replica set primary. This is the
    ReadPreference::RP_PRIMARY             default read preference for MongoDB.

                                           In most situations, operations read
    MongoDB\Driver\                        from the primary but if it is
    ReadPreference::RP_PRIMARY_PREFERRED   unavailable, operations read from
                                           secondary members.

                                           All operations read from the
    MongoDB\Driver\                        secondary members of the replica
    ReadPreference::RP_SECONDARY           set.

                                           In most situations, operations read
    MongoDB\Driver\                        from secondary members but if no
    ReadPreference::RP_SECONDARY_PREFERRED secondary members are available,
                                           operations read from the primary.

                                           Operations read from member of the
    MongoDB\Driver\                        replica set with the least network
    ReadPreference::RP_NEAREST             latency, irrespective of the
                                           member's type.

tagSets

    Tag sets allow you to target read operations to specific members of a
    replica set. This parameter should be an array of associative arrays, each
    of which contain zero or more key/value pairs. When selecting a server for
    a read operation, the driver attempt to select a node having all tags in a
    set (i.e. the associative array of key/value pairs). If selection fails,
    the driver will attempt subsequent sets. An empty tag set (array()) will
    match any node and may be used as a fallback.

    Tags are not compatible with the MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::RP_PRIMARY
    mode and, in general, only apply when selecting a secondary member of a set
    for a read operation. However, the MongoDB\Driver\
    ReadPreference::RP_NEAREST mode, when combined with a tag set, selects the
    matching member with the lowest network latency. This member may be a
    primary or secondary.

错误／异常

  • Throws MongoDB\Driver\Exception\InvalidArgumentException on argument
    parsing errors.
  • Throws MongoDB\Driver\Exception\InvalidArgumentException if mode is invalid
    or if tagSets is provided for a primary read preference.

范例

Example #1 MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::__construct() example

<?php

/* Prefer a secondary node but fall back to a primary. */
$rp = new MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference(MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::
RP_SECONDARY_PREFERRED);

/* Prefer a node in the New York data center with lowest latency. */
$rp = new MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference(MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::
RP_NEAREST, [['dc' => 'ny']]);

?>

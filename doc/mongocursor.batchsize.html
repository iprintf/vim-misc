MongoCursor::batchSize

(PECL mongo >=1.0.11)

MongoCursor::batchSize — Limits the number of elements returned in one batch.

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::batchSize ( int $batchSize )

A cursor typically fetches a batch of result objects and store them locally.
This method sets the batchSize value to configure the amount of documents
retrieved from the server in one round trip. However, it will never return more
documents than fit in the max batch size limit (usually 4MB).

参数

batchSize

    The number of results to return per batch. Each batch requires a round-trip
    to the server.

    If batchSize is 2 or more, it represents the size of each batch of objects
    retrieved. It can be adjusted to optimize performance and limit data
    transfer.

    If batchSize is 1 or negative, it will limit of number returned documents
    to the absolute value of batchSize, and the cursor will be closed. For
    example if batchSize is -10, then the server will return a maximum of 10
    documents and as many as can fit in 4MB, then close the cursor.

    Warning

    A batchSize of 1 is special, and means the same as -1, i.e. a value of 1
    makes the cursor only capable of returning one document.

    Note that this feature is different from MongoCursor::limit() in that
    documents must fit within a maximum size, and it removes the need to send a
    request to close the cursor server-side. The batch size can be changed even
    after a cursor is iterated, in which case the setting will apply on the
    next batch retrieval.

    This cannot override MongoDB's limit on the amount of data it will return
    to the client (i.e., if you set batch size to 1,000,000,000, MongoDB will
    still only return 4-16MB of results per batch).

    To ensure consistent behavior, the rules of MongoCursor::batchSize() and 
    MongoCursor::limit() behave a little complex but work "as expected". The
    rules are: hard limits override soft limits with preference given to 
    MongoCursor::limit() over MongoCursor::batchSize(). After that, whichever
    is set and lower than the other will take precedence. See below. section
    for some examples.

返回值

Returns this cursor.

范例

Example #1 MongoCursor::batchSize() and combinations with MongoCursor::limit()

<?php

// one batch, at most 10 items. The -10 makes the server to return 10 items,
// and then remove the cursor.
$cursor->limit(20)->batchSize(-10);

// first batch: at most 10 items
$cursor->limit(10);

// first batch: at most 10 items
$cursor->limit(10)->batchSize(20);

// results are fetched in batches of 10 each, with a maximum of 20 items
// returned (that means two batches of 10).
$cursor->limit(20)->batchSize(10);

// results are fetched in batches of 7 each, with a maximum of 30 items
// returned (that means that the driver requests 4 batches of 7, and one batch
// of 2).
$cursor->limit(30)->batchSize(7)
?>

更新日志

版本                                    说明
1.4.5 Before 1.4.5, this method would throw an MongoCursorException if the
      cursor had already started iterating.

You are wrong, since it will just work if the encoding of the characters is
also used in the current context.
There is a reason why it comes with the charset :)

There are way better solutions with imap_mime_header_decode
===============================================================================

Here is a clean way to decode encoded imap headers that will work in all cases
:

function fix_text($str)
{
    $subject = '';
    $subject_array = imap_mime_header_decode($str);

    foreach ($subject_array AS $obj)
        $subject .= rtrim($obj->text, "\t");

    return $subject;
}

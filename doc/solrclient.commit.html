SolrClient::commit — Finalizes all add/deletes made to the index

说明

public SolrUpdateResponse SolrClient::commit ([ bool $softCommit = false [, 
bool $waitSearcher = true [, bool $expungeDeletes = false ]]] )

This method finalizes all add/deletes made to the index.

参数

softCommit

    This will refresh the 'view' of the index in a more performant manner, but
    without "on-disk" guarantees. (Solr4.0+)

    A soft commit is much faster since it only makes index changes visible and
    does not fsync index files or write a new index descriptor. If the JVM
    crashes or there is a loss of power, changes that occurred after the last
    hard commit will be lost. Search collections that have near-real-time
    requirements (that want index changes to be quickly visible to searches)
    will want to soft commit often but hard commit less frequently.

waitSearcher

    block until a new searcher is opened and registered as the main query
    searcher, making the changes visible.

expungeDeletes

    Merge segments with deletes away. (Solr1.4+)

返回值

Returns a SolrUpdateResponse object on success or throws an exception on
failure.

错误／异常

Throws SolrClientException if the client had failed, or there was a connection
issue.

Throws SolrServerException if the Solr Server had failed to process the
request.

===============================================================================

Go easy on your use of commit - use the <autocommit /> section solrconfig.xml
instead.

Also consider using optimize() once a day if you are doing lots of adds/
removes.

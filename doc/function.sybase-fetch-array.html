sybase_fetch_array — Fetch row as array

说明

array sybase_fetch_array ( resource $result )

sybase_fetch_array() is an extended version of sybase_fetch_row(). In addition
to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores
the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using sybase_fetch_array() is NOT
significantly slower than using sybase_fetch_row(), while it provides a
significant added value.

参数

result

返回值

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

    Note:

    When selecting fields with identical names (for instance, in a join), the
    associative indices will have a sequential number prepended. See the
    example for details.

范例

Example #1 Identical fieldnames

<?php

$dbh = sybase_connect('SYBASE', '', '');
$q = sybase_query('SELECT * FROM p, a WHERE p.person_id= a.person_id');
var_dump(sybase_fetch_array($q));
sybase_close($dbh);
?>

The above example would produce the following output (assuming the two tables
only have each one column called "person_id"):

array(4) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
  ["person_id"]=>
  int(1)
  [1]=>
  int(1)
  ["person_id1"]=>
  int(1)
}

===============================================================================

For varchar type fields, sybase api fetch is limited with 255 characters.
In sybase you can have a varchar field nearly upto a page size, ex: varchar
(1500)

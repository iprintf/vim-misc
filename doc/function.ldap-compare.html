Example #1 Complete example of password check

<?php

$ds=ldap_connect("localhost");  // assuming the LDAP server is on this host

if ($ds) {

    // bind
    if (ldap_bind($ds)) {

        // prepare data
        $dn = "cn=Matti Meikku, ou=My Unit, o=My Company, c=FI";
        $value = "secretpassword";
        $attr = "password";

        // compare value
        $r=ldap_compare($ds, $dn, $attr, $value);

        if ($r === -1) {
            echo "Error: " . ldap_error($ds);
        } elseif ($r === true) {
            echo "Password correct.";
        } elseif ($r === false) {
            echo "Wrong guess! Password incorrect.";
        }

    } else {
        echo "Unable to bind to LDAP server.";
    }

    ldap_close($ds);

} else {
    echo "Unable to connect to LDAP server.";
}

===============================================================================

Just a side note that this is not how you'd ever AUTHENTICATE someone, just an
example code.

The common way to authenticate is to get the users name, use search and perhaps
selection to the user to get her DN (single value) then attempt to BIND to the
ldapserver using that dn and the offered password.  If it works, then it's the
right password.

Note that the password offered MUST NOT BE EMPTY or many LDAPs will presume you
meant to authenticate anonymously and it will succeed, leaving you thinking
it's the right password.
===============================================================================

With PHP 4.3.* is Password no longer a valid attribute.. try to use
userPassword
===============================================================================

Not probably, will.  With PHP 4.0.4 and openldap 1.2.9 this little script, even
with the correct attributes for the password does not do the job.  Would superb
if it did!
===============================================================================

Interesting example. Apart from the fact that very few people would allow
comaprisions of the password attribute for security reasons. The attribute name
of "password" does not match the usual schemas.

The usual method of user id + password verification is to attempt to bind using
the supplied credentials.

Ldap compare on password values will probably fail with ns directroy server and
openldap v2+ becuase of server support for password hashing.

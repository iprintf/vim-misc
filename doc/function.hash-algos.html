范例

Example #1 hash_algos() 例程

在 PHP 5.6.0 中，hash_algos() 会返回下表所示的算法清单：

<?php
print_r(hash_algos());
?>

以上例程的输出类似于：

Array

    [0] => md2
    [1] => md4
    [2] => md5
    [3] => sha1
    [4] => sha224

Ansewring to holdoffhunger avoid crc32, the are different results because the
crc32(); use the algorithm 'crc32b'. To check this only have to write:

echo hash('crc32b', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'), "\n";
echo dechex (crc32('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'));

And check that both have the same results:

82a34642
82a34642
===============================================================================

If you print the results of the hash_algos function and look at all of the
available hashing functions, you will find three with duplicate functions: md5,
sha1, crc32, and sha256.  That means you can call the any of these function
with either its own function or the hash function.  For example, with the SHA1
function :

<?php

            // Author: holdoffhunger@gmail.com

    $sha1_first_value = sha1("secret", FALSE);

    $sha1_second_value = hash("sha1", "secret", FALSE);

?>

However, the alternate title for the SHA256 algorithm is "getImageSignature",
as part of the ImageMagick application package.  Oddly, the CRC32 function
returns different values when called from its own particular function (crc32())
compared to when it's called through the hash function (hash()).  This leads me
to suspect that they may be different implementations of the crc32 algorithm
altogether.  The different functions for SHA1 and MD5, however, produce the
same results.  The SHA-256 algorithm, as implemented in the ImageMagick
function, also produces different results compared to the results of the
hash_file() function within the Hash application package.

For the String "1234567890", the single CRC32() Function (which doesn't have an
option for binary, "raw data" representation) produces "639479525", but when
called through the Hash() Function, that same string produces "b6536850".  I
cannot find the relationship of any of these values, as they are not inverses
of each other, nor is their sum or difference equal to any power of two (as I
suspected they might be an equal distance from 0 or 2^32).

Both the SHA1 and MD5 alternate functions have the parameter of "TRUE/FALSE" at
the end to indicate whether the result is given in binary (raw data) or not. 
Unfortunately, this often turns out to be data that doesn't print very well. 
It is recommended to be printed with the statement of printf("%u\n",
$crc_32_value);.  However, that often doesn't produce any usable results,
either.  The only method I have discovered is the "bin2hex" function, like so :

<?php

    $md5_value = hash("md5", "secret", FALSE);
    $md5_value_in_hex = bin2hex($md5_value);

?>

However, bin2hex returns a hexadecimal representation, whereas you probably
wanted a string of binary 1's and 0's.  You can use the base_convert function,
such as base_convert($md5_value_in_hex, 16, 2);.  However, base_convert doesn't
work on large numbers, so you have to write your own function for converting
Hex to Binary.

One other thing that will probably catch your attention is that half of the
listed algorithms have similar names, but are represented with different
numbers.  That means that the algorithm takes parameters itself, such as number
of bits for the resultant hash value and number of rounds to do in producing
the hashed result.  The first number in the title of the Hash Function usually
indicates the size of the hash result, such as 128 bit for "haval128,3" and 160
bit for "tiger160,4".  The second number, however, indicates the number of
rounds, such as 5 rounds for "haval224,5".
===============================================================================

These algorithms can be used to generate a session ID. Just pick a string value
from the list and feed the session.hash_function directive with it. E.g.:

<?php
ini_set('session.hash_function', 'whirlpool');
?>

libxml2 contains much more useful method readString() that will read and return
whole text content of element. You can call it after receiving start tag
(XMLReader::ELEMENT). You can use this PHP code to emulate this method until
PHP will directly call underlying libxml2 implementation.

<?php
class XMLReader2 extends XMLReader
{
  function readString()
  {
        $depth = 1;
        $text = "";

        while ($this->read() && $depth != 0)
        {
            if (in_array($this->nodeType, array(XMLReader::TEXT, XMLReader::
CDATA, XMLReader::WHITESPACE, XMLReader::SIGNIFICANT_WHITESPACE)))
                $text .= $this->value;
            if ($this->nodeType == XMLReader::ELEMENT) $depth++;
            if ($this->nodeType == XMLReader::END_ELEMENT) $depth--;
        }
        return $text;
    }
}
?>

Just use XMLReader2 instead of XMLReader.

It is interesting to note that this function will stop on closing tags as
well.  I have an XML document similar to the following:

<root>
  <columns>
    <column>columnX</column>
    <column>columnY</column>
  </columns>
  <table>
    <row>
      <columnX>38</columnX>
      <columnY>50</columnY>
    </row>
    <row>
      <columnX>82</columnY>
      <columnY>28</columnY>
    </row>
    ...
  </table>
</root>

I need to parse the <columns> object to know what attributes to check for from
each <row> node.  Therefore I was doing the following:

<?php
while ($xml->read()) {
  if ($xml->name === 'column') {
   //parse column node to into $columns array
  }
  elseif ($xml->name === 'row') {
    //parse row node, using constructed $columns array
  }
}
?>

This kind of worked in that I ended up with an array of all the data I wanted,
but the array I constructed was twice as large as I expected and every other
entry was empty.  Took me a while to debug, but finally figured out that
checking <?php $xml->name === 'row' ?> matches both <row> and </row>, so the
check should really be something more like:

<?php

if ($xml->name === 'row' && $xml->nodeType == XMLReader::ELEMENT) {
  // parse row node
}

?>

I would have liked to use the next() function instead, but as I needed to parse
2 different subtrees, I couldn't figure out how to find all the columns, reset
the pointer, and then find all the rows.

If like myself you have been turning the interwebz upside down looking for a
solution for this issue:
PHP Warning:  XMLReader::read(): /tmp/xml_feed.xml:4183934: parser error :
Input is not proper UTF-8, indicate encoding !

For some reason, this warning breaks the execution - is it a fatal error in
disguise?

After days of frustration I found it!!!!
tidy -xml -o output.xml -utf8 -f error.log input.xml

You can invoque tidy using exec, It takes several seconds to convert a 250Mb
feed, but it worthy the time.

In my case the issue was with latin1 charset, and for some reason I had to pass
the xml through tidy 2 times - first time around creates new errors, second
time it fixes everything.

I know invalid xml should be fixed by xml creators, but it works differently in
the real world.

I just use:

$reader->close();
$reader->open($url);

to reset the pointer.

If you have trouble parsing xml documents with text tags bigger than 10MB, this
might help you:

<?php
$xmlreader = new XMLReader();
$xmlreader->open($uri, null, 1<<19);
?>

Since in libxml there is a constant
XML_PARSE_HUGE = 1<<19
which enables parsing xml documents with huge texts.

Please note that this option is not accessible using the setParserProperty
method and that there is currently no constant to do the work, which will
hopefully change soon:

A very simple way to avoid typing $reader->read() multiple times when you want
to skip some nodes:

<?php
class smartXMLReader extends XMLReader {
    public function readTimes($count) {
        $i = 0;
        while($i < $count){
            $this->read();
            $i++;
        }
    }
}
?>

Using this smartXMLReader,

<?php
$reader->readTimes(3);
?>

is equivalent to

<?php
$reader->read();
$reader->read();
$reader->read();
?>

Makes getting around in your XML document a bit easier :)

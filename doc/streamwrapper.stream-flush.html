streamWrapper::stream_flush — Flushes the output

说明

public bool streamWrapper::stream_flush ( void )

This method is called in response to fflush() and when the stream is being
closed while any unflushed data has been written to it before.

If you have cached data in your stream but not yet stored it into the
underlying storage, you should do so now.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

Should return TRUE if the cached data was successfully stored (or if there was
no data to store), or FALSE if the data could not be stored.

注释

    Note:

    If not implemented, FALSE is assumed as the return value.

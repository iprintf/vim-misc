eregi

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

eregi — 不区分大小写的正则表达式匹配

说明

int eregi ( string $pattern , string $string [, array &$regs ] )

本函数和 ereg() 完全相同，只除了在匹配字母字符时忽略大小写的区别。

Example #1 eregi() 例子

<?php
$string = 'XYZ';
   if (eregi('z', $string)) {
    echo "'$string' contains a 'z' or 'Z'!";
}
?>

参见 ereg()，ereg_replace()，eregi_replace()，stripos() 和 stristr()。

"^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+(:?\.svg|\.wmf|\.zip|\.tar\.gz|\.tgz)$"

That is the proper file check for a well formatted beginning and ending
filename for those select files. The one in this list is incorrect for at least
php 4.3.0 which is what I'm using.

The (:?) makes sure that the parentheses aren't used for storing the matched
regex.

A little interesting and hopefully on topic point I found while browsing the
internet at: http://www.clemburg.com/x1713.html#AEN1717

According to RFC 822 (see http://www.rfc-editor.org/), email addresses
are case-sensitive in the part before the "@" sign, except for the
special address "POSTMASTER", which is not case-sensitive. The part
after the "@" sign is a host name, and is not case-sensitive.

Note that many organizations will implement an aliasing facility that
recognizes alternative forms for an email address (e.g., providing
"John.Doe@my.organization.com", "john.doe@my.organization.com",
"doe@my.organization.com", "Doe@my.organization.com" etc.). However,
this is not required by the standard as specified in RFC 822.

so you may want to keep that in mind....
i.e. breakup the username/alias (ereg) and domain (eregi) parts of the email

Email Address RegEx -- The Final Frontier?

Inspired by bobocop's stalwart effort. Cheers for that matey!

Contrary to most folks' expectation, a quoted @ character is permitted in the
local part of an email address. So strictly speaking bobocop's test result for
'@exam@exam.com' is ...inconclusive?

The RFC prohibits control characters in the address. So it's no coincidence
that most header-related exploits try to inject control characters into the
fields sent to the server. If we're validating client-side, we need to ensure
user input is restricted to the printable code set. And in the spirit of not
trusting anything inbound, we need to filter again server-side. It's handy
to have the same regex working at both ends.

My variant of bobocop's regex is listed below. Note the mask for the local
part matches any printable character *excluding the dot*. The dot is reserved
as a label separator. Bobocop's regex enforces that role while ensuring the
local part does not start or end with a dot.

Outside of the 7-bit ASCII and dot rules, the RFC says 'anything goes' in the
local part. Them's the breaks folks.

All we need to realise is that our endeavours are limited, and the nearest
we'll get to validating an email address is finding an MX record in DNS.
Whatever, don't go probing mail servers with test emails, you might get more
than you bargained for. That's sp@mmer territory, that is.
If you want to positively vet a mail server, consider running a check against
sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org. Search for the checkdnsrr function page on this site and
read the comments for good info.

Anyhoo, here's the modded regex builder:

//the variables
$local            = '[\x20-\x2D\x2F-\x7E]';
$alnum            = 'a-z0-9';
$domain            = "([$alnum]([-$alnum]*[$alnum]+)?)";

//the array
$arr            = array();
$arr['start']    = '^';
$arr['local']    = "$local+(\.$local+)*";
$arr['at']        = '@';
$arr['domain']    = "($domain{1,63}\.)+";
$arr['tld']        = "[$alnum]{2,6}";
$arr['end']        = '$';

//the regex
$regex            = implode('',$arr);

/**

$regex evaluates to:

^[\x20-\x2D\x2F-\x7E]+(\.[\x20-\x2D\x2F-\x7E]+)*@
(([a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9]+)?){1,63}\.)+[a-z0-9]{2,6}$

(regex split into 2 lines due to line length limits)

Add virgules front and back for the javascript equivalent.

I'm running this in an AJAX app right now and it does what it says on the tin.

If you're uncomfortable with the character length limits on domain and tld
names, change them to taste.

hodsfords:

i love your expression,
and i've came out with a solutions which does not need to set the number of
times {1,3} for the domain.
it can accept unlimited number of times, but @ least 1 time .com / .xxx

$exp = "^[a-z0-9]+[a-z0-9\?\.\+-_]*" .
@[a-z0-9_-]+(\.[a-z0-9_-]+)*\.[a-z]+$";
===============================================================================

This example checks for a valid IP address or CIDR notation address range.
(Thanks Walo for just the start I needed.)

The reg exp is too long to post in the code. It is:
^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}(/[0-9]{1,2}){0,1}$
(substitute for EXPR)

<?php

function checkValidIp($cidr) {

    // Checks for a valid IP address or optionally a cidr notation range
    // e.g. 1.2.3.4 or 1.2.3.0/24

   if(!eregi("EXPR", $cidr)) {
       $return = FALSE;
   } else {
       $return = TRUE;
   }
   
    if ( $return == TRUE ) {

        $parts = explode("/", $cidr);
        $ip = $parts[0];
        $netmask = $parts[1];
        $octets = explode(".", $ip);

        foreach ( $octets AS $octet ) {
            if ( $octet > 255 ) {
                $return = FALSE;
            }
        }

        if ( ( $netmask != "" ) && ( $netmask > 32 ) ) {
            $return = FALSE;
        }

    }

    return $return;

}

?>
===============================================================================

It's probably worth noting that eregi() (and most likely, the related
variations) appears to have a 255-character limit with respect to the length of
the input it will attempt to parse.

If you try to do something like

if (!eregi("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,256}$", $text)) { ...

eregi() will return FALSE, irrespective of whether or not the input matches the

The EvStat class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

EvStat monitors a file system path for attribute changes. It calls stat() on
that path in regular intervals(or when the OS signals it changed) and sees if
it changed compared to the last time, invoking the callback if it did.

The path does not need to exist: changing from "path exists" to "path does not
exist" is a status change like any other. The condition "path does not exist"
is signified by the 'nlink' item being 0(returned by EvStat::attr() method).

The path must not end in a slash or contain special components such as '.' or
.. . The path should be absolute: if it is relative and the working directory
changes, then the behaviour is undefined.

Since there is no portable change notification interface available, the
portable implementation simply calls stat() regularly on the path to see if it
changed somehow. For this case a recommended polling interval can be specified.
If one specifies a polling interval of 0.0 (highly recommended) then a
suitable, unspecified default value will be used(which could be expected to be
around 5 seconds, although this might change dynamically). libev will also
impose a minimum interval which is currently around 0.1 , but that’s usually
overkill.

This watcher type is not meant for massive numbers of EvStat watchers, as even
with OS-supported change notifications, this can be resource-intensive.

属性

interval

    Readonly . Hint on how quickly a change is expected to be detected and
    should normally be specified as 0.0 to let libev choose a suitable value.

path

    Readonly . The path to wait for status changes on.

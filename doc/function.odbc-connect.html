odbc_connect

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

odbc_connect — Connect to a datasource

说明

resource odbc_connect ( string $dsn , string $user , string $password [, int
$cursor_type ] )

The connection id returned by this functions is needed by other ODBC functions.
You can have multiple connections open at once as long as they either use
different db or different credentials.

With some ODBC drivers, executing a complex stored procedure may fail with an
error similar to: "Cannot open a cursor on a stored procedure that has anything
other than a single select statement in it". Using SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC may avoid
that error. Also, some drivers don't support the optional row_number parameter
in odbc_fetch_row(). SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC might help in that case, too.

参数

dsn

    The database source name for the connection. Alternatively, a DSN-less
    connection string can be used.

user

    The username.

password

    The password.

cursor_type

    This sets the type of cursor to be used for this connection. This parameter
    is not normally needed, but can be useful for working around problems with
    some ODBC drivers.

    The following constants are defined for cursortype:

      □ SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED
      □ SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC
      □ SQL_CUR_USE_DRIVER

返回值

Returns an ODBC connection or (FALSE) on error.

To make a DSN-less connection using ODBC to MS-SQL:

<?php

$connection_string = 'DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=<servername>;DATABASE=
<databasename>';

$user = 'username';
$pass = 'password';

$connection = odbc_connect( $connection_string, $user, $pass );

?>

servername is the name of the database server

databasename is the name of the database

Note, I've only tried this from a windows box using the Microsoft ODBC drivers.
===============================================================================

As always Microsoft is clueless... I've been trying to connect to an Access
database on a W2K on the network (not a local file, but mapped on the V:
drive), via ODBC.

All I got is this message:
Warning: SQL error: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] '(unknown)' is
not a valid path. Make sure that the path name is spelled correctly and that
you are connected to the server on which the file resides., SQL state S1009 in
SQLConnect in d:\apache\cm\creaart.php on line 13

So... I started looking al around and looks like the ODBC driver has some
severe problems:

1. It cannot access a Access database via a mapped drive. And this is for ANY
application, name it PHP, Coldfusion, whatever
2. You cannot make a system DSN with a UNC (\\Server\resource), so you must map
the drive

Cute isn't it?

So... I quit on ODBC and went via ADO, this is the code that works:

=== CODE ===

$db = '\\\\server\\resource\\db.mdb';
$conn = new COM('ADODB.Connection');
$conn->Open("DRIVER={Driver do Microsoft Access (*.mdb)}; DBQ=$db");

// Driver do Microsoft Access (*.mdb)
// must be the name in your odbc drivers, the one you get
// from the Data Sources (ODBC).
// In this case, I'm in Mexico but the driver name is in portuguese, thanks
Microsoft.

$sql = 'SELECT username FROM tblUsuarios';
$res = $conn->Execute($sql);
while (!$res->EOF)
{
    print $res->Fields['username']->Value . "<br>";
    $res->MoveNext();
}

$res->Close();
$conn->Close();
$res = null;
$conn = null;

=== /CODE ===
===============================================================================

After doing "harald dot angel at gmail dot com" suggestion, you may still
receive this error:

"Warning: odbc_connect() [function.odbc-connect]: SQL error: [Microsoft][ODBC
Microsoft Access Driver] The Microsoft Jet database engine cannot open the file
'(unknown)'. It is already opened exclusively by another user, or you need
permission to view its data., SQL state S1000 in SQLConnect in... "

You may need to include the <computer name> of the machine where the ODBC is,
to the <local group> of the machine where the *.mdb is stored. And make sure
that the <local group> has enough permission to access the *.mdb.

hope this make somebody more happy!

more power to opensource.
===============================================================================

- Windows - OS
- Apache
- ODBC-Connction to MS-Access DB on a:
- Network Share

After many hours searching here´s how it works:

- Map the Network Drive where the mdb is located
- Setup System DSN in Control Panel with mapped Drive
- Open Registry at:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC_INI
- Edit the for example "M:\" to "\\server\..."
- Close Regedit
- The Apache-Service must run with a Domain (network)-User!!
- After that you can connect using:

$conn = odbc_connect('your-dsn-name','','');

hope that makes someone happy :)

Two additional notes regarding ODBC connections to a Network Sybase SQL
Anywhere 8 Server..

I wrote a script using the PHP5 CLI binary that monitors a directory for
changes, then updates a Network Server SQL Anywhere 8 database when a change
was detected. Idealy, my program would run indefinately, and issue odbc_connect
()/odbc_close() when appropriate. However, it seems that once connected, your
odbc session is limited to 30 seconds of active time, after which, the
connection becomes stale, and no further queries can be executed.  Instead, it
returns a generic "Authentication violation"  error from the odbc driver.

Here's an example:

<?php
  $conn=odbc_connect($connect_string,'','');
  $result=odbc_exec($qry,$conn);  //returns data
  sleep(31);
  $result=odbc_exec($qry,$conn);  //"Authentication Violation"
?>

Additionally, it seems that odbc_close() doesn't truely close the connection
(at least not using Network SQL Anywhere 8). The resource is no longer usable
after the odbc_close() is issued, but as far as the server is concerned, there
is still a connection present. The connection doesn't truely close until after
the php script has ended, which is unfortunate, because a subsequent
odbc_connect() commands appear to reuse the existing stale connection, which
was supposedly closed.

My workaround was to design my script exit entirely after a the database update
had completed.  I then called my script whithin a batch file and put it inside
an endless loop.

I'm not sure if this is a bug with PHP or what, but I thought I'd share in case
someone else is pulling their hair out trying to figure this one out...
===============================================================================

To connect to a SQL DB on a unix srv via odbc one can use one of the following
solutions.

1. having an odbc.ini (~/.odbc.ini)

[PostgreSQL]
Description         = PostgreSQL template1
Driver              = PostgreSQL
Trace               = Yes
TraceFile           = /tmp/odbc.log
Database            = PerfTest
Servername          = localhost
UserName            = boss
Password            = BigBoss
Port                = 5432
Protocol            = 6.4
ReadOnly            = Yes
ConnSettings        =

[Default]
Driver = /local/lib/libodbc.so

2. specifying a DSN

function DBCALL($SQL)
{       
$U = "boss";
$DB = "PerfTest";
$P = "BigBoss";
$Srv = "llocalhost";
$DSN = "Driver=PostgreSQL;Server=$Srv;Database=$DB";
       
echo "Trying to connect to $DSN\n";   
if ($CID = odbc_connect ("$DSN","$U","$P",SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC))
{
    echo "still trying CID = $CID\n";
    if ($RES = odbc_exec($CID, $SQL))
    {
        echo "RES = $RES\n";
        print_r($RES);
        echo "\n";
           
        $NR = odbc_num_rows($RES);

<snip>

Hope this helps.

Connect to an MS-Access Database on the Network via ODBC

Apache 2.0.47 with PHP 4.3.4 running on Windows XP Pro

If you encounter the error
"[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default
driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"

you should make sure to have the following done:

The ODBC-link must be a System-DNS and not a User-DNS. Configure your ODBC-link
and then modify your configuration with regedt32. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC_INI and open your ODBC-link. The field DBQ contains the path
to your database. This path must be without Drive-names (e. g. "M:") so change
it to "\\Server\folder\database.mdb". This setting is changed each time you
modify your ODBC-configuration using the Windows-tool, so make sure you do this
afterwards.

Then you go to the Services-Section in your Systemmanagement. Select the
properties of your Apache module. In the login-section you have to make sure
you login with a valid User-Account for your Network-Server.

Please note that this way you still have no permission to access linked tables
within the linked database

Funny enough all this is not necessary on Win98.
===============================================================================

If you encounter the error:

"[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default
driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"

Windows with PHP, running under IIS/PWS, PHP runs under the anonymous user,
INET_USR_"server" (were "server" is your servername).
This user has no read access in the ODBC System DSN tree in the registry.

With regedt32 open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC_INI and give read
access to every ODBC entry you want to use with PHP.

Beware: With every change to a ODBC system DSN, the rights on that ODBC system
DSN are gone again, and you have to change the rights again manualy.

Under Apache, PHP runs under the System account and you wont have this problem.
===============================================================================

Connecting with SQL in a ODBC source

2 ways, one is if your SQL server is runign in your machine

$ser="LOCALMACHINE"; #the name of the SQL Server
$db="mydatabase"; #the name of the database
$user="myusername"; #a valid username
$pass="my pass"; #a password for the username

# one line
$conn=odbc_connect("Driver={SQL Server};Server=".$ser.";Database=
".$db,$user,$pass);
# one line

the second way is if the SQL Server is runing in other machine but in the same
network

$ser="LOCALMACHINE"; #the name of the SQL Server
$db="mydatabase"; #the name of the database
$user="myusername"; #a valid username
$pass="my pass"; #a password for the username

#one line
$conn=odbc_connect("DRIVER=SQL Server;SERVER=".$ser.";UID=".$user.";PWD=
".$pass.";
DATABASE=".$db.";
Address=".$ser.",1433","","");
#one line
===============================================================================

Because the dsn needs to be system-wide, you will also need write access to the
registry to set it up.
===============================================================================

I fighted with the "Data source name not found and no
default driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"
error for a while trying to connect via ODBC to a SQL Server
2000. Finally I found this workaround:

$cn = odbc_connect("Driver={SQL Server};Server=MyServer;Database=MyDatabase",
"MyUser","MyPassword")

Change "MyServer", "MyDatabase", "MyUser" and "MyPassword" to the right values.

I guess that adding the "Integrated Security=YES" will work too.

===============================================================================

here's a quick note about using php and db2 that cost me a couple of hours and
several recompiles trying to figure out why it didn't work.

put the below line in any script

     putenv("DB2INSTANCE=db2inst1");

Or, set that in your webserver environment somehow.
===============================================================================

If you encounter the error:

"[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default
driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"

make sure you have the correct permission to your database file (e.g. if using
Win2k, might want to set the "Everyone" group to "Full Control").  For Windows,
I find that I have to sometimes use the registry editor (e.g. RegEdt32.exe) to
set the database file's permission because for some unknown reason, setting the
permission from the file's "Properties" option does not work.
===============================================================================

If you have problem to connect to sybase with an ODBC driver, try to set up
your SYBASE environment variable to the correct directory.
([ODBC SQL Server driver]Allocation of a Sybase Open Client Context failed)

Ex : Here is a connection to a DSN

putenv("SYBASE=c:\sybase");

$conn  =  odbc_connect("DSN1","USER","PASSWORD");
echo  "conn:  $conn";
if  ($conn  <=  0)  {
        echo  "Error  in  connection";
        exit;
} else  {
        echo  "<P>Connection  successful\n";
};
===============================================================================

Thought I'd add a note here on this. I'm using Apache 2.0.39 on Windows XP and
PHP 4.2.2.

It helps a lot if you don't use capital letters in your dsn string.

Thought I also comment on the posts about using system dsns over file dsns.
There are lots of posts saying use systems not files, but none (that I have
seen) which explain why.

Essentially: File DSNs are specific to the current user, therefore the Internet
Guest User Account doesn't have rights to them. Systems are available to
everyone.

Osiris :)

If you (still) get that annoying error like and you're using Access:

MSaccess DSN(Microsoft Jet engine couldn't open the database 'Unknow'.
Another user is using it exclusively, or you dont have permission to use
it).

Make sure your access *.mdb file is not on a network drive. Put it on C: or D:
disable all security first so you can test the connection. Once you can verify
that you can connect add appropriate passwords, group access, etc.

After going nuts for a while, I realized that my database name had a space in

everything worked fine.

We've tried hard to connect from php to our IBM DB2 RS/6000 Server. It worked
after we compiled with --ibm-db2= option, but it was unbelievable
slow.

No, just testing some options, we found out that it went from very slow
(getting 100 records lasts 1 till 10 seconds) to fast access (almost same speed
as with using JDBC from Servlets) to 0.2 till 0.3 seconds.

We simply added the optional parameter Cursortype to odbc_connect, and with the
cursortype SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC it changed in that way!

Hope this helps anybody who must connect to db2 ;)
===============================================================================

If you don't want to specify your login credentials on your web server, you can
leave the login fields blank to use the integrated windows security like here:

odbc_connect("DSN=DataSource","","");

Make sure you have switched your system dsn to integrated security, too !

(works on windows machines only, of course)

flo.
===============================================================================

If like me you are using openlink from unix to access an MS Access database on
an NT/Win2k machine and find out that your INSERT queries don't do anything and
don't report any errors, use odbc_pconnect().

I couldn't understand what was going on and after a bit of research I found out
that with MySQL they recommended using mysql_pconnect() for INSERT queries. I
tried the same thing with odbc and it worked.
===============================================================================

If you're connecting to a SQL server database through ODBC, you must set the
default database of the ODBC DSN to the database you want to use.

There is no way to specify the database name in odbc_connect or odbc_pconnect,
just the DSN name, username, and password.
===============================================================================

If using Openlink to connect to a Microsoft Access database, you will most
likely fine tha odbd_connect() works fine, but discover that ANY query will
produce odd results; with SELECT queries failing with "[OpenLink][ODBC][Driver]
Driver not capable, SQL state
S1C00 in SQLExecDirect in xxxx.php on line xx" and INSERT / DELETE queries
warning "No tuples available at this result index".

In this case, use the SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC cursor!

This had me stumped for quite some time; because it was the odbc_exec() which
was seemingly at fault... :)

This might be obvious to some, but here is a quick tidbit that might save you
some time if you're using FreeTDS in Linux:

Be sure that you have these two lines in freetds.conf:
dump file = /tmp/freetds.log
dump file append = yes

so you can tail -f it in the background of debugging the problem.  This helped
me find my issue on on CentOS Linux: 

1) tsql test works
2) isql test works
3) odbc connection in php also works WHEN RUN FROM THE SHELL
4) running PHP through apache does NOT work.

my /tmp/freetds.log file told me:
net.c:168:Connecting to MYDBSERVER port MYDBPORT
net.c:237:tds_open_socket: MYDBSERVER:MYDBPORT: Permission denied

and the answer was my firewall/SELinux was denying the Apache processes access
to connect to the remote MSSQL DB port, but my shell accounts were fine.

I also had a problem with this message: ([ODBC SQL Server driver]Allocation of

was a settings problem and I thought this might benefit others too.

In addition to putting a <?php putenv ("SYBASE=c:\sybase"); ?>  as described by
oottavi above, I also had so specify a locale by setting <?php putenv ("LC_ALL=
default"); ?>.

Even though my locale was already set to a valid one (en_US) I had to set this

For anyone having problems with WHERE clauses in their MS Access ODBC requests
here s what I found: SQL requests sent to Access must include quotes around the

outputs:

And works.

$sel =  SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE cust_id = cust1 ;
outputs:
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE cust_id = cust1
And doesn t work.

Here s the whole block of code:
$conn = odbc_connect("database1","","");
$sel = "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE cust_id = 'cust1'";
$exec = odbc_exec($conn,$sel);
while($row = (odbc_fetch_array($exec)))

For three days I fought to be able to connect our Linux intranet server to our

thought would work but I still got a: odbc_connect(): SQL error: Missing server
name, port, or database name in call to CC_connect., SQL state IM002 in
SQLConnect

Note that isql was working great but php was failing to connect.

The solution:
I located and found a PHP module called php-unixODBC (to oppose with php-odbc).
Once installed (even though it wasn't for the right version of PHP), I realised
it didn't place the file properly. The ini file was in /etc/php/ instead of /
etc/php.d/, so I moved it there and renamed the old /etc/php.d/36_odbc.ini to /
etc/php.d/36_odbc.ini.sav, so that I now had /etc/php.d/36_unixodbc.ini. I
restarted the httpd server and now I was able to access the as400.

A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE OF CAUTION FOR WINDOWS USERS DEVELOPING ON NON-NETWORKED
SYSTEMS

If like me you are developing on a stand-alone system (Windows XP professional
running IIS).  Make sure that the the folder your database resides in is
shared, otherwise you will get the following type of message:

If you have switched to a new Version of PHP (from 4.1 to 4.3) and at the same
time have upgraded your Apache server (from 1.x to 2.x) and suddenly get the
error:

"[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default
driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"

It may be because you have your ODBC connections listed (Control Panel | ODBC)
as User DSN rather than System DSN.  They need to be System DSN in order for
the PHP in the Apache service to access to them.
===============================================================================

Due to multiple requests, more for DSN-less connections:

<?php
$db_connection = new COM("ADODB.Connection");

$db_connstr = "DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; DBQ=". realpath("../
databases/database.mdb") ." ;DefaultDir=". realpath("../databases");
$db_connection->open($db_connstr);
$rs = $db_connection->execute("SELECT * FROM Table");
$rs_fld0 = $rs->Fields(0);
$rs_fld1 = $rs->Fields(1);
while (!$rs->EOF) {
  print "$rs_fld0->value $rs_fld1->value\n";
  $rs->MoveNext(); /* updates fields! */
}
$rs->Close();
$db_connection->Close();
?>

(Prints first 2 columns for each row.)
===============================================================================

After much testing, and I think supported by a comment I found in the code, I
have come to a disturbing conclusion: odbc_connect() in PHP4.04pl1 is really an
odbc_pconnect(), with all the implications for transaction scoping. 
Specifically, each time you call odbc_connect( "X", "" "" ), you will get the
same physical ODBC Connection, and odbc_commit() and odbc_rollback() will
affect all copies.  The only solution I could find was to use several different
DSNs to access the database.

[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default

If you keep running  into this on the 64 bit versions of windows, ie server
2008,  and none of the other solutions helped.

In a 64 bit windows server operating system, there are TWO odbc managers. When
you pull up the usual menu for the odbc / dsn system, it is for the 64 bit odbc
manager, and 32 bit applications (vb 6.0, PHP 5) will not work using these
dsn's.

This is where the 32 bit odbc manager is:

Connecting to ADS (Advantage Database Server) using Windows. When you setup
data source in ODBC Manager (PHP_SERVER) don't use a mapped drive in Database
or Data Dictionary Path, or you cannot connect:

Lets suppose that you share C:\ADS_SERVER\ADS as ADS.
Mapping to a drive X: in PHP_SERVER

Instead of:

X:\APP\DATA\APP.ADD

use UNC:

\\ADS_SERVER\ADS\APP\DATA\APP.ADD

if the ADS ODBC dialog don t let you to browse a Network Drive type it manually

Pls ensure that the MSAccess database format is ".mdb".
If it is ".accdb" it will not work!

I was having trouble connecting to a MSSQL database using FreeTDS and a DSN
string with the error message:
"Warning: odbc_connect(): SQL error: [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name
not found, and no default driver specified, SQL state IM002 in SQLConnect"

The problem was with specifying the driver. Many examples show the driver name
surrounded by { }

The solution was to remove the braces.

Example:
<?php
$user = "username";
$pass = "password";
// Some examples show "Driver={FreeTDS};" but this will not work
$dsn = "Driver=FreeTDS;Server=some.server.com;Port=1433;Database=mydatabase;";
$cx = odbc_connect($dsn,$user,$pass);
// Get the error message
if($cx === false) {
    throw new ErrorExcpetion(odbc_errormsg());
}
?>
===============================================================================

Once you've set up a UnixODBC connection to Informix (as described elsewhere,
for example in http://www.unixodbc.org/), the following PHP code will access a
database via its DSN:

<?php
// We must set these environment variables for Informix to work.  Either
// do it here or in php.ini.
putenv("INFORMIXDIR=/usr/share/informix");
putenv("ODBCINI=/usr/local/unixODBC/etc/odbc.ini");

// Open up a connection to the database.
if (!($con = odbc_connect("CollectOh", "", "")))
  echo "<p>Connection to CollectOh failed.</p>\n";
else
  {
  // Let's try enumerating all of the tables in the database (there ain't
  // no "show tables" here).
  if (($res = odbc_exec($con, "select * from SYSTABLES")))
    {
    echo "<p>\n";
    odbc_result_all($res);
    echo "</p>\n";
    }

  // Close up shop, like good dobies.
  odbc_close($con);

I found that on Windows I am able to connect to a FoxPro free table directory
on a password-protected mapped network drive without having a domain controller
(as posted in the solution below from harald).
Trying to connect to the mapped drive returned the error "tablename does not
exist."  The same code worked correctly if the ODBC resource was located
locally on my machine.

As a workaround, I specified the datasource explicitly in the connection, but
pointed the source at a shortcut to the same mapped directory:
<?php
$dsn = "Driver={Microsoft Visual FoxPro Driver};SourceType=DBF;SourceDB=c:\\
shortcut;Exclusive=NO;collate=Machine;NULL=NO;DELETED=NO;BACKGROUNDFETCH=NO;";
$conn=odbc_connect($dsn,"","");
?>
and the connection completed.  My guess is that the credentials needed to
access the drive weren't accessible to apache (I tried changing the user apache
ran as to no avail), and the shortcut put that responsibility on Windows.

how to solve Error SQL state S1009 connecting to an access database in a
network with odbc

1 - if you dont have access installed in your computer, you will need the
access driver for odbc conection...install with mdactypex (just for 32 bits)...
or AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe for 64bits

2 - give needed rights to a windows user profile to run as a service: Control
panel, Administrative tools, in the left treeview panel, select Local Security
Policies, User Rights Assignment, and in the right panel find and select 'Logon
as a service', right button click and properties-> Search and add the user User
in your computer you want to Apache use to login at service start

3 - Go to Windows Services admin, select Apache, edit properties, select login
tab, and set the previuos user you use (write his windows login password)

4- Use php code like this:
$user="your_db_user";
$password="your_db_password";

// Conexion Access con ODBC
// Important: (4 initial slashes!) \\\\network_path\dir_name\...
$mdbFilename='\\\\servidor\data\AccessBD.mdb';

$conn_access = odbc_connect("Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=
$mdbFilename", $user, $password);
===============================================================================

<?php
//create an instance of the ADO connection object
$conn = new COM ("ADODB.Connection") or die("Cannot start ADO");

//define connection string, specify database driver
$connStr = "PROVIDER=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source= c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
db\examples.mdb";
  $conn->open($connStr); //Open the connection to the database

//declare the SQL statement that will query the database
$query = "SELECT * FROM cars";

//execute the SQL statement and return records
$rs = $conn->execute($query);

$num_columns = $rs->Fields->Count();
echo $num_columns . "<br />";

for ($i=0; $i < $num_columns; $i++) {
    $fld[$i] = $rs->Fields($i);
}
echo "<table>";
while (!$rs->EOF)  //carry on looping through while there are records
{
    echo "<tr>";
    for ($i=0; $i < $num_columns; $i++) {
        echo "<td>" . $fld[$i]->value . "</td>";
    }
    echo "</tr>";
    $rs->MoveNext(); //move on to the next record
}
echo "</table>";
//close the connection and recordset objects freeing up resources
$rs->Close();
$conn->Close();
$rs = null;
$conn = null;

This is the typical solution with the steps to follow if someone wants to
connect MS Access to PHP. it took me a couple of hours actually till i reached
it. i just wanted to ease the hassle for my colleagues in order not to waste
their time as i did. this is the duty of every programmer towards his/her peers
:p
here you are the CAKE :)

<?php

// to have this working:
// 1- u  have first to creat ur access database using MS
//     Access  (i asume u know how to do this). My database
//     that i used in my example is called "Questionaire.mdb".
//     the table in it is called "Results"
//
// 2- then u have to add this database to ODBC in the
//     control panel.
//
// 3- the adition happens by adding "MS Access Driver" to the
//     "System DNS" tab in ODBC Data Source Administrator. if
//     u have that "MS Access Driver" in "User DNS" tab, then
//     u have to delete it.
//
// 4- click on Add in the "System DNS" tab.
//
// 5- choose "MS Access Driver" from the "Creat New
//     Database Source" window and click finish.
//
// 6- then the "ODBC MS Access Setup" window will pop-up.
//
// 7- give the driver the name that you want to use in your
//     PHP scripting. i used here "MSAccessDriver".

// 8- after this, choose the "Select" button in "ODBC MS
//     Access Setup" to set the path of your Access database.
//
// 9-then u r done!!

// this odbc_connect does the connection to the driver i
// created in the ODBC Administrator
$con = odbc_connect('MSAccessDriver','',''); 

if ($con)
{
  echo "odbc connected<br>";
  $sql =  "select * from Results";

  //this function will execute the sql satametn in  
  //correspondance to the table in the db
  $exc = odbc_exec($con,$sql);  
}
else
  echo "odbc not connected<br>";

if($exc)
{
  echo "selection completed<br>";
  while($row = odbc_fetch_row($exc) )
       echo $row->id."<br>";
}
else
  echo "selection failed<br>";
       
?>

While Installing PHP  + Apache + DB2 some time it give problem with
odbc_connect(). . to solve this problem

make sure that u have made following entry in /etc/ld.so.conf

/usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/lib
/usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/include
/usr/lib

please add following line on line no 25 in /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd

./home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile
(i.e /home/(instant name)/sqllib/db2profile

for more detail please visit to IBM site

it will work
===============================================================================

To connect to a PROGRESS database using ODBC you must have SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC  as
the 4th parameter eg odbc_connect(DSN,uname,password,SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC )
otherwise you can pass queries but no results are ever returned .
===============================================================================

It is indeed possible to read the data stored in an MSAccess .mdb file while
remaining entirely within Linux. It is thanks to the mdbtools project, which
created an MDB driver for unix.

Up to you to get PHP to move this data around. Here are the links to get you
started:

Documentation:
ftp://kalamazoolinux.org/pub/pdf/dbaccess.pdf

ODBC on Linux:
http://www.unixodbc.org/

MDB driver for the odbc system created above:
http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/

Note that on most modern Linux boxen, you can bypass the (documented)
command-line configuration and installation of these projects; simply use
apt-get or some similar package installer.

The documentation link covers more than the mdb driver and is a good place to
start for all data access in Linux. Much thanks to the hard work which went
into these three projects.

I've been having trouble displaying Russian characters from Access database
using ODBC. You might try this solution, though it is using ADODB.Connection
COM connection with added charset setting.

<?php
$db_connection = new COM("ADODB.Connection", NULL, 1251);
$db_connstr = "DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; DBQ=C:\DataDir\
Employee.mdb;DefaultDir=C:\DataDir";

$db_connection->open($db_connstr);
$rs = $db_connection->execute("SELECT EmpNameLocal, EmpPosLocal FROM
tbl_Employee WHERE ID='$IDNo'");
$rs_fld0 = $rs->Fields(0);
$rs_fld1 = $rs->Fields(1);
while (!$rs->EOF) {
    $empNameLoc    = $rs_fld0->value;
    $empWPPos    = $rs_fld1->value;
    $rs->MoveNext();
}

$rs->Close();
$db_connection->Close();

odbc_connect("DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; DBQ=" . str_replace("/

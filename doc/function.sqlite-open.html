(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_open — Opens an SQLite database and create the database if it does not
exist

说明

resource sqlite_open ( string $filename [, int $mode = 0666 [, string &
$error_message ]] )

面向对象风格 (constructor):

final public SQLiteDatabase::__construct ( string $filename [, int $mode = 0666
[, string &$error_message ]] )

Opens an SQLite database or creates the database if it does not exist.

参数

filename

    The filename of the SQLite database. If the file does not exist, SQLite
    will attempt to create it. PHP must have write permissions to the file if
    data is inserted, the database schema is modified or to create the database
    if it does not exist.

mode

    The mode of the file. Intended to be used to open the database in read-only
    mode. Presently, this parameter is ignored by the sqlite library. The
    default value for mode is the octal value 0666 and this is the recommended
    value.

error_message

    Passed by reference and is set to hold a descriptive error message
    explaining why the database could not be opened if there was an error.

返回值

Returns a resource (database handle) on success, FALSE on error.

范例

Example #1 sqlite_open() example

<?php
if ($db = sqlite_open('mysqlitedb', 0666, $sqliteerror)) { 
    sqlite_query($db, 'CREATE TABLE foo (bar varchar(10))');
    sqlite_query($db, "INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('fnord')");
    $result = sqlite_query($db, 'select bar from foo');
    var_dump(sqlite_fetch_array($result)); 
} else {
    die($sqliteerror);
}
?>

注释

Tip

On Unix platforms, SQLite is sensitive to scripts that use the fork() system
call. If you do have such a script, it is recommended that you close the handle
prior to forking and then re-open it in the child and/or parent. For more
information on this issue, see » The C language interface to the SQLite library
in the section entitled Multi-Threading And SQLite.

Tip

It is not recommended to work with SQLite databases mounted on NFS partitions.
Since NFS is notoriously bad when it comes to locking you may find that you
cannot even open the database at all, and if it succeeds, the locking behaviour
may be undefined.

    Note: Starting with SQLite library version 2.8.2, you can specify :memory:
    as the filename to create a database that lives only in the memory of the
    computer. This is useful mostly for temporary processing, as the in-memory
    database will be destroyed when the process ends. It can also be useful
    when coupled with the ATTACH DATABASE SQL statement to load other databases
    and move and query data between them.

    Note: SQLite is 安全模式 and open_basedir aware.

===============================================================================

the above example dows not! work since sqlite_query() does not accept one
argument, but only 2.

so correct is:

<?php
if ($db = sqlite_open('mysqlitedb', 0666, $sqliteerror)) {
  sqlite_query($db,'CREATE TABLE foo (bar varchar(10))');
  sqlite_query($db,"INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('fnord')");
  $result = sqlite_query($db,'select bar from foo');
  var_dump(sqlite_fetch_array($result));
} else {
  die ($sqliteerror);
}
?>
===============================================================================

If you miss to set the permissions mentioned by ivoras Sqlite will drop an
error message saying "Malformed database scheme", which is somehow misleading.

(I mentioned this as some [I did] might search php.net for this error message)
===============================================================================

This function only support database of SQLite 2 or below. For SQLite 3, you
must use PDO.

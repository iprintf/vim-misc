MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument

(PECL mongo >=1.5.0)

MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument — Create a new command cursor from an
existing command response document

Description

public static MongoCommandCursor MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument ( 
MongoClient $connection , string $hash , array $document )

Use this method if you have a raw command result with cursor information in it.
Note that cursors created with this method cannot be iterated multiple times,
as they will lack the original command necessary for re-execution.

Parameters

connection

    Database connection.

hash

    The connection hash, as obtained through the third by-reference argument to
    MongoDB::command().

document

    Document with cursor information in it. This document needs to contain the
    id, ns and firstBatch fields. Such a document is obtained by calling the 
    MongoDB::command() with appropriate arguments to return a cursor, and not
    just an inline result. See the example below.

Return Values

Returns the new cursor.

Examples

Example #1 MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument()

<?php
$m = new MongoClient;
$d = $m->demo;

// Define the aggregation pipeline
$pipeline = [
    [ '$group' => [
        '_id' => '$country_code',
        'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
    ] ],
    [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
];

// Execute the command. The "cursor" option instructs the server to return
// cursor information in the response instead of inline results.
$r = $d->command(
    [
        'aggregate' => 'cities',
        'pipeline' => $pipeline,
        'cursor' => [ 'batchSize' => 1 ],
    ],
    null,
    $hash
);

// Show result and hash
var_dump( $r, $hash );

// Construct the command cursor
$cursor = MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument( $m, $hash, $r );
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

array(2) {
  ["cursor"]=>
  array(3) {
    ["id"]=>
    object(MongoInt64)#5 (1) {
      ["value"]=>
      string(12) "392143983421"
    }
    ["ns"]=>
    string(11) "demo.cities"
    ["firstBatch"]=>
    array(1) {
      [0]=>
      array(2) {
        ["_id"]=>
        string(2) "AD"
        ["timezones"]=>
        array(1) {
          [0]=>
          string(14) "Europe/Andorra"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ["ok"]=>
  float(1)
}
string(25) "localhost:27017;-;.;17617"

As you can see, the returned cursor information has the id, ns and firstBatch
fields.

EvPeriodic::at — Returns the absolute time that this watcher is supposed to
trigger next

说明

public double EvPeriodic::at ( void )

When the watcher is active, returns the absolute time that this watcher is
supposed to trigger next. This is not the same as the offset argument to 
EvPeriodic::set() or EvPeriodic::__construct() , but indeed works even in
interval mode.

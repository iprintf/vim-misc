EvWatcher::clear — Clear watcher pending status

说明

public int EvWatcher::clear ( void )

If the watcher is pending, this method clears its pending status and returns
its revents bitset(as if its callback was invoked). If the watcher isn't
pending it does nothing and returns 0 .

Sometimes it can be useful to "poll" a watcher instead of waiting for its
callback to be invoked, which can be accomplished with this function.

参数

此函数没有参数。

返回值

In case if the watcher is pending, returns revents bitset as if the watcher
callback had been invoked. Otherwise returns 0 .

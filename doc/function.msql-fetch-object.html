msql_fetch_object — Fetch row as object

说明

object msql_fetch_object ( resource $result )

msql_fetch_object() is similar to msql_fetch_array(), with one difference - an
object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can
only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are
illegal property names).

Speed-wise, the function is identical to msql_fetch_array(), and almost as
quick as msql_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).

参数

result

    resource 型的结果集。此结果集来自对 msql_query() 的调用。

返回值

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

范例

Example #1 msql_fetch_object() example

<?php
$con = msql_connect();
if (!$con) {
    die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
}

if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
    die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
}

$result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
if (!$result) {
    die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
}

while ($row = msql_fetch_object($result, MSQL_ASSOC)) {
    echo $row->id . ': ' . $row->name . "\n";
}

msql_free_result($result);
?>

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.0.4 A bug was fixed when retrieving data from columns containing NULL values.
      Such columns were not placed into the resulting array.

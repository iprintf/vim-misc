HaruPage::measureText — Calculate the byte length of characters which can be
included on one line of the specified width

说明

int HaruPage::measureText ( string $text , float $width [, bool $wordwrap =
false ] )

Get the byte length of characters which can be included on one line of the
specified width.

参数

text

    The text to measure.

width

    The width of the line.

wordwrap

    When this parameter is set to TRUE the function "emulates" word wrapping by
    stopping after the last full word (delimited by whitespace) that can fit on
    the line.

返回值

Returns the byte length of characters which can be included within the
specified width. For single-byte encodings, this is equal to the number of
characters. For multi-byte encodings, this is not necessarily the case.

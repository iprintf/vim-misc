xdiff_string_rabdiff — Make binary diff of two strings using the Rabin's
polynomial fingerprinting algorithm

说明

string xdiff_string_bdiff ( string $old_data , string $new_data )

Makes a binary diff of two strings and returns the result. The difference
between this function and xdiff_string_bdiff() is different algorithm used
which should result in faster execution and smaller diff produced. This
function works with both text and binary data. Resulting patch can be later
applied using xdiff_string_bpatch()/xdiff_file_bpatch().

For more details about differences between algorithm used please check
» libxdiff website.

参数

old_data

    First string with binary data. It acts as "old" data.

new_data

    Second string with binary data. It acts as "new" data.

返回值

Returns string with binary diff containing differences between "old" and "new"
data or FALSE if an internal error occurred.

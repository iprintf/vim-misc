GearmanWorker::addFunction — Register and add callback function

说明

public bool GearmanWorker::addFunction ( string $function_name , callable
$function [, mixed &$context [, int $timeout ]] )

Registers a function name with the job server and specifies a callback
corresponding to that function. Optionally specify extra application context
data to be used when the callback is called and a timeout.

参数

function_name

    The name of a function to register with the job server

function

    A callback that gets called when a job for the registered function name is
    submitted

context

    A reference to arbitrary application context data that can be modified by
    the worker function

timeout

    An interval of time in seconds

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 Simple worker making use of extra application context data

<?php

# get a gearman worker
$worker= new GearmanWorker(); 

# add the default server (localhost)
$worker->addServer(); 

# define a variable to hold application data
$count= 0; 

# add the "reverse" function
$worker->addFunction("reverse", "reverse_cb", $count);

# start the worker
while ($worker->work());

function reverse_cb($job, &$count) 
{ 
  $count++; 
  return "$count: " . strrev($job->workload()); 
} 

?>

Running a client that submits two jobs for the reverse function would have
output similar to the following:

1: olleh
2: dlrow

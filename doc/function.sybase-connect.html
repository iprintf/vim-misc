sybase_connect

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sybase_connect — Opens a Sybase server connection

说明

resource sybase_connect ([ string $servername [, string $username [, string
$password [, string $charset [, string $appname [, bool $new = false ]]]]]] )

sybase_connect() establishes a connection to a Sybase server.

In case a second call is made to sybase_connect() with the same arguments, no
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling sybase_close().

参数

servername

    The servername argument has to be a valid servername that is defined in the
    'interfaces' file.

username

    Sybase user name

password

    Password associated with username.

charset

    Specifies the charset for the connection

appname

    Specifies an appname for the Sybase connection. This allow you to make
    separate connections in the same script to the same database. This may come
    handy when you have started a transaction in your current connection, and
    you need to be able to do a separate query which cannot be performed inside
    this transaction.

new

    Whether to open a new connection or use the existing one.

返回值

Returns a positive Sybase link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.

更新日志

版本              说明
5.3.0 The new parameter was added.

===============================================================================

To connect from win32 to Sybase on Unix , you can use sybase open client and
make sure to use the hostname in sybase_connect as it is defined in the OC
sql.ini file .. it worked that way !
===============================================================================

If you are having trouble connecting to your sybase database on unix, try
checking that the SYBASE environmental variable is set correctly. I was getting
connection errors until I found out that this variable had not been set through
the server.
===============================================================================

To decrease the level of messages sent back from the dbserver (such as 'changed
context...') try:

     sybase_min_server_severity(11);
===============================================================================

freetds is a great, free tool to access your sybase tables with PHP. The setup
can be a bit tricky. Use the following to put the environment variables that
you need:
<?php
putenv ("SYBASE=/usr/local/freetds");
putenv ("SYBPLATFORM=linux");
putenv ("LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/freetds/lib");
putenv ("LC_ALL=default");
putenv ('PATH=\"/usr/local/freetds/bin:$PATH\"');
putenv ("DSQUERY=SYBASE");
?>
Even if not using freetds, you'll need those env vars to make any sybase
connection work. Another option is to just load them into your box from the
command line.

EventBuffer::copyout — Copies out specified number of bytes from the front of
the buffer

说明

public int EventBuffer::copyout ( string &$data , int $max_bytes )

Behaves just like EventBuffer::read() , but does not drain any data from the
buffer. I.e. it copies the first max_bytes bytes from the front of the buffer
into data . If there are fewer than max_bytes bytes available, the function
copies all the bytes there are.

参数

data

    Output string.

max_bytes

    The number of bytes to copy.

返回值

Returns the number of bytes copied, or -1 on failure.

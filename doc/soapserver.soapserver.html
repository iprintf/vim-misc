SoapServer::SoapServer — SoapServer constructor

说明

public SoapServer::SoapServer ( mixed $wsdl [, array $options ] )

This constructor allows the creation of SoapServer objects in WSDL or non-WSDL
mode.

参数

wsdl

    To use the SoapServer in WSDL mode, pass the URI of a WSDL file. Otherwise,
    pass NULL and set the uri option to the target namespace for the server.

options

    Allow setting a default SOAP version (soap_version), internal character
    encoding (encoding), and actor URI (actor).

    The classmap option can be used to map some WSDL types to PHP classes. This
    option must be an array with WSDL types as keys and names of PHP classes as
    values.

    The typemap option is an array of type mappings. Type mapping is an array
    with keys type_name, type_ns (namespace URI), from_xml (callback accepting
    one string parameter) and to_xml (callback accepting one object parameter).

    The cache_wsdl option is one of WSDL_CACHE_NONE, WSDL_CACHE_DISK,
    WSDL_CACHE_MEMORY or WSDL_CACHE_BOTH.

    There is also a features option which can be set to SOAP_WAIT_ONE_WAY_CALLS
    , SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS, SOAP_USE_XSI_ARRAY_TYPE.

    The send_errors option can be set to FALSE to sent a generic error message
    ("Internal error") instead of the specific error message sent otherwise.

Here's my solution to make SOAP-headers based authentication.

1). First of all we define the decorator class for our service class:

<?php

class SOAP_Service_Secure
{
    protected $class_name    = '';
    protected $authenticated = false;

    // -----

    public function __construct($class_name)
    {
        $this->class_name = $class_name;

    }

    public function AuthHeader($Header)
    {
        if($Header->username == 'foo' && $Header->password == 'bar')
            $this->authenticated = true;

    }

    public function __call($method_name, $arguments)
    {
        if(!method_exists($this->class_name, $method_name))
            throw new Exception('method not found');

        $this->checkAuth();

        return call_user_func_array(array($this->class_name, $method_name), 
$arguments);

    }

    // -----

    protected function checkAuth()
    {
        if(!$this->authenticated)
            HTML_Output::error(403);

    }

}

?>

2). Then we pass an instance of it to the SoapServer object.

<?php

    $Service = new SOAP_Service_Secure('My_Service');

    $Server = new SoapServer('my-service.wsdl');

    $Server->setObject($Service);

    $Server->handle();

?>

3). Implementing a client:

<?php

class AuthHeader
{
    public $username;
    public $password;   
   
}

// -----

$Client = new SoapClient('http://example.com/my-service.wsdl', array(
    'exceptions' => true
));

// -----

$AuthHeader = new AuthHeader();

$AuthHeader->username = 'foo';
$AuthHeader->password = 'bar';

$Headers[] = new SoapHeader('http://example.com', 'AuthHeader', $AuthHeader);

$Client->__setSoapHeaders($Headers);

// -----

$Result = $Client->someMethod();

?>

As you can see SoapServer uses our decorator class to answer client requests.
If request contains "AuthHeader" SOAP-header then our wrapper checks the
credentials and sets $authenticated parameter to TRUE (on success). Then
SoapServer calls requested method on our wrapper, we are intercepting it with
__call(), checking authentication and if everything is allright we are calling
real method on the "My_Service" class.
===============================================================================

Calling a server from .NET:
If you intend to call a PHP SOAP server from a .NET Client, there are a couple
of things to be aware of. First of all, I've only got it working in WSDL mode.
If anyone have made it work in non-WSDL-mode, I'd be interested in hearing
that. In WSDL-mode it works, but both input and output-parameters are wrapped
from .NET.

Basically, a function with this signature:

<?php
function SomeFunction($param1, $param2)
{
   return $param1+$param2;
}
?>

Must be rewritten to this, without changing the WSDL:

<?php
function SomeFunction($data)
{
$valueArray = get_object_vars($data);
$param1 = $valueArray["param1"];
$param2 = $valueArray["param2"];
return Array("SomeFunctionResult" => $param1+$param2);
}
?>
===============================================================================

A general thing i've experienced with SOAP and which, for some reason, isn't
mentioned in ANY tutorials I've read, is this: The server tends to cache the
interface. This means that if you add a function you'll usually get errors that
the function doesn't exist.
If your SOAP server is written in PHP just delete the cache files, usually
located in /tmp, whenever you add a function, or modify the parameters. These
are named wsdl-******something******
I hope this will spare someone the grief I've experienced with this.
===============================================================================

Beware: in wsdl mode SoapServer does not properly validate if
request matches the given WSDL. It just skips invalid elements. http://
bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45966
===============================================================================

If you are getting an error about always_populate_raw_post_data or Can't find
HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA then it means the server isn't getting info from the (you
guessed!) raw post data.
Try doing something like this when coding your server:

<?php
$server = new SoapServer(null,array('uri' => "http://localhost/namespace"));
$server->setClass('myClass');
$data = file_get_contents('php://input');
$server->handle($data);
?>

Worked for me!
===============================================================================

In response to Timo, it is possible to access Soap Headers from the SoapServer
class and call methods to handle them. Rather than treat them seperately, they
are treated as part of the Soap request.

To pass approximately wss standard headers (note that I couldn't get attributes
from the header tags without text preprocessing, so standards compliance failed
me), first create the following class on the client:
<?php
/*
* Login credentials to be supplied as a SOAP header
* Class used to ensure Soap Head tags in correct format.
*/
class SoapHeaderUsernameToken
{
    /** @var int Password */
    public $Password;
    /** @var int Username */
    public $Username;
   
    public function __construct($l, $p)
    {
        $this->Password = $p;
        $this->Username = $l;
    }
}
?>

Now, set the Soap Headers:

<?php
    // Set the login headers
    $wsu = 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2002/07/utility';
    $usernameToken = new SoapHeaderUsernameToken($this->username, $this->
password);
    $soapHeaders[] = new SoapHeader($wsu, 'UsernameToken', $usernameToken);
?>

Next instantiate the client object, add the headers and make the call:

<?php
    $client = new SoapClient( $wsdl);
    $client->__setSoapHeaders( $soapHeaders );
    $client->__soapCall( $method, $params );
?>

Moving to the Server, you'll handle the Soap call somewhat like:
<?php
// Instantiate server with relevant wsdl & class.
$server = new SoapServer( 'mysoapwsdl.wsdl' );
$server->setClass(  'mysoapclass' );
$server->handle();
?>

The key here is that the headers will be handled first by the server which will
call the method mysoapclass::UsernameToken. The way we work this is the
UsernameToken method authenticates the username / password combo and sets a
protected class var. Then when the Soap Body is handled and the appropriate
class method called, a check is made at the start of callable method to ensure
authentication has been passed.

If the Soap auth header is missing, the soap body method will be called anyway
so the check is essential in case a malevolent client deliberately leaves the
headers off.

An example server class is below (missing various methods which I leave as an
exercise to the reader to provide):
<?php
class mysoapclass {
    /*
     * Authentication function
     * This is called by the Soap header of the same name. The function name is
a Ws-security standard auth tag
     * and corresponds to the header tag.
     *
     * @param string username
     * @param string password
     */
    public function UsernameToken( $username, $password ){
        // Store username for logging
        $this->Username = $username;

        $auth = new $this->AuthClass( $username, $password, get_class($this) );
        if( $auth->IsValid() ){
            $this->Authenticated = true;
        } else {
            $this->ThrowSoapFault( 'auth' );
        }
    }

    /*
     * Test method
     */
    public function felineResponse( $action ){

        // Place this at the start of every exposed method
        // This is because the SoapServer will attempt to call
        // if no authentication headers are passed.
        if(!$this->Authenticated){
            $this->ThrowSoapFault( 'auth' );
        }

        if( $action == 'stroke' ){
            return 'purr';
        } elseif( $action == 'tease' ){
            return 'hiss';
        }
    }

}
?>

This is a adaptation of stuff I found online somewhere...
===============================================================================

There is a option key 'send_errors' that can be use not to expose PHP (fatal)
error messages to the SoapFault message text.

If server is created with a 'send_errors' => false option provied, the
faultstring of the SoapFault thrown upon running into a PHP error would be a
generic “Internal Error” instead of e.g. “Class 'MySecretClass' not found.”.

Example:
$server = new SoapServer('http://path.to/my.wsdl', array('send_errors' =>
false));

The only place this is mentioned is in a discussion under the bug #42214.
However, it is not mentioned in the manual page, at least not at the time of
writing this note.
===============================================================================

typemap isn't very well documented at all, but I thought I might be able to use
it to clean some things up and map between object fields and XML attributes
that have different names but are conceptually the same thing.

Unfortunately type map works at the object level, not the field level like I
was hoping, requiring you to provide functions for building the entire object
from an XML string (using the XML parser of your choice) and vice versa.  I
found the wording of the docs very confusing, both parameters are strings which
are function names.

the to_xml function will take the object as a parameter and return a string,
the from_xml function will take an xml string as a parameter and should return
an object of the correct type.

Both methods can also throw SOAPFaults or other exceptions which can be caught
from the actual client method call ($client->someRemoteMethod())

There are decent usage examples in the PHP build tests:  http://cvs.php.net/
viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/soap/tests/?diff_format=u
The typemap tests are at the bottom.
===============================================================================

While others may not do what I did, I thought if my WSDL was not local and
needed to be grabbed via HTTP, I should set the $wsdl var in __construct() to
NULL, and set the 'uri' value in the additional parameters.

This does enable non-WSDL mode, which only causes problems when using complex
types.  Since your complex types are not respected/imported, you get unexpected
problems out the wazoo.

So if you are exposing your class via "setClass" to the SOAP server and for
some reason your "types" aren't being returned, you can do this:

<?php
$server = new SoapServer('http://soap.example.com/genwsdl.php?api');
$server->setClass('myClass'); // previously included or defined
$server->handle();
?>

This is NOT correct:
<?php
$server = new SoapServer(NULL, array('uri' => 'http://soap.example.com/
genwsdl.php?api'));
?>

I sure wish someone really smart would go into a bit more detail in this
documentation of the SoapServer options, why they exist, when to use them,
etc.  I find the SOAP docs lacking polish.
===============================================================================

Things that I've searched a lot for that might be useful to somebody:

If you are using Zend Studio, you can easily generate a wsdl file using the
WSDL Generator if you document your code using PHPDOC.

One thing a lot of people are searching everywhere, is the way to pass/return
an array of variables... In your PHPDOC block use the [] after the variable
name like this

<?php
class SoapServer {
  /**
   * This is My Soap Server
   * @param integer[] $a
   * @param string[] $b
   * @param bar[] $c
  */
  public function foo ($a, $b, $c){
  }
}
?>
This way, the function will require an array of integers for $a, an array of
strings for $b and an array of objets of Class "bar" for $c

In the WSDL, you'll find something like this

<xsd:complexType name="barArray">
  <xsd:complexContent>
    <xsd:restriction base="soapenc:Array">
      <xsd:attribute ref="soapenc:arrayType" wsdl:arrayType="typens:bar[]"/>
    </xsd:restriction>
  </xsd:complexContent>
</xsd:complexType>
<xsd:complexType name="bar">
  <xsd:all>
    <xsd:element name="var1" type="xsd:boolean"/>
    <xsd:element name="var2" type="xsd:integer"/>
    <xsd:element name="var3" type="xsd:string"/>
  </xsd:all>
</xsd:complexType>

I didn't define anywhere the barArray type, Zend's WSDL Generator generated it
automatically...

If you are not using Zend you can generate the wsdl file manually.

Hope it helps someone
===============================================================================

only complementing Juamei answer, the header is passed to UsernameToken method
as an object with 2 properties Username and Password.
===============================================================================

In response to jas [at] dansupport (dot) dk:

All you need to do is disable wsdl caching like so:

ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", "0");

Then you don't need to delete any cache files.
===============================================================================

It is currently not possible to process soap headers from within a SoapServer
instance. If soap headers are specified within a WSDL file, you have to extract
the headers manually from the request.

For more information please see http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38309
===============================================================================

The SoapServer can not generate WSDL's yet. (PHP 5.3.5)
It'll exit with "SOAP-ENV:ServerWSDL generation is not supported yet"
===============================================================================

If you're running $soapServer->handle() and getting an empty server response
and no errors (even in the logs), check if you're instantiating the SOAP server
like this:

<?php
$soapServer = new SoapServer('http://www.example.com/soap/endpoint?wsdl');
//...
$soapServer->handle(); // Result: Empty response
?>

Instantiating the SOAP server with one the following should fix it:

<?php
// With slash before ?wsdl:
$soapServer = new SoapServer('http://www.example.com/soap/endpoint/?wsdl');
// Or instantiate with the "uri" option, which works with or without the
trailing slash:
$soapServer = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => 'http://www.example.com/soap/
endpoint?wsdl'));
$soapServer = new SoapServer(null, array('uri' => 'http://www.example.com/soap/
endpoint/?wsdl'));
?>

Hope that helps somebody! Zend_Soap_Server wasn't working for me, and I
eventually found that it had to do with the native PHP SOAP class (which ZF
uses).

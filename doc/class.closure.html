Closure 类

(PHP 5 >= 5.3.0, PHP 7)

简介

用于代表匿名函数的类.

匿名函数（在 PHP 5.3 中被引入）会产生这个类型的对象。在过去，这个类被认为是一个
实现细节，但现在可以依赖它做一些事情。自 PHP 5.4 起，这个类带有一些方法，允许在
匿名函数创建后对其进行更多的控制。

除了此处列出的方法，还有一个 __invoke 方法。这是为了与其他实现了 __invoke()魔术
方法的对象保持一致性，但调用匿名函数的过程与它无关。

类摘要

Closure {
/* 方法 */
__construct ( void )
public static Closure bind ( Closure $closure , object $newthis [, mixed
$newscope = 'static' ] )
public Closure bindTo ( object $newthis [, mixed $newscope = 'static' ] )
}

Table of Contents

  • Closure::__construct — 用于禁止实例化的构造函数
  • Closure::bind — 复制一个闭包，绑定指定的$this对象和类作用域。
  • Closure::bindTo — 复制当前闭包对象，绑定指定的$this对象和类作用域。

===============================================================================

This caused me some confusion a while back when I was still learning what
closures were and how to use them, but what is referred to as a closure in PHP
isn't the same thing as what they call closures in other languages (E.G.
JavaScript).

In JavaScript, a closure can be thought of as a scope, when you define a
function, it silently inherits the scope it's defined in, which is called its
closure, and it retains that no matter where it's used.  It's possible for
multiple functions to share the same closure, and they can have access to
multiple closures as long as they are within their accessible scope.

In PHP,  a closure is a callable class, to which you've bound your parameters
manually.

It's a slight distinction but one I feel bears mentioning.
===============================================================================

Scope
A closure encapsulates its scope, meaning that it has no access to the scope in
which it is defined or executed. It is, however, possible to inherit variables
from the parent scope (where the closure is defined) into the closure with the
use keyword:

function createGreeter($who) {
              return function() use ($who) {
                  echo "Hello $who";
              };
}

$greeter = createGreeter("World");
$greeter(); // Hello World

This inherits the variables by-value, that is, a copy is made available inside
the closure using its original name.

Small little trick. You can use a closures in itself via reference.

Example to delete a directory with all subdirectories and files:

<?php
$deleteDirectory = null;
$deleteDirectory = function($path) use (&$deleteDirectory) {
    $resource = opendir($path);
    while (($item = readdir($resource)) !== false) {
        if ($item !== "." && $item !== "..") {
            if (is_dir($path . "/" . $item)) {
                $deleteDirectory($path . "/" . $item);
            } else {
                unlink($path . "/" . $item);
            }
        }
    }
    closedir($resource);
    rmdir($path);
};
$deleteDirectory("path/to/directoy");
?>

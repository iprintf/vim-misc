(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

Ev::resume — Resume previously suspended default event loop

说明

final public static void Ev::resume ( void )

Ev::suspend() and Ev::resume() methods suspend and resume a loop
correspondingly.

All timer watchers will be delayed by the time spend between suspend and resume
, and all periodic watchers will be rescheduled(that is, they will lose any
events that would have occurred while suspended).

After calling Ev::suspend() it is not allowed to call any function on the given
loop other than Ev::resume() . Also it is not allowed to call Ev::resume()
without a previous call to Ev::suspend() .

Calling suspend / resume has the side effect of updating the event loop time
(see Ev::nowUpdate() ).

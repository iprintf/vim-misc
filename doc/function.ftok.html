ftok — Convert a pathname and a project identifier to a System V IPC key

说明

int ftok ( string $pathname , string $proj )

The function converts the pathname of an existing accessible file and a project
identifier into an integer for use with for example shmop_open() and other
System V IPC keys.

参数

pathname

    Path to an accessible file.

proj

    Project identifier. This must be a one character string.

返回值

On success the return value will be the created key value, otherwise -1 is
returned.

  • sem_get() - Get a semaphore id

Thanks to  daniele_dll@yahoo.it who got this in turn from linux glibc 2.3.2:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.shmop-open.php -- I'm putting this here
because it might be helpful to others.

function ftok($pathname, $proj_id) {
   $st = @stat($pathname);
   if (!$st) {
       return -1;
   }
 
   $key = sprintf("%u", (($st['ino'] & 0xffff) | (($st['dev'] & 0xff) << 16) |
(($proj_id & 0xff) << 24)));
   return $key;
}

Missing ftok() on Windows? Here's my little workaround:

<?php
if( !function_exists('ftok') )
{
    function ftok($filename = "", $proj = "")
    {
        if( empty($filename) || !file_exists($filename) )
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            $filename = $filename . (string) $proj;
            for($key = array(); sizeof($key) < strlen($filename); $key[] = ord(
substr($filename, sizeof($key), 1)));
            return dechex(array_sum($key));
        }
    }
}?>

NOTE: There *may* be duplicate keys, even if probability is low.

The key's were NOT computed like the original UNIX ftok() because i.e.
fileinode() is also missing on windows. Normally ftok() computes a key based on
the file inode and the system minor id of the harddrive the file resides.

Behaviour is like PHPs ftok(), -1 is returned if file is missing or $filename
is empty, computed int as hex on success.

The rather unintuitive usage of ftok with shm related functions like shmop_open
and shm_attach could simply be explained as a need to avoid shm key collisions.
Using ftok with a file that belongs to your project is likely to generate a
unique key. Additionally, using ftok with a file from your project avoids the
need to store the key so that other processes can access the segment because
ftok will always give you the same key if you pass the same file.
===============================================================================

As ftok uses only the last 16 bits of the inode of the file, you can get
collisions on large filesystems. Unfortunately, on large filesystems you can
get collisions rather quickly: if you have a collection of 350-400 files, odds
are that two of them have inodes with the same last 16 bits. So I've taken to
using fileinode instead of ftok with functions like shmop_open.

abk@avatartechnology.com has copied the code of daniele_dll@yahoo.it
But it is not correct.
The right version is here:
<?php
function ftok ($filePath, $projectId) {
    $fileStats = stat($filePath);
    if (!$fileStats) {
        return -1;
    }

    return sprintf('%u',
        ($fileStats['ino'] & 0xffff) | (($fileStats['dev'] & 0xff) << 16) | ((
ord($projectId) & 0xff) << 24)
    );
}
?>

The difference is that $projectId string should be used as ASCII value via ord
() function. Otherwise it will be interpreted as 0.
===============================================================================

If you're planning to use ftok() to generate an IPC identifier to share with
other applications, note that PHP uses the ASCII value of the proj parameter to
generate the key, not the proj (aka id) parameter itself.

The result of this is that if you're using "1" as the id on the PHP side,
you'll need to use 49 elsewhere.

This may not be the case under all OS's, but certainly is for FreeBSD which
requires the id parameter passed to ftok to be an int.

Also of note, ipcs and ipcrm are extremely useful for debugging SysV queues
etc.

You can always use chr() as an alternative.
===============================================================================

You dont have to use ftok() for specifying an System V IPC identifier, though
its a good thing to do so.

Passing a regular int to, e.g. msg_get_queue, will have the same effect aslong
as you use that value when reading/writing.

I use it for some minor tasks generating small queue's.

This function is not part neither of ext/sysvsem nor ext/sysvshm but comes with
the core functions of PHP (from ext/standard).

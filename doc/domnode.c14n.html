===============================================================================

When working with (malformed) HTML, you're probably better off using
DOMDocument's saveHTML() method instead. C14N() will attempt to make your HTML
valid XML, for example by converting <br> to <br></br>.

So instead of:
$html = $Node->C14N();

Use:
$html = $Node->ownerDocument->saveHTML( $Node );
===============================================================================

C14N() returns an empty string if the node is not included in the document
tree:
<?php
$d = new DOMDocument('1.0');
$d->loadXML('<foo></foo>');
$n = $d->createElement('bar');
var_dump($n->C14N());
$d->documentElement->appendChild($n);
var_dump($n->C14N());
?>
output:
string(0) ""
string(11) "<bar></bar>"
===============================================================================

Good to know:

<< Due to a known issue in XML canonicalization in PHP, processing large
metadata files in SimpleSAMLphp takes a big amount of resources, with that
amount growing approximately by the square of the number of entities in the
metadata set >>
https://simplesamlphp.org/metaprocessing

<< The C14N() function appears to have a runtime that is O(N^2) (or possibly
worse?) depending on input size, which means that it becomes very slow as the
input grows. For example, an input with around 196000 nodes takes about 290
seconds, while an input with 486000 nodes takes 2200 seconds. >>

We had the same issue with a 4.1 MB XML (105k lines). The sample code of
ticket  #53655 takes 1h36 minute to canonicalize it!

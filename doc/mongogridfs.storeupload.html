MongoGridFS::storeUpload — Stores an uploaded file in the database

说明

public mixed MongoGridFS::storeUpload ( string $name [, array $metadata ] )

参数

name

    The name of the uploaded file(s) to store. This should correspond to the
    file field's name attribute in the HTML form.

metadata

    Other metadata fields to include in the file document.

        Note:

        These fields may also overwrite those that would be created
        automatically by the driver, as described in the MongoDB core
        documentation for the » files collection. Some practical use cases for
        this behavior would be to specify a custom chunkSize or _id for the
        file.

        Note:

        The filename field will be populated with the client's filename (e.g.
        $_FILES['foo']['name']).

返回值

Returns the _id of the saved file document. This will be a generated MongoId
unless an _id was explicitly specified in the extra parameter.

    Note:

    If multiple files are uploaded using the same field name, this method will
    not return anything; however, the files themselves will still be processed.

错误／异常

Throws MongoGridFSException if there is an error reading the uploaded file(s)
or inserting into the chunks or files collections.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
1.2.5 Changed second parameter to an array of metadata. Pre-1.2.5, the second
      parameter was an optional string overriding the filename.

范例

Example #1 MongoGridFS::storeUpload() HTML form example

Suppose you have the following HTML form:

<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" />

    <label for="pic">Please upload a profile picture:</label>
    <input type="file" name="pic" id="pic" />

    <input type="submit" />
</form>

If you wanted to store the uploaded image in MongoDB, you could do the
following in the script handling the form submission:

<?php
$m = new MongoClient();
$gridfs = $m->selectDB('test')->getGridFS();

$gridfs->storeUpload('pic', array('username' => $_POST['username']));
?>

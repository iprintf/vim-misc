(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mktime — 取得一个日期的 Unix 时间戳

说明

int mktime ([ int $hour = date("H") [, int $minute = date("i") [, int $second =
date("s") [, int $month = date("n") [, int $day = date("j") [, int $year = date
("Y") [, int $is_dst = -1 ]]]]]]] )

根据给出的参数返回 Unix 时间戳。时间戳是一个长整数，包含了从 Unix 纪元（January
1 1970 00:00:00 GMT）到给定时间的秒数。

参数可以从右向左省略，任何省略的参数会被设置成本地日期和时间的当前值。

注释

    Note:

    As of PHP 5.1, when called with no arguments, mktime() throws an E_STRICT
    notice: use the time() function instead.

参数

hour

    小时数。 The number of the hour relative to the start of the day determined
    by month, day and year. Negative values reference the hour before midnight
    of the day in question. Values greater than 23 reference the appropriate
    hour in the following day(s).

minute

    分钟数。 The number of the minute relative to the start of the hour.
    Negative values reference the minute in the previous hour. Values greater
    than 59 reference the appropriate minute in the following hour(s).

second

    秒数（一分钟之内）。 The number of seconds relative to the start of the
    minute. Negative values reference the second in the previous minute. Values
    greater than 59 reference the appropriate second in the following minute
    (s).

month

    月份数。 The number of the month relative to the end of the previous year.
    Values 1 to 12 reference the normal calendar months of the year in
    question. Values less than 1 (including negative values) reference the
    months in the previous year in reverse order, so 0 is December, -1 is
    November, etc. Values greater than 12 reference the appropriate month in
    the following year(s).

day

    天数。 The number of the day relative to the end of the previous month.
    Values 1 to 28, 29, 30 or 31 (depending upon the month) reference the
    normal days in the relevant month. Values less than 1 (including negative
    values) reference the days in the previous month, so 0 is the last day of
    the previous month, -1 is the day before that, etc. Values greater than the
    number of days in the relevant month reference the appropriate day in the
    following month(s).

year

    年份数，可以是两位或四位数字，0-69 对应于 2000-2069，70-100 对应于
    1970-2000。在如今系统中普遍把 time_t 作为一个 32 位有符号整数的情况下，year
    的合法范围是 1901 到 2038 之间，不过此限制自 PHP 5.1.0 起已被克服了。

is_dst

    本参数可以设为 1，表示正处于夏时制时间（DST），0 表示不是夏时制，或者 -1（
    默认值）表示不知道是否是夏时制。如果未知，PHP 会尝试自己搞明白。这可能产生
    不可预知（但并非不正确）的结果。如果 PHP 运行的系统中启用了 DST 或者 is_dst
    设为 1，某些时间是无效的。例如 DST 自 2:00 生效，则所有处于 2:00 到 3:00 之
    间的时间都无效，mktime() 会返回一个未定义（通常为负）的值。某些系统（例如
    Solaris 8）的 DST 在午夜生效，则 DST 生效当天的 0:30 会被计算为前一天的
    23:30。

        Note:

        自 PHP 5.1.0 起，本参数已被废弃。应该使用新的时区处理特性来替代。

返回值

mktime() 根据给出的参数返回 Unix 时间戳。如果参数非法，本函数返回 FALSE（在 PHP
5.1 之前返回 -1）。

错误／异常

在每次调用日期/时间函数时，如果时区无效则会引发 E_NOTICE 错误，如果使用系统设定
值或 TZ 环境变量，则会引发 E_STRICT 或 E_WARNING 消息。参见 
date_default_timezone_set()。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.3.0 mktime() now throws E_DEPRECATED notice if the is_dst parameter is used.
5.1.0 is_dst 参数被废弃。出错时函数返回 FALSE 而不再是 -1。修正了本函数可以接受
      年月日参数全为零。
5.1.0 When called with no arguments, mktime() throws E_STRICT notice. Use the 
      time() function instead.
5.1.0 现在发布 E_STRICT 和 E_NOTICE 时区错误。

范例

Example #1 基本例子

<?php
// Set the default timezone to use. Available as of PHP 5.1
date_default_timezone_set('UTC');

// Prints: July 1, 2000 is on a Saturday
echo "July 1, 2000 is on a " . date("l", mktime(0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 2000));

// Prints something like: 2006-04-05T01:02:03+00:00
echo date('c', mktime(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2006));
?>

Example #2 mktime() 例子

mktime() 在做日期计算和验证方面很有用，它会自动计算超出范围的输入的正确值。例如
下面例子中每一行都会产生字符串 "Jan-01-1998"。

<?php
echo date("M-d-Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 32, 1997));
echo date("M-d-Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 13, 1, 1997));
echo date("M-d-Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1998));
echo date("M-d-Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 98));
?>

Example #3 下个月的最后一天

任何给定月份的最后一天都可以被表示为下个月的第 "0" 天，而不是 -1 天。下面两个例
子都会产生字符串 "The last day in Feb 2000 is: 29"。

<?php
$lastday = mktime(0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2000);
echo strftime("Last day in Feb 2000 is: %d", $lastday);
$lastday = mktime(0, 0, 0, 4, -31, 2000);
echo strftime("Last day in Feb 2000 is: %d", $lastday);
?>

注释

Caution

在 PHP 5.1.0 之前，在任何已知 Windows 版本以及一些其它系统下不支持负的时间戳。
因此年份的有效范围限制为 1970 到 2038。

===============================================================================

Do remember that, counter-intuitively enough, the arguments for month and day
are inversed (or middle-endian). A common mistake for Europeans seems to be to
feed the date arguments in the expected order (big endian or little endian).

It's clear to see where this weird order comes from (even with the date being
big endian the order for all arguments would still be mixed - it's obviously
based on the American date format with the time "prefixed" to allow an easier
shorthand) and why this wasn't changed (passing the values in the wrong order
produces a valid, though unexpected, result in most cases), but it continues to
be a source of confusion for me whenever I come back to PHP from other
languages or libraries.
===============================================================================

Just a small thing to think about if you are only trying to pull the month out
using mktime and date.  Make sure you place a 1 into day field.  Otherwise you
will get incorrect dates when a month is followed by a month with less days
when the day of the current month is higher then the max day of the month you
are trying to find.. (Such as today being Jan 30th and trying to find the month
Feb.)
===============================================================================

Be careful passing zeros into mktime, in most cases a zero will count as the
previous unit of time. The documentation explains this yet most of the comments
here still use zeroes.

For example, if you pass the year 2013 into mktime, with zeroes for everything
else, the outcome is probably not what you are looking for.

<?php
echo date('F jS, Y g:i:s a', mktime(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2013));
// November 30th, 2012 12:00:00 am
?>

Instead of using 0's, try 1's. This makes more sense (except for minutes/
seconds). Maybe not as obvious of a purpose as zeroes to other programmers,
though.

<?php
echo date('F jS, Y g:i:s a', mktime(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2013));
// January 1st, 2013 1:01:01 am
?>
===============================================================================

It seems mktime() doesn't return negative timestamps on Linux systems with a
version of glibc <= 2.3.3.
===============================================================================

I was using the following to get a list of month names.

for ($i=1; $i<13; $i++) {
  echo date('F', mktime(0,0,0,$i) . ",";
}

Normally this outputs -
January,February,March,April,May,June,July,August,
September,October,November,December

However if today's date is the 31st you get instead:
January,March,March,May,May,July,July,August,October,
October,December,December

Why? Because Feb,Apr,June,Sept, and Nov don't have 31 days!

The fix, add the 5th parameter, don't let the day of month default to today's
date:

  echo date('F', mktime(0,0,0,$i,1) . ",";
===============================================================================

You cannot simply subtract or add month VARs using mktime to obtain previous or
next months as suggested in previous user comments (at least not with a DD > 28
anyway).

If the date is 03-31-2007, the following yeilds March as a previous month. Not
what you wanted.

<?php
$dateMinusOneMonth = mktime(0, 0, 0, (3-1), 31,  2007 );
$lastmonth = date("n | F", $dateMinusOneMonth);
echo $lastmonth;    //---> 3 | March
?>

mktime correctly gives you back the 3rd of March if you subtract 1 month from
March 31 (there are only 28 days in Feb 07).

If you are just looking to do month and year arithmetic using mktime, you can
use general days like 1 or 28 to do stuff like this:

<?php
$d_daysinmonth = date('t', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,1,$myYear));     // how many
days in month
$d_year = date('Y', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,1,$myYear));        // year
$d_isleapyear = date('L', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,1,$myYear));    // is YYYY a
leapyear?

$d_firstdow = date('w', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,'1',$myYear));     // FIRST falls
on what day of week (0-6)
$d_firstname = date('l', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,'1',$myYear));     // FIRST
falls on what day of week Full Name

$d_month = date('n', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,28,$myYear));         // month of
year (1-12)
$d_monthname = date('F', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,28,$myYear));         // Month
Long name (July)
$d_month_previous = date('n', mktime(0,0,0,($myMonth-1),28,$myYear));         /
/ PREVIOUS month of year (1-12)
$d_monthname_previous = date('F', mktime(0,0,0,($myMonth-1),28,$myYear));     /
/ PREVIOUS Month Long name (July)
$d_month_next = date('n', mktime(0,0,0,($myMonth+1),28,$myYear));         //
NEXT month of year (1-12)
$d_monthname_next = date('F', mktime(0,0,0,($myMonth+1),28,$myYear));         /
/ NEXT Month Long name (July)
$d_year_previous = date('Y', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,28,($myYear-1)));        //
PREVIOUS year
$d_year_next = date('Y', mktime(0,0,0,$myMonth,28,($myYear+1)));        // NEXT
year

$d_weeksleft = (52 - $d_weekofyear);                     // how many weeks left
in year
$d_daysinyear = $d_isleapyear ? 366 : 365;                // set correct days
in year for leap years
$d_daysleft = ($d_daysinyear - $d_dayofyear);                // how many days
left in year
?>
===============================================================================

Add (and subtract) unixtime:

<?php
function utime_add($unixtime, $hr=0, $min=0, $sec=0, $mon=0, $day=0, $yr=0) {
  $dt = localtime($unixtime, true);
  $unixnewtime = mktime(
      $dt['tm_hour']+$hr, $dt['tm_min']+$min, $dt['tm_sec']+$sec,
      $dt['tm_mon']+1+$mon, $dt['tm_mday']+$day, $dt['tm_year']+1900+$yr);
  return $unixnewtime;
}
?>
===============================================================================

The maximum possible date accepted by mktime() and gmmktime() is dependent on
the current location time zone.

For example, the 32-bit timestamp overflow occurs at
2038-01-19T03:14:08+0000Z.  But if you're in a UTC -0500 time zone (such as EST
in North America), the maximum accepted time before overflow (for older PHP
versions on Windows) is 2038-01-18T22:14:07-0500Z, regardless of whether you're
passing it to mktime() or gmmktime().
===============================================================================

Function to generate array of dates between two dates (date range array)

<?php
function dates_range($date1, $date2)
{
   if ($date1<$date2)
   {
       $dates_range[]=$date1;
       $date1=strtotime($date1);
       $date2=strtotime($date2);
       while ($date1!=$date2)
       {
           $date1=mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m", $date1), date("d", $date1)+1, date(
"Y", $date1));
           $dates_range[]=date('Y-m-d', $date1);
       }
   }
   return $dates_range;
}

echo '<pre>';

Pay attention that not all days have the same number of seconds (86400s) if you
are using date_default_timezone_set(..) and the used timezone has Daylight
Saving Time (DST) e.g. "Europe/Berlin". Under PHP 5.5.16 I get the following
results:

  $shortday  = mktime(23,59,59, '3','29','2015') - mktime(0,0,0,
'3','29','2015) + 1; // result: 82800s  (86400s - 3600s)
  $normalDay = mktime(23,59,59, '1', '2','2015') - mktime(0,0,0, '1',
'1','2015) + 1; // result: 86400s 
  $longDay   = mktime(23,59,59,'10','25','2015') - mktime
(0,0,0,'10','25','2015) + 1; // result: 90000s  (86400s + 3600s)

Pitfall is noticeable if you are running an iterative loop with a code like:
   echo date( 'd.m.Y', $day );
   $day = $day + 86400;   // 86400 = 24*3600 - frequently used in PHP code

which results in wrong date if $day reaches 2015-10-25 (end of summer time in
Germany):
    24.10.2015
    25.10.2015  
    25.10.2015   // Ups! Same date twice in calendar
    27.10.2015

You may workaround this by using date_default_timezone_set('UTC') where all
days have the same number of seconds.
===============================================================================

Please mind function is timezone dependent. Timezone independent funciton is

One practical and useful example of using negative values in mktime is the
following:

<?php
//Considering today's date
echo date('Y-m-d'); //Prints: 2016-03-22
echo date('Y-m-d', mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m"), date("d")-42, date("Y"))); //
Prints: 2016-02-09
?>

By using date outputs inside mktime and adding or subtracting from them may be
simpler than using other methods (string concatenations or timestamp values)
and less prone to human calculations' errors.
===============================================================================

If you want to increment the day based on a variable when using a loop you can
use this when you submit a form

1. Establish a start date and end date in two different variables

2. Get the number of days between a date

$ndays = (strtotime($_POST['edate']) - strtotime($_POST['sdate'])) / (60 * 60 *
24);

Then here is the string you slip in your loop

$nextday  = date('Y-m-d', mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m", strtotime($_POST['sdate']))
  , date("d", strtotime($_POST['sdate']))+ $count, date("Y", strtotime($_POST
['sdate']))));

$count is incremented by the loop.
===============================================================================

There are several warnings here about using mktime() to determine a date
difference because of daylight savings time. However, nobody seems to have
mentioned the other obvious problem, which is leap years.

Leap years mean that any effort to use mktime() and time() to determine the age
(positive or negative) of some timestamp in years will be flawed. There are
some years that are 366 days long, therefore you cannot say that there is a set
number of seconds per year.

Timestamps are good for determining *real* time, which is not the same thing as
*human calendar* time. The Gregorian calendar is only an approximation of real
time, which is tweaked with daylight savings time and leap years to make it
conform more to humans' expectations of how time should or ought to work.
Timestamps are not tweaked and therefore are the only authoritative way of
recording in computers a proper order of succession of events, but they cannot
be integrated with a Gregorian system unless you take both leap years and DST
into account. Otherwise, you may get the wrong number of years when you are
approaching a value of exactly X years.

As for PHP, you could still use timestamps as a way of determining age if you
took into account not only DST but also whether or not each year is a leap year
and adjusted your calculations accordingly. However, this could become messy
and inefficient.

There is an alternative approach to calculating days given the day, month and
year of the dates to be compared. Compare the years first, and then compare the
month and day - if the month and day have already passed (or, if you like, if
they match the current month and day), then add 1 to the total for the years.

This solution works because it stays within the Gregorian system and doesn't
venture into the world of timestamps.

There is also the issue of leap seconds, but this will only arise if you
literally need to get the *exact* age in seconds. In that case, of course, you
would also need to verify that your timestamps are exactly correct and are not
delayed by script processing time, plus you would need to determine whether
your system conforms to UTC, etc. I expect this will hardly be an issue for
anybody using PHP, however if you are interested there is an article on this
issue on Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second
===============================================================================

caculate days between two date

<?php
  // end date is 2008 Oct. 11 00:00:00
  $_endDate = mktime(0,0,0,11,10,2008);
  // begin date is 2007 May 31 13:26:26
  $_beginDate = mktime(13,26,26,05,31,2007);

  $timestamp_diff= $_endDate-$_beginDate +1 ;
  // how many days between those two date
  $days_diff = $timestamp_diff/86400;

?>
===============================================================================

Proper way to convert Excel dates into PHP-friendly timestamps using mktime():

<?php
// The date 6/30/2009 is stored as 39994 in Excel
$days = 39994;

// But you must subtract 1 to get the correct timestamp
$ts = mktime(0,0,0,1,$days-1,1900);

// So, this would then match Excel's representation:
echo date("m/d/Y",$ts);
?>

Excel uses "number of days since Jan. 1, 1900" to store its dates.  It also
treats 1900 as a leap year when it wasn't, thus there is an extra day which
must be accounted for in PHP (and the rest of the world).  Subtracting 1 from
Excel's number will fix this problem.
===============================================================================

Here is what I use to calculate age. It took me 30 minutes to write and it's
quite accurate. What it has special is that it's calculating the number of days
a year has (float number), by testing if a year is a leap one or not. This
number is used to compute the age.

<?php
function get_age($date_start, $date_end) {
    $t_lived = get_timestamp($date_end) - get_timestamp($date_start);
    $seconds_one_year = get_days_per_year($date_start, $date_end) * 24 * 60 * 
60;
    $age = array();
    $age['years_exact'] = $t_lived / $seconds_one_year;
    $age['years'] = floor($t_lived / $seconds_one_year);
    $seconds_remaining = $t_lived % $seconds_one_year;
    $age['days'] = round($seconds_remaining / (24 * 60 * 60));
    return $age;
}
function get_timestamp($date) {
    list($y, $m, $d) = explode('-', $date);
    return mktime(0, 0, 0, $m, $d, $y);
}
function get_days_per_year($date_start, $date_end) {
    list($y1) = explode('-', $date_start);
    list($y2) = explode('-', $date_end);
    $years_days = array();
    for($y = $y1; $y <= $y2; $y++) {
        $years_days[] = date('L', mktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, $y)) ? 366 : 365;
    }
    return round(array_sum($years_days) / count($years_days), 2);
}

$date_birth = '1979-10-12';
$date_now = date('Y-m-d');

$age = get_age($date_birth, $date_now);
echo '<pre>';
print_r($age);
echo '</pre>';
?>


It will display something like this:
Array
(
    [years_exact] => 28.972974329491
    [years] => 28
    [days] => 355
)
===============================================================================

to ADD or SUBSTRACT times NOTE that if you dont specify the UTC zone your
result is the difference +- your server UTC delay.

if you are ina utc/GMT +1

<?php
$hours_diff = strtotime("20:00:00")-strtotime("19:00:00");
echo  date('h:i', $hours_diff)." Hours";
?>

it shows: 02:00 Hours

but if you use a default UTC time:

<?php
date_default_timezone_set('UTC');
$hours_diff = strtotime("20:00:00")-strtotime("19:00:00");
echo "<br>". date('h:i', $hours_diff);
?>

it shows: 01:00 Hours.
===============================================================================

Please note that incrementing a date using mktime in a loop is not proper. You
could do it, except that there is a far better method found in the DateTime PHP
class. Look at the documentation for DateTime::modify, DateTime::add (when
supported) and DateTime::sub (when supported).

Also, adding seconds to a time is, well it isn't as easy as it seems, "Hey I'll
just add 3600 seconds or 86400 seconds or x seconds!". The phrase once bitten,
twice shy is quite applicable with the usage of adding seconds. If you ever had
to 'fix' a time by calculating midnight to add the correct number of seconds,
then you are doing it wrong.

Luckily, knowing is not a requirement, because DateTime and friends exists,
removing the complexity for you.

So if given a choice of

mktime($seconds, $minutes, $hours+1);

and

$datetime->modify('+1 hour');

or

$datetime->add('P1H');

I'll go with the second choice, but probably not the third, unless I was using
DateInterval::createFromDateString, so that other developers knew my intent.

function days_in_month($year, $month) {
    return( date( "t", mktime( 0, 0, 0, $month, 1, $year) ) );
}
?>

Hope it helps a soul out there.

this function returns the number of days of a provided month and year, it
consider the actual rules for leap years

(if the year is multiple of 4 which is not a multiple of 100 unless multiple of
thousand then is a leap)
Regards, hope this function solves any issue :)

function daysinmonth($month,$year) {
$dim = 0;
switch ($month) {
    case 1:
    case 3:
    case 5:
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 10:
    case 12:
        $dim=31;
        break;
    case 4:
    case 6:
    case 9:
    case 11:
        $dim=30;
        break;
    case 2:
        if($year%4==0) {
            if($year%100==0) {
                if($year%1000==0) { $dim=29; } else { $dim=28; }
            } else {
                $dim=29;
            }
        } else {$dim=28;}
        break;
    }
    return($dim);
}

Just a simple function to return mktime from a db (mysql) datetime (Y-m-d
H:i:s):

function retMktimest($dbdate) {
  return mktime(substr($dbdate, 11, 2), substr($dbdate, 14, 2), substr($dbdate,
17, 2), substr($dbdate, 5, 2), substr($dbdate, 8, 2), substr($dbdate, 0, 4));
}

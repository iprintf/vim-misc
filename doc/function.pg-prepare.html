pg_prepare

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7)

pg_prepare — Submits a request to create a prepared statement with the given
parameters, and waits for completion.

说明

resource pg_prepare ([ resource $connection ], string $stmtname , string $query
)

pg_prepare() creates a prepared statement for later execution with pg_execute()
or pg_send_execute(). This feature allows commands that will be used repeatedly
to be parsed and planned just once, rather than each time they are executed. 
pg_prepare() is supported only against PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher connections; it
will fail when using earlier versions.

The function creates a prepared statement named stmtname from the query string,
which must contain a single SQL command. stmtname may be "" to create an
unnamed statement, in which case any pre-existing unnamed statement is
automatically replaced; otherwise it is an error if the statement name is
already defined in the current session. If any parameters are used, they are
referred to in the query as $1, $2, etc.

Prepared statements for use with pg_prepare() can also be created by executing
SQL PREPARE statements. (But pg_prepare() is more flexible since it does not
require parameter types to be pre-specified.) Also, although there is no PHP
function for deleting a prepared statement, the SQL DEALLOCATE statement can be
used for that purpose.

参数

connection

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When connection is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by pg_connect() or pg_pconnect().

stmtname

    The name to give the prepared statement. Must be unique per-connection. If
    "" is specified, then an unnamed statement is created, overwriting any
    previously defined unnamed statement.

query

    The parameterized SQL statement. Must contain only a single statement.
    (multiple statements separated by semi-colons are not allowed.) If any
    parameters are used, they are referred to as $1, $2, etc.

返回值

A query result resource on success 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.

范例

Example #1 Using pg_prepare()

<?php
// Connect to a database named "mary"
$dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");

// Prepare a query for execution
$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name = $1'
);

// Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
// the string "Joe's Widgets" in any way
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Joe's Widgets"));

// Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Clothes Clothes Clothes"));

?>

参见

  • pg_execute() - Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given
    parameters, and waits for the result.
  • pg_send_execute() - Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with
    given parameters, without waiting for the result(s).

===============================================================================

If you decide to deallocate (unprepare) a previously prepared sql command it
might be better to quote the sql name as in

  DEALLOCATE "theNameOfMySQL"

instead of (the more natural)

  DEALLOCATE theNameOfMySQL

PostgerSQL preserves the case of your identifiers if, and only if, you quote
them. The pg_prepare function preserves the case of the sql name you use.

A complete example would be

  $sql = 'SELECT * FROM user WHERE cod_user = $1';
  $sqlName = 'selectUserByCode';
  if (!pg_prepare ($sqlName, $sql)) {
    die("Can't prepare '$sql': " . pg_last_error());
  }
  $rs = pg_execute($sqlName, array(1));
  do whatever you want with $rs and finally
  $sql = sprintf(
    'DEALLOCATE "%s"',
    pg_escape_string($sqlName)
  );
  if(!pg_query($sql)) {
    die("Can't query '$sql': " . pg_last_error());
  }
===============================================================================

The given name cannot be the statement itself.
It has a maximum length and will truncate.

If two queries begin the same way, only the first one will be used.
===============================================================================

I had some problems with this function. When you use pg_prepare() with a
function like date_trunc('day', $1) you need to specify the data type.

The solution was use the Pear MDB2 but with some changes in code. The original
code try to use pg_prepare() too, with errors.
===============================================================================

Any error in the prepare is available from pg_last_error().
===============================================================================

SQL is often a complicated piece of code by itself, so you may wish put it
inside a "here doc."  This will help you read it wherever it appears and test
it by itself via a command-line or gui client.

$sql = <<<SQL
SELECT a.foo, b.bar, c.baz
FROM
    table_a a
LEFT JOIN
    table_b b
ON (
    a.a_id = b.a_id
)
JOIN
    table_c c
ON (
    b.c_id = c.c_id
)
WHERE c.name = $1
SQL;
===============================================================================

Note that if you are preparing a query with an in clause with a list of items,
you will need to prepare each item separately.

$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name IN
($1,$2,$3)');

$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("coffee", "beer", "hard"));

This means that you can't just prepare a query with an arbitrary in() list.

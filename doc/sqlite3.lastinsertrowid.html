===============================================================================

lastInsertRowID is relative to the database connection. Hence if there are two
instances of a php script (with distinct $db connections) there is no risk that
the RowID of the one instance will effect the result of the other instance.

I mention this point here as it was not clear from the documentation, at least
not very clear to me and hence I hope it might help others.

break

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

break 结束当前 for，foreach，while，do-while 或者 switch 结构的执行。

break 可以接受一个可选的数字参数来决定跳出几重循环。

<?php
$arr = array('one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'stop', 'five');
while (list (, $val) = each($arr)) {
    if ($val == 'stop') {
        break;    /* You could also write 'break 1;' here. */
    }
    echo "$val<br />\n";
}

/* 使用可选参数 */

$i = 0;
while (++$i) {
    switch ($i) {
    case 5:
        echo "At 5<br />\n";
        break 1;  /* 只退出 switch. */
    case 10:
        echo "At 10; quitting<br />\n";
        break 2;  /* 退出 switch 和 while 循环 */
    default:
        break;
    }
}
?>

                     break 的更新记录
版本                          说明
5.4.0 break 0; 不再合法。这在之前的版本被解析为 break 1;。
5.4.0 取消变量作为参数传递（例如 $num = 2; break $num;）。

A break statement that is in the outer part of a program (e.g. not in a control
loop) will end the script. This caught me out when I mistakenly had a break in
an if statement

i.e.

<?php
echo "hello";
if (true) break;
echo " world";
?>

will only show "hello"

It's not necessary to break out of any case of a switch  statement in PHP, but
if you want only one case to be executed, you have do break out of it (even out
of the default case).

Consider this:

<?php
$a = 'Apple';
switch ($a) {
    default:
        echo '$a is not an orange<br>';
    case 'Orange':
        echo '$a is an orange';
}
?>

This prints (in PHP 5.0.4 on MS-Windows):
$a is not an orange
$a is an orange

Note that the PHP documentation does not state the default part must be the
last case statement.

$to_square_root=65536;
$i=1;
$limit=4;
while (true) {
$square_root=sqrt($to_square_root);
echo "Square Root of $to_square_root is $square_root.<BR>";
$to_square_root=$square_root;
$i=$i+1;
if ($i>$limit) // if ($i<$limit) is used, loop breaks on very first execution
break;
}
$loop=$i-1;
echo "This loop is executes for $loop times.";
/* Above codes produces following output in browser

*/
?>
===============================================================================

If the numerical argument is higher than the number of things which can be
broken out of, it seems to me like the execution of the entire program is
stopped.
My program had 8 nested loops. Didn't bother counting them, but wrote: break
10. - Result: Code following the loops was not processed.
===============================================================================

Here is a function that returns specific files in an array, with all of the
details. Includes some basic garbage checking.

Variables

$source_folder // the location of your files
$ext // file extension you want to limit to (i.e.: *.txt)
$sec // if you only want files that are at least so old.
$limit // number of files you want to return

The function

function glob_files($source_folder, $ext, $sec, $limit){
    if( !is_dir( $source_folder ) ) {
        die ( "Invalid directory.\n\n" );
    }
   
    $FILES = glob($source_folder."\*.".$ext);
    $set_limit    = 0;
   
    foreach($FILES as $key => $file) {
   
        if( $set_limit == $limit )    break;
       
        if( filemtime( $file ) > $sec ){
       
            $FILE_LIST[$key]['path']    = substr( $file, 0, ( strrpos( $file, "
\\" ) +1 ) );
            $FILE_LIST[$key]['name']    = substr( $file, ( strrpos( $file, "\\"
) +1 ) );   
            $FILE_LIST[$key]['size']    = filesize( $file );
            $FILE_LIST[$key]['date']    = date('Y-m-d G:i:s', filemtime( $file
) );
            $set_limit++;
       
        }
       
    }
    if(!empty($FILE_LIST)){
        return $FILE_LIST;
    } else {
        die( "No files found!\n\n" );
    }
}

So....

$source_folder = "c:\temp\my_videos";
$ext = "flv"; // flash video files
$sec = "7200"; // files older than 2 hours
$limit = 2; // Only get 2 files

print_r(glob_files($source_folder, $ext, $sec, $limit));

Would return:

Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [path] => c:\temp\my_videos\
            [name] => fluffy_bunnies.flv
            [size] => 21160480
            [date] => 2007-10-30 16:48:05
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [path] => c:\temp\my_videos\
            [name] => synergymx.com.flv
            [size] => 14522744
            [date] => 2007-10-25 15:34:45
        )
===============================================================================

<?php
echo 'Hello ';
foreach (array('1','2','3','4','5') as $id) {
  echo $id . ' ';
  if ($id == 3)
    break;
  }
}
echo ' world.';
?>

Prints:

Hello 1 2 3 world.
===============================================================================

if you, like me, are used to C, 'break' in php is likely to catch you out as
well, especially after an 'if'.
===============================================================================

Just to note: break doesn't work within included file, results in fatal error.

main.php:
<?php
switch ( $i )
{
  case '1': // Works
    echo "$i";
    break;
  case '2': // Works
    require( 'include1.inc' );
    break;
  case '3': // Doesn't work
    require( 'include2.inc' );
    break;
  case '4': // Doesn't work, same reason
    require( 'include2.inc' );
  default: // Works
    echo "$i";
}
?>

include1.inc:
<?php
  echo "$i";
?>

include2.inc:
<?php
  echo "$i";
  break;
?>

I didn't find this documented anywhere.
===============================================================================

If you wonder how to end execution of a function (as I did), it's that simple:
return

function foo($a) {
if(!$a) return;
echo 'true';
// some other code
}

foo(true) will echo 'true', foo(false) won't echo anything (as return ends
execution of the function. Of course, therefore there is no need for 'else'
before 'echo').
===============================================================================

Note that the break argument accepts any expression, including a function
result. So you may want to dynamically choose the loop level to break from:

<?php

// the print() function returns 1

function icarus()
{
    while(print('sea level, '))
        while(print('through the clouds, '))
            while(print('close the Sun - '))
                break rand(print('FEATHERS LOSS! - '), 3);
   
    print('no feathers remaining.');
}

icarus();

?>
===============================================================================

"Just an insignificant side not: Like in C/C++, it's not necessary to break out
of the default part of a switch statement in PHP."

--Yes it is, it's just that traditionally default: is the last entry of a
switch and so nothing happens after.

-If it was, for whatever reason, not the last entry the script would bawk,
there is no implicit break; associated with switch.
===============================================================================

The previous note has a somewhat stupid author: why didn't you put an example?

If I got it right, "case"s in "switch"es always need a "break".
So this switch ...

<?php
switch ( $i ) {
  case '1': // Works
    echo "$i=1";
    break;
  case '2': // Works
    require( 'include1.inc' );
    break;
  case '3': // Doesn't work
    require( 'include2.inc' );
    break;
  case '4': // Doesn't work, same reason
    require( 'include2.inc' );
  default: // Works
    echo "$i";
}
?>

... has a problem in case "4" in that it doesn't have a "break" and this
file...

include2.inc:
<?php
  echo "$i";
  break;
?>

... has a problem in that it has a "break" that is not in a "control structure"
(like while, for...).

In the same way, although "include2.inc" is "include"d (obvioulsy) in the <?php
?> script (of main.php), it still need another <?php ?> to wrap its content.

Likewise,

main.php
<?php
echo "<div>This div is generated by php</div>\n";
include 'file.php'; ?>
echo "<div>This div is also generated by php</div>\n";

file.php:
<div>This is an old static HTML div.</div>

... doesn't require "file.php" content to start with "?>" (exit php) and end
with "<?php" (go back to line 3 of main.php). This would FAIL.

(See strange structure ALWAYS fail"?>!)

Does this really need documentation?
===============================================================================

To make it very clear, if you use "break" with no numerical argument, that's
the same as doing "break 1".

"break 0", while allowed, does nothing.
===============================================================================

It should be noted prior to PHP 7 you could use break in much the way you could
use return. However as of PHP 7 this will produce a fatal error.

function a() {
if (1 === 1) {
break;
}
echo 'something';
}

The above will break in php 7 but will not produce any error in previous
versions.
===============================================================================

Your break doesn't work because it isn't within a control structure.  I use
includes that have breaks and they work fine because they are in a control
structure (foreach, while, etc.)
===============================================================================

For Perl or C programmers...

break is equivelant to last

while(false ! == ($site = $d->read()) ) {
  if ($site === 'this') {
     break;  // in perl this could be last;
  }
}
===============================================================================

To add to the responses given to "vlad at vlad dot neosurge dot net" - I'd like
to note the lack of automatic breaking in 'default' can be a very good thing.
Consider this useful snippet:

<?php

switch((string) $_REQUEST['mode']) {
  default:
     $_REQUEST['mode'] = "search";
     // fall through...
  case 'search' :
  case 'list' :
  case 'add' :
  case 'edit' :
     require(dirname(__FILE__)."/incs/".$_REQUEST['mode'].".php");
     break;
}

?>

I personally find that far easier to look at than, for example:

<?php

$valid_modes = array('search','list','add','edit');
if (in_array($_REQUEST['mode'],$valid_modes)) {
     require(dirname(__FILE__)."/incs/".$_REQUEST['mode'].".php");
} else {
     require(dirname(__FILE__)."/incs/search.php");
}

?>

...and it even has the added benefit that the switch() variant only has one
require() statement, which makes for easier maintenance, e.g. if the directory
changes, or what-have-you.

(Consider the above pseudocode, please, it's not tested - it's code
illustrating a point only.)

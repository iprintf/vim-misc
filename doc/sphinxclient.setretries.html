SphinxClient::setRetries — Set retry count and delay

说明

public bool SphinxClient::setRetries ( int $count [, int $delay = 0 ] )

Sets distributed retry count and delay.

On temporary failures searchd will attempt up to count retries per agent. delay
is the delay between the retries, in milliseconds. Retries are disabled by
default. Note that this call will not make the API itself retry on temporary
failure; it only tells searchd to do so.

参数

count

    Number of retries.

delay

    Delay between retries, in milliseconds.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

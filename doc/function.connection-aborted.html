A trick to detecting if a connection is closed without having to send data that
will otherwise corrupt the stream of data (like a binary file) you can use a
combination of chunking the data on HTTP/1.1 by sending a "0" ("zero") as a
leading chunk size without anything else.

*NOTE* it's important to note that it's not a good idea to check the stream
more then once every few seconds. By doing this you are potentially increasing
the data sent to the user with no gain to the user.

A good reason to do it this way is if you are generating a report that takes a
long time to run and takes a lot of server resources. This would allow the
server to detect if a user canceled the download and do any cleanup without
corrupting the file file being download.

Here is an example:

<?php
ignore_user_abort(true);
header('Transfer-Encoding:chunked');
ob_flush();
flush();
$start = microtime(true);
$i = 0;
// Use this function to echo anything to the browser.
function vPrint($data){
    if(strlen($data))
        echo dechex(strlen($data)), "\r\n", $data, "\r\n";
    ob_flush();
    flush();
}
// You MUST execute this function after you are done streaming information to
the browser.
function endPacket(){
    echo "0\r\n\r\n";
    ob_flush();
    flush();
}
do{
    echo "0";
    ob_flush();
    flush();
    if(connection_aborted()){
        // This happens when connection is closed
        file_put_contents('/tmp/test.tmp', sprintf("Conn Closed\nTime spent
with connection open: %01.5f sec\nLoop itterations: %s\n\n", microtime(true) - 
$start, $i), FILE_APPEND);
        endPacket();
        exit;
    }
    usleep(50000);
    vPrint("I get echo'ed every itteration (every .5 second)<br />\n");
}while($i++ < 200);
endPacket();
?>

I have failed to get accurate results from this even with echo, flush(), and
other buffer manipulation trickery. The following function detects connection
status from the OS netstat(1) in linux, even without echoing anything. You may
need to alter the parsing for windows or older versions of netstat. It calls an
external command so it consume some resources, use it with care e.g. you can
call it every some seconds while waiting for long-poll requests. Not tested
with ipv6.

//returns connection status (ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT, etc) or NOT_FOUND
function getConnectionStatus() {
            $remote_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']?:($_SERVER
['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']?:$_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP']);
            $remote_port=$_SERVER['REMOTE_PORT'];

            $cmd="netstat -tn | fgrep ' $remote_ip:$remote_port '";

            $pfp=popen($cmd,"r");
                        if(!$pfp) {
                                error_log ("getConnectionStatus: $cmd");
                        }

            $buf = fgets($pfp, 1024);
            pclose($pfp);

            $buf=preg_replace('!\s+!', ' ', $buf); //remove multiple spaces
            $buf=trim($buf);

            $buf_r=explode(" ",$buf);

            if (count($buf_r)) {
                    $state=$buf_r[count($buf_r)-1];
                    return trim($state);
            }

            return "NOTFOUND";
    }

//check for it:
if (getConnectionStatus() != "ESTABLISHED") { ...}
===============================================================================

From ignore_user_abort function :

PHP will not detect that the user has aborted the connection until an attempt
is made to send information to the client. Simply using an echo statement does
not guarantee that information is sent, see flush().

This rule seems to apply here too.
===============================================================================

In order to detect a disconnection inside the script we need to flush the
buffer (it is only when the the server tries to send the buffer content that it
will see that the connection is broken).

Thus we need to use the ob_implicit_flush() function to flush automatically the
buffer

This is an example of a disconnection detection :

<?php
  // enables the automatic flush
  ob_implicit_flush();

  function verifyCommunication() {
    $status = (connection_aborted()?"not ":"") ."sent";
    persistCommunication(new Communication($status));
  }

  // we will check the communication state when the script finished
  register_shutdown_function(verifyCommunication);
  echo "blabla";
  // this sleep is used to have time to break the connection on the client side
  sleep(10);
  echo"tata";
?>

I use such a process to cancel a request if the client didn't get the
acknowledgement because he will redo his request...
===============================================================================

Although the documentation indicates it returns an int, I found comparing the
return value with numeric values does not seem to work.

Example (does not work):
<?php
if (connection_aborted()==1) {
fwrite($filehandle, 'aborted!');
}
?>

You're better off just assuming it returns boolean

Example (does work):
<?php
if (connection_aborted()) {
fwrite($filehandle, 'aborted!');
}
?>

(connection_aborted not working)
I had this problem years ago, now the problem came back after upgrading php...
i tried everything i found and in the end the function ob_end_flush();  on top
of script as post in php bug track solved the problem. Im using windows 7 x64 /
php 5.2.4 / apache 2.2.14 (win32)

try adding ob_end_flush(); on top of you script.
i read something about this but can't remember where, it was related to a bug
or something.

hope this help.

vprintf

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

vprintf — 输出格式化字符串

说明

int vprintf ( string $format , array $args )

根据 format （sprintf() 函数文档中有相关描述）参数指定的格式，在一个格式化字符
串中显示多个值。

作用与 printf() 函数类似，但是接收一个数组参数，而不是一系列可变数量的参数。

参数

format

    关于 format 的描述，参见 sprintf()。

args

返回值

返回输出字符串的长度。

范例

Example #1 vprintf(): 前导 0 的整数

<?php
vprintf("%04d-%02d-%02d", explode('-', '1988-8-1')); // 1988-08-01
?>

===============================================================================

If, instead of an array, you pass an object PHP will automatically cast the
object as an array so you can use it directly in vprintf.
<?php
$object = new stdClass();
$object->Property1 = 'Value 1';
$object->Property2 = 'Value 2';
vprintf('%-20s %-20s', $object);

/* will output
Value 1              Value 2            
*/
?>
===============================================================================

Another way to display arrays is use an array_walk(). This can be useful inline
echo/print where a foreach wouldn't work, e.g.

<?php
echo "These errors: ", (unset)array_walk($msgs, function($a) { echo "<p>$a</p>"
; } ), "must be corrected.";
?>

For blocks of text, sprintf() is slow according to my tests.

Also, having the mapping between place-holders and the list of actual variables
or datastructures often makes this code difficult to read. But the printf()
family are widely supported and have a huge range of nice features. Performance
is a cold mistress though!

From an ease-of-reading and maintenance, debugging point of view, I much prefer
HEREDOC and "...{$variable}..." methods.

For a block of HTML markup with place holders, the fastest by far was:-

?>
<div> markup etc<?= $variable ?>more markup
<?

My tests comprised 20 runs of a loop of 1 million iterations with output
buffering, ditching the buffer on each loop.

The timings ranged from average 2.1msec/million repetitions for the <?= $var ?>
method up to 7.6msec/million using printf().

I'll try some benchmarking tools too, since I just wrote this myself and it
could be introducing bias, but they've run on dev servers with low load.

Hopefully interesting.

To toolofthesystem at gmail dot com:

You don't need to use output buffering with vprintf() because you can use
vsprintf(), which has the same functionality as vprintf(), except that it
returns the resulting string instead of outputting it.
===============================================================================

This function comes useful sometimes when trying to list information returned
from MySQL:

function print_sql($query,$printf){
    $sql_sql = mysql_query($query);
    while($sql = mysql_fetch_row($sql_sql)){
        vprintf($printf,$sql);
    }
}

Unfortunately, this seems to sneak its way past output buffering when I tried
creating an argument to allow it to be contained in a returned string... either
that or I didn't do it right.
===============================================================================

i know that you can use %1$s or %3$s to select the first or third string but
how can you or can you use array names to select it

something like %'user'$s $'email'$s

i tend to add things to my databases over time and this could save loads of
recoding
===============================================================================

<?php
$string = 'The site runs on PHP '.phpversion();
preg_match('/php ((\d)\.\d\.\d+)/i',$string,$matches);
print_r($matches);
vprintf('Match: %s<br /> Version %s; Major:%d.',$matches);
?>

output:
Array ( [0] => PHP 5.2.5 [1] => 5.2.5 [2] => 5 )
Match: PHP 5.2.5 Version 5.2.5; Major:5.

For preg_match:

If matches  is provided, then it is filled with the results of search. $matches
[0] will contain the text that matched the full pattern, $matches[1]  will have
the text that matched the first captured parenthesized subpattern, and so on.

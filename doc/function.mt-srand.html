mt_srand

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mt_srand — 播下一个更好的随机数发生器种子

说明

void mt_srand ([ int $seed ] )

用 seed 来给随机数发生器播种。没有设定 seed 参数时，会被设为随时数。

    Note: 自 PHP 4.2.0 起，不再需要用 srand() 或 mt_srand() 给随机数发生器播种
    ，因为现在是由系统自动完成的。

参数

seed

    可选的种子值

返回值

没有返回值。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
4.2.0 The seed becomes optional and defaults to a random value if omitted.
      The Mersenne Twister implementation in PHP now uses a new seeding
      algorithm by Richard Wagner. Identical seeds no longer produce the same
5.2.1 sequence of values they did in previous versions. This behavior is not
      expected to change again, but it is considered unsafe to rely upon it
      nonetheless.

Looks like mt_rand() gives same result for different seeds when the lowest bits
are different only. Try this:

#!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php

$min = -17;
$max = $min + 48; // 48 is to fit the results in my console

for ($testseed=$min; $testseed<$max; $testseed++)
{
    mt_srand( $testseed );
    $r = mt_rand();
    printf("mt_srand( 0x%08x ): mt_rand() == 0x%08x == %d\n", $testseed, $r, $r
);
}

?>

This is a snapshop of the results:
...
mt_srand( 0xfffffffc ): mt_rand() == 0x0a223d97 == 170016151
mt_srand( 0xfffffffd ): mt_rand() == 0x0a223d97 == 170016151
mt_srand( 0xfffffffe ): mt_rand() == 0x350a9509 == 889885961
mt_srand( 0xffffffff ): mt_rand() == 0x350a9509 == 889885961
mt_srand( 0x00000000 ): mt_rand() == 0x71228443 == 1898087491
mt_srand( 0x00000001 ): mt_rand() == 0x71228443 == 1898087491
mt_srand( 0x00000002 ): mt_rand() == 0x4e0a2cdd == 1309289693
mt_srand( 0x00000003 ): mt_rand() == 0x4e0a2cdd == 1309289693
...

I found this occationally. I have no idea if it is a bug or not. In my real
life I do not intend to use sequentional seeds. However, probably this may be
important for somebody.
===============================================================================

"Better still: Use a 31-bit hash of microtime() as the seed. "

Correct me if i am wrong, but woudlnt using microtime() still limit the total
seeds to 1,000,000 again? Since the 31-bit hash will always give the same hash
for the same number, and in the microtime() function you could have 1,000,000
or less numbers. So in effect your still no better off at all :-p

Best regards,
scott

PS: I actually agree that PHP has pretty much resolved the issue and got as
close as anyones going to get to solving the seeding issue by introducing the
"Mersenne Twister" algorithm which creates a much larger pool than 1,000,000
numbers. Just because the mt_srand() function exists doesnt mean you HAVE to
use it ;-) use it if you NEED a specific list of the same numbers (comes in
handy for encryptions with passwords ;-)
===============================================================================

used the little script from mrcheezy at hotmail dot com and got much better
results using

mt_srand(crc32(microtime()));
===============================================================================

If you are new with seeding read my note.

I now understood seeding as a start-state of an algorithm. This algorithm
generates a series of -following- pseudorandom numbers.
If you start generating from the same startvalue twice, you get the same series
of random numbers twice in a row.

mt_srand(10); //start of your algorithm equals seeding set to 10
for($i=0;$i<10;$i++){
    echo mt_rand();
}

echo "<BR>";

mt_srand(10); //start of your algorithm equals seeding set back to 10
for($i=0;$i<10;$i++){
    echo mt_rand();
}

Output is like:
502355954641584702211262118810740890731360749216120791137454651988317865160461082451610903986200
<BR>

My conclusion: Don't preset your seed to the same number all the time if you
want "alternating random numbers"

Greetings
===============================================================================

@  fasaxc at yahoo dot com:

If you want truly random numbers, use a truly random source. Your system is
rather unwieldy when you can simply call openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() for good
randomness. Don't use microtime as a source of randomness.
===============================================================================

I think Joe was a little confused by the wording.  The note meant that
implementations of mt_rand() before the change would generate a different set
of pseudorandom numbers than would implementations of mt_rand() after the
change for the same seed.

That's how it reads for me, anyway.
===============================================================================

mt_srand effectively performs a modulo % 2147483648 on positive integers over
32 bits, but with negative integers it instead adds 2147483648 to the value it
gets.

Seeds with equal results:
2147483649 == 1
2147483648 == 0
2147483647 == -1
-2147483646 == 2
-2147483647 == 1
-2147483648 == 0

Importantly though, seeding with anything less than -2147483648 will always
yield the same result as seeding with zero.
===============================================================================

What about this for an example...

(sorry for the funky line breaks but I have once
more reported the bug on this issue of word
wrapping to no avail)

Intending to use it in passing a "semi-guaranteed"
properly seeded random number to a client, then to
capture input from the user which must be encrypted
client side before being sent to the server again
  a) during the same session and,
  b) within a set time limit.

To slonmron:
Seed for random numbers generator should be initialized only once, before
calling proper rand function. After that you give pseudorandom sequence by
multiple calling rand. Initialization of random seed is used if 1) You have
better source of random seed than implemented algorithm or 2) if You need
always the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers. Example given by You shows
only that first rand result strongly depends on seed, what is by definition. It
is not a bug.
===============================================================================

Very good points above on seeds, thank you. If you would like to test a seed
try using the code below. It will take between 5 and 20 seconds depending on
your system and then will spit out the number of reused keys out of 100,000
attempts.

;  for ($i=0; $i<100000; $i++) {
;    mt_srand(hexdec(substr(md5(microtime()), -8)) & 0x7fffffff);
;    $rand = mt_rand();
;
;    ($arr[$rand] == '1') ? $k++ : $arr[$rand] = '1';
;  }
===============================================================================

to : l_rossato@libero.it

doing ...

list($usec,$sec)=explode(" ",microtime());
$unique = mt_srand($sec * $usec);

theoretiaclly, makes just as much sense as

list($usec,$sec)=explode(" ",microtime());
$unique = $usec + 0;

Once every while, depending on the microsecond resolution of your computer, the
millisecond value will be a zero (0), and as I hope you know, in mathematics,
any number multiplied by a zero becomes a zero itself.

(x * 0 = 0)

In real life, on a good machine, with a resolution to 1 million miliseconds per
each second (i.e: Win2k server), you will be reduplicating your unique ID each
million's ID issued. This means if you use it as your cookie encryption
algorithm or a visitor ID, you will not exceed some million instances.

Futhermore, if that would be for a software development that you
re-distribuite, installed on some weird old PC, where resolution can be as
small as 100 milliseconds per second - a code with this uniqueness algorithm
just wouldn't last any long.

Good Luck,

Sorry for the error in the previous...
Due to the glitch with the wordwrap I got annoyed and lost focus on the copy
and paste move.

The last part of the actual function should read.

<?php
// select what we need to return
    if ((($retMax == 0)&&($retMax = mt_getrandmax))||
($retMin==$retMax)){
        return mt_rand();
    }else{
        return mt_rand($retMin,$retMax);
    }

?>

And Nothing else of course...
===============================================================================

try this instead(!):

<?php

// randomizes MT's seed once per process.

function randomizeProcessSeed()
{
    static $thisProcessHasBeenInitialized;

    if( $thisProcessHasBeenInitialized ) return;

    list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
    mt_srand( (10000000000 * (float)$usec) ^ (float)$sec );
   
    $thisProcessHasBeenInitialized = true;
} randomizeProcessSeed();
?>

In fact, here's an even better function than the one below assuming your
install provides a random entropy daemon and you're running *nix (to check for
the former type "head -c 6 /dev/urandom" on the command line if available - if
you get 6 random characters you're set). N.B. php must be able to find the head
program so it must be in your path and allowed if you're running safe mode.

The functions db_set_global() and db_get_global() I use to set/get a variable
from a central database but you could save/restore the variable from a file
instead or just use the function get_random_word().

<?

####################################
## returns a random 32bit integer.
## Passing a parameter of True gives a better random

####################################
function get_random_word($force_random=False) {
    if ($force_random) {
        $u='';
    } else {
        $u='u';
    }
    $ran_string=shell_exec("head -c 4 /dev/{$u}random");
    $random=ord(substr($ran_string,0,1))<<24 |
            ord(substr($ran_string,1,1))<<16 |
            ord(substr($ran_string,2,1))<<8 |
            ord(substr($ran_string,3,1));
    return $random;
}

--EITHER - IF YOU'VE SET UP A DATABASE OF GLOBAL VARIABLES--

## If the seed is found in the database
if ($seed=db_get_global('seed')) {
    # use mt_rand() to get the next seed
    mt_srand($seed);
    # then XOR that with a random word
    $seed=(mt_rand() ^ get_random_word());
} else {
## Make a completely new seed (First Run)
    # Generate the seed as a proper random no using /dev/random
    $seed=get_random_word(True);
    mt_srand($seed);
}

db_set_global('seed',$seed);

--OR JUST--
mt_srand(get_random_word());

?>
===============================================================================

The best way to ensure a random seed is to do the following:
To start:
   1) get your initial seed with mt_srand(microtime() * 1000000)
   2) generate a random no. $random=mt_rand()
   3) save this number in a file (or database or whatever so that it is
available next time the page is loaded)

Now, for each time your script is loaded :
   1) load the value you saved above and do $new_seed=($random+(microtime() *
1000000))%pow(2,32)
   2) mt_srand($new_seed);
   3) generate a new random no. $random=mt_rand()
   4) save that number back in the file/database

This procedure takes advantage not only of the randomness of microtime() but of
all the previous calls to microtime() so your seed becomes better and better
with time. It also generates good seeds even on platforms where microtime()
doesn't take all the values it can.

Just using microtime() * 1000000 only results in 1000000 possible seeds (and
less on some platforms as noted) - the function above gives 2^32 seeds with an
avelanche effect accross multiple executions.
===============================================================================

I have spent the last couple of hours trying to track down a bug which affects
mt_rand/rand and mt_srand/mt_rand.

OS is Debian 5.0.4 "Lenny".
PHP version is 5.3.2-0.dotdeb.1 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Mar  9 2010
11:42:01).

I have tried to fix the issue by appending the following lines into the
.htaccess / apache2 main config file:

        php_value suhosin.mt_srand.ignore Off
        php_value suhosin.srand.ignore Off

This has helped a bit, stabilizing the beggining of the pseudo random number
sequence, but the generator still fails after a fair number of iterations
(roughly around 1K~3K.

*** Removing the Suhosin extension has resolved this issue, I am waiting for an
official extension build that will work with 5.3.x so that I can reattach it
into the php configuration. ***

Here is the code which ought to replicate the problem:

    $len = 100000;
    $min = 0;
    $max = 99;

    $t = (int)(microtime(true)*0xFFFF);

    $a = array();
    srand( $t );

    for ( $i = 0; $i < $len; $i ++ )
        $a[$i] = rand( $min, $max );

    $b = array();
    srand( $t );

    for ( $i = 0; $i < $len; $i ++ )
        $b[$i] = rand( $min, $max );

    for ( $i = 0; $i < $len; $i ++ )
        if ( $a[$i] !== $b[$i] )
            die( 'Pseudo-random sequence borked at #'.$i.'th iteration!');

    echo 'Your pseudo-random sequencer is working correctly.';
    exit( 0 );
===============================================================================

It's better to use the following method instead of the one in the documentation
metioned:

<?php
mt_srand((double)(microtime() ^ posix_getpid()));
?>

Otherwise people requesting the script at the same time could get the same
generated number.
===============================================================================

The range of unique seeds using this method is a bit over 2 billion.  This
approach also prevents re-seeding.

function seed_mt_rand() {
  static $done;
  if (!$done) {
    $hash = md5(microtime());
    $length = ((substr($hash,0,1) < '8') ? 8 : 7 );
    mt_srand((int)base_convert(substr($hash,0,$length),16,10));
    $done = TRUE;
  }
}
===============================================================================

list($usec,$sec) = explode(" ",microtime());

/* Test: Each get rand sequence are 10time. */
/* ex) 5.3point meaning 5point integer + 3point decimal */

// case A:
// 5.0point - 1time
// 6.0point - 9time
$rand = (double)microtime()*1000000;

// case B:
// 8.6point - 1time
// 9.4point - 1time
// 9.5point - 7time
// 10.3point - 1time
$rand = (double)$sec * $usec;

// My case A:
// 8.0point - 10time
$rand = explode(".",$usec * $sec);
$rand = (double)substr($rand[0]*$rand[1],0,8);

// My case B:
// 9.0point - 9time
// 10.0point - 1time
$rand = explode(".",$usec * $sec);
$rand = $rand[0] + $rand[1];

mt_srand($rand);
srand($rand);

// P.S> My previous note is has wrong lines, sorry about it.  This is right.

Something we discovered in Sydney running BBS Systems before the net advent was
here, if we didn't seed of another BBS we would going in circles in our System
Physicality Abstraction Layers.. The important thing is to seed from a remote
system and easy way at the Centroidal Plexus of the web (Chronolabs
Cooperative) we offer a seed feed and the following code will randomise you out
of the number cycle:

See in PHP both the letters and numbers are seedable as letters are treated as
numbers as well. You can always use individual tokens by extracting the Element
with DOM.. But below is equally effective!

<?php

mt_srand(file_get_contents('http://seed.feeds.labs.coop'));

?>
===============================================================================

I can’t stress how important it is to seed your randomisation process in code!
better still something we found in the BBS Days was if we didn’t seed from a
token from outside our systems abstraction layer we would go in circles and so
would our users. Here at chronolabs we offer a feed of randomly changing token
on each impression, it also randomly displays a different number of them this
is from http://seed.feeds.labs.coop in the example below I use DOM to load the
XML, Extract the randomisation tokens and then with mt_srand and srand seed the
random selecting processes! The following function when you call it will seed
your random selection process in both the old and new random selection routines
all you need to do is call the function! This will work with any version of PHP
5 and any earlier with DOM Objectivity.

function makeRandomSeeded() {
    $file = 'http://seed.feeds.labs.coop/';
    $doc = new DOMDocument();
    $doc->loadHTMLFile($file);
    $skip = array('This feed can', 'Current mode is');
    $elements = $doc->getElementsByTagName('description');
    foreach($elements as $element) {
        $seed = $element->nodeValue;
        $found = false;
        foreach($skip as $find) {
            if (substr($seed, 0, strlen($find))==$find) {
                $found = true;
            }
        }
        if ($found==false)
            $seeds[] = $seed;
    }
    shuffle($seeds);
    mt_srand($seeds[mt_rand(0, count($seeds)-1)]);
    srand($seeds[mt_rand(0, count($seeds)-1)]);
}

Remember when PHP says an integer this also include any character of the Ascii
chart if you would like to see an example of this do the following:

<?php
   $a = "000A";
   while($a!="001B") {
      echo $a;
      $a++;
   }
?>

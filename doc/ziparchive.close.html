===============================================================================

If you're adding multiple files to a zip and your $zip->close() call is
returning FALSE, ensure that all the files you added actually exist. Apparently
$zip->addFile() returns TRUE even if the file doesn't actually exist. It's a
good idea to check each file with file_exists() or is_readable() before calling
$zip->addFile() on it.
===============================================================================

If you have created a zip file and added a file to it without error, yet the
ZipArchive::close call fails (with ER_TMPOPEN: "Failure to create temporary
file") and the zip file is not created, check to see if your ZipArchive::open
call specifies a pathname containing nonexisting directories. If you expect a
containing hierarchy of one or more directories, you must create them yourself
before using using ZipArchive. You can write a simple function to recurse using
dirname to find each parent directory, creating those that don't exist by using
mkdir when leaving the recursion.
===============================================================================

It may seem a little obvious to some but it was an oversight on my behalf.

If you are adding files to the zip file that you want to be deleted make sure
you delete AFTER you call the close() function.

If the files added to the object aren't available at save time the zip file
will not be created.
===============================================================================

Don't forget to check the zip isn't empty, folks - otherwise the zip won't be
created at all, and the server will issue no warning!

I used a certain loop to add files to the zip, and struggled with permissions
and documentation for hours before I realize the loop ended up adding no file,
even though addFile WAS called, but on a non-existent file.
This might be the reason your zips aren't popping up.
===============================================================================

Please note you must have write permissions to file and directory where the
files is placed to save the archive.
===============================================================================

Pay attention, that ZipArchive::addFile() only opens file descriptor and does
not compress it. And only ZipArchive::close() compress file and it take quite a
lot of time. Be careful with timeouts.

fopen

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fopen — 打开文件或者 URL

说明

resource fopen ( string $filename , string $mode [, bool $use_include_path =
false [, resource $context ]] )

fopen() 将 filename 指定的名字资源绑定到一个流上。

参数

filename

    如果 filename 是 "scheme://..." 的格式，则被当成一个 URL，PHP 将搜索协议处
    理器（也被称为封装协议）来处理此模式。如果该协议尚未注册封装协议，PHP 将发
    出一条消息来帮助检查脚本中潜在的问题并将 filename 当成一个普通的文件名继续
    执行下去。

    如果 PHP 认为 filename 指定的是一个本地文件，将尝试在该文件上打开一个流。该
    文件必须是 PHP 可以访问的，因此需要确认文件访问权限允许该访问。如果激活了安
    全模式或者 open_basedir 则会应用进一步的限制。

    如果 PHP 认为 filename 指定的是一个已注册的协议，而该协议被注册为一个网络
    URL，PHP 将检查并确认 allow_url_fopen 已被激活。如果关闭了，PHP 将发出一个
    警告，而 fopen 的调用则失败。

        Note:

        所支持的协议列表见支持的协议和封装协议。某些协议（也被称为 wrappers）支
        持 context 和／或 php.ini 选项。参见相应的页面哪些选项可以被设定（例如
        php.ini 中用于 http wrapper 的 user_agent 值）。

    On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes used in the
    path to the file, or use forward slashes.
    <?php
    $handle = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r");
    ?>

mode

    mode 参数指定了所要求到该流的访问类型。可以是以下：

                         fopen() 中 mode 的可能值列表
    mode                                  说明
    'r'  只读方式打开，将文件指针指向文件头。
    'r+' 读写方式打开，将文件指针指向文件头。
    'w'  写入方式打开，将文件指针指向文件头并将文件大小截为零。如果文件不存在则
         尝试创建之。
    'w+' 读写方式打开，将文件指针指向文件头并将文件大小截为零。如果文件不存在则
         尝试创建之。
    'a'  写入方式打开，将文件指针指向文件末尾。如果文件不存在则尝试创建之。
    'a+' 读写方式打开，将文件指针指向文件末尾。如果文件不存在则尝试创建之。
         创建并以写入方式打开，将文件指针指向文件头。如果文件已存在，则 fopen()
    'x'  调用失败并返回 FALSE，并生成一条 E_WARNING 级别的错误信息。如果文件不
         存在则尝试创建之。这和给底层的 open(2) 系统调用指定 O_EXCL|O_CREAT 标
         记是等价的。
    'x+' 创建并以读写方式打开，其他的行为和 'x' 一样。
         Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, it is
         created. If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to 'w'),
         nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with 'x'). The
    'c'  file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. This may be
         useful if it's desired to get an advisory lock (see flock()) before
         attempting to modify the file, as using 'w' could truncate the file
         before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate()
         can be used after the lock is requested).
    'c+' Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same
         behavior as 'c'.

        Note:

        不同的操作系统家族具有不同的行结束习惯。当写入一个文本文件并想插入一个
        新行时，需要使用符合操作系统的行结束符号。基于 Unix 的系统使用 \n 作为
        行结束字符，基于 Windows 的系统使用 \r\n 作为行结束字符，基于 Macintosh
        的系统使用 \r 作为行结束字符。

        如果写入文件时使用了错误的行结束符号，则其它应用程序打开这些文件时可能
        会表现得很怪异。

        Windows 下提供了一个文本转换标记（'t'）可以透明地将 \n 转换为 \r\n。与
        此对应还可以使用 'b' 来强制使用二进制模式，这样就不会转换数据。要使用这
        些标记，要么用 'b' 或者用 't' 作为 mode 参数的最后一个字符。

        默认的转换模式依赖于 SAPI 和所使用的 PHP 版本，因此为了便于移植鼓励总是
        指定恰当的标记。如果是操作纯文本文件并在脚本中使用了 \n 作为行结束符，
        但还要期望这些文件可以被其它应用程序例如 Notepad 读取，则在 mode 中使用
        't'。在所有其它情况下使用 'b'。

        在操作二进制文件时如果没有指定 'b' 标记，可能会碰到一些奇怪的问题，包括
        坏掉的图片文件以及关于 \r\n 字符的奇怪问题。

        Note:

        为移植性考虑，强烈建议在用 fopen() 打开文件时总是使用 'b' 标记。

        Note:

        再一次，为移植性考虑，强烈建议你重写那些依赖于 't' 模式的代码使其使用正
        确的行结束符并改成 'b' 模式。

use_include_path

    如果也需要在 include_path 中搜寻文件的话，可以将可选的第三个参数
    use_include_path 设为 '1' 或 TRUE。

context


        Note: 在 PHP 5.0.0 中增加了对上下文（Context）的支持。有关上下文（
        Context）的说明参见 Streams。

返回值

成功时返回文件指针资源，如果打开失败，本函数返回 FALSE。

错误／异常

如果打开失败，会产生一个 E_WARNING 错误。可以通过 @ 来屏蔽错误。

更新日志

版本                                    说明
      自 PHP 4.3.2 起，对所有区别二进制和文本模式的平台默认模式都被设为二进制模
4.3.2 式。如果在升级后脚本碰到问题，尝试暂时使用 't' 标记，直到所有的脚本都照以
      下所说的改为更具移植性以后。
4.3.2 增加了选项 'x' 和 'x+'
5.2.6 增加了选项 'c' 和 'c+'

范例

Example #1 fopen() 例子

<?php
$handle = fopen("/home/rasmus/file.txt", "r");
$handle = fopen("/home/rasmus/file.gif", "wb");
$handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "r");
$handle = fopen("ftp://user:password@example.com/somefile.txt", "w");
?>

注释

Warning

使用 SSL 时，Microsoft IIS 会违反协议不发送close_notify标记就关闭连接。PHP 会在
到达数据尾端时报告“SSL: Fatal Protocol Error”。要解决此问题，error_reporting 应
设定为降低级别至不包含警告。 PHP 4.3.7 及更高版本可以在使用 https:// 包装器打开
流时检测出有问题的 IIS 服务器软件并抑制警告。在使用 fsockopen() 创建 ssl:// 套
接字时, 开发者需检测并抑制此警告。

    Note: 当启用安全模式时， PHP 会在执行脚本时检查被脚本操作的目录是否与被执行
    的脚本有相同的 UID（所有者）。

    Note:

    如果在用服务器模块版本的 PHP 时在打开和写入文件上遇到问题，记住要确保所使用
    的文件和目录是服务器进程所能够访问的。

    Note:

    This function may also succeed when filename is a directory. If you are
    unsure whether filename is a file or a directory, you may need to use the 
    is_dir() function before calling fopen().

User Contributed Notes 52 notes

===============================================================================

Note - using fopen in 'w' mode will NOT update the modification time
(filemtime) of a file like you may expect. You may want to issue a touch()
after writing and closing the file which update its modification time. This may
become critical in a caching situation, if you intend to keep your hair.
===============================================================================

With php 5.2.5 on Apache 2.2.4, accessing files on an ftp server with fopen()
or readfile() requires an extra forwardslash if an absolute path is needed.

i.e., if a file called bullbes.txt is stored under /var/school/ on ftp server
example.com and you're trying to access it with user blossom and password
buttercup, the url would be:

ftp://blossom:buttercup@example.com//var/school/bubbles.txt

Note the two forwardslashes. It looks like the second one is needed so the
server won't interpret the path as relative to blossom's home on townsville.
===============================================================================

On a Windows webserver, when using fopen with a file path stored in a variable,
PHP will return an error if the variable isn't encoded in ASCII, which may be
the case if the file file path is retrieved from a database.

Possible workaround :
<?
$encoding = mb_detect_encoding($filePath);
$filePath = mb_convert_encoding($filePath, "ASCII", $encoding);
$filePath = str_replace("?", "", $filePath);
$filePath = addslashes($filePath);

if(file_exists($filePath)) {
    echo "File Found.";
    $handle       = fopen($filePath, "r");
    $fileContents = fread($handle, filesize($filePath));
    fclose($handle);
    if(!empty($fileContents)) {
        echo "<pre>".$fileContents."</pre>";
    }
}
else {
    echo "File Not Found.";
}
?>
===============================================================================

a variable $http_response_header is available when doing the fopen(). Which
contains an array of the response header.

Simple class to fetch a HTTP URL. Supports "Location:"-redirections. Useful for
servers with allow_url_fopen=false. Works with SSL-secured hosts.

While opening a file with multibyte data (Ex: données multi-octets), faced some
issues with the encoding. Got to know that it uses  windows-1250. Used iconv to
convert it to UTF-8 and it resolved the issue. 

<?php
function utf8_fopen_read($fileName) {
    $fc = iconv('windows-1250', 'utf-8', file_get_contents($fileName));
    $handle=fopen("php://memory", "rw");
    fwrite($handle, $fc);
    fseek($handle, 0);
    return $handle;
}
?>

Example usage:

<?php
$fh = utf8_fopen_read("./tpKpiBundle.csv");
while (($data = fgetcsv($fh, 1000, ",")) !== false) {
    foreach ($data as $value) {
        echo $value . "<br />\n";
    }
}
?>

Hope it helps.

If you're using fopen to open a URL that requires authorization, you might need
to force a HTTP/1.0 request for it since fopen won't support HTTP/1.1 requests.
You can do that by setting your user_agent to one that is known only to support
HTTP/1.0 (most webservers will be configured to force HTTP/1.0 for some
browsers). Here's what worked for me:

<?php
$returned=URLopen("http://$username:$password@example.com");

function URLopen($url)
{
        // Fake the browser type
        ini_set('user_agent','MSIE 4\.0b2;');

        $dh = fopen("$url",'r');
        $result = fread($dh,8192);                                             
                                                                              
        return $result;
}
?>

download: i need a function to simulate a "wget url" and do not buffer the data

I have found that I can do fopen("COM1:", "r+"); to open the comport in
windows. You have to make sure the comport isn't already open or you will get a
permission denied.

I am still playing around with this but you have to somehow flush what you send
to the comport if you are trying to communicate realtime with a device.
===============================================================================

I was wondering why was added the "x" mode, it works only if the file do not
exists, will create it and open it in read only, it's useless !!
But I found something I could do with that.

Here is a little mk_file function.

<?php
function mk_file($filename) {
    if(!is_file($filename)) {
        fclose(fopen($filename,"x")); //create the file and close it
        return true;
    } else return false; //file already exists
}
?>

You can improve it, add chmod support etc...
===============================================================================

Writing and reading on a serial port.

If you are unable or unwilling to install the serial device library for PHP,
its still possible to communicate through a serial port or USB device.

There are two issues to note:
- you must use a system call to set the port control options
- you must use NON blocking stream mode for reading (not for writing unless you
use flow control)

<?php
// Set timeout to 500 ms
$timeout=microtime(true)+0.5;

// Set device controle options (See man page for stty)
exec("/bin/stty -F /dev/ttyS0 19200 sane raw cs8 hupcl cread clocal -echo
-onlcr ");
   
// Open serial port
$fp=fopen("/dev/ttyS0","c+");
if(!$fp) die("Can't open device");

// Set blocking mode for writing
stream_set_blocking($fp,1);
fwrite($fp,"foo\n");

// Set non blocking mode for reading
stream_set_blocking($fp,0);
do{
  // Try to read one character from the device
  $c=fgetc($fp);

  // Wait for data to arive
  if($c === false){
      usleep(50000);
      continue;
  } 
 
  $line.=$c;
   
}while($c!="\n" && microtime(true)<$timeout);
 
echo "Responce: $line"; 
?>
===============================================================================

PHP will open a directory if a path with no file name is supplied. This just
bit me. I was not checking the filename part of a concatenated string.

For example:

<?php
$fd = fopen('/home/mydir/' . $somefile, 'r');
?>

Will open the directory if $somefile = ''

If you attempt to read using the file handle you will get the binary directory
contents. I tried append mode and it errors out so does not seem to be
dangerous.

This is with FreeBSD 4.5 and PHP 4.3.1. Behaves the same on 4.1.1 and PHP
4.1.2. I have not tested other version/os combinations.
===============================================================================

If you are getting message "Warning: fopen(): URL file-access is disabled in
the server configuration", you can use function below to get the content from a
local or remote file.

Function uses CURL lib, follow the link to get help: http://www.php.net/curl

<?php
/*
   * @return string
   * @param string $url
   * @desc Return string content from a remote file
   * @author Luiz Miguel Axcar (lmaxcar@yahoo.com.br)
*/

function get_content($url)
{
    $ch = curl_init();

    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);

    ob_start();

    curl_exec ($ch);
    curl_close ($ch);
    $string = ob_get_contents();

    ob_end_clean();
   
    return $string;    
}

#usage:
$content = get_content ("http://www.php.net");
var_dump ($content);
?>
===============================================================================

If you are getting a "HTTP request failed!" without further details, the socket
timeout could be expired. This default to 60 seconds. See stream_set_timeout().
===============================================================================

For the directory separators use the PHP constant DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
===============================================================================

fopen() will block if the file to be opened is a fifo. This is true whether
it's opened in "r" or "w" mode.  (See man 7 fifo: this is the correct, default
behaviour; although Linux supports non-blocking fopen() of a fifo, PHP
doesn't).
The consequence of this is that you can't discover whether an initial fifo read
/write would block because to do that you need stream_select(), which in turn
requires that fopen() has happened!
===============================================================================

[fopen note]

I have been trying unsuccessfully to upload and read a Mac OS file on a Linux
server. Lots of records show up a just one big using only the following:

<?php $fhandle = fopen($file, 'r'); ?>
  or
<?php $fhandle = fopen($file, 'rb'); ?>

It does work, however, this way:

<?php
ini_set('auto_detect_line_endings', TRUE);
$fhandle = fopen($file, 'r');
?>
===============================================================================

If you need fopen() on a URL to timeout, you can do like:
<?php
  $timeout = 3;
  $old = ini_set('default_socket_timeout', $timeout);
  $file = fopen('http://example.com', 'r');
  ini_set('default_socket_timeout', $old);
  stream_set_timeout($file, $timeout);
  stream_set_blocking($file, 0);
  //the rest is standard
?>
===============================================================================

Note that whether you may open directories is operating system dependent. The
following lines:

<?php
// Windows ($fh === false)
$fh = fopen('c:\\Temp', 'r');

// UNIX (is_resource($fh) === true)
$fh = fopen('/tmp', 'r');
?>

demonstrate that on Windows (2000, probably XP) you may not open a directory
(the error is "Permission Denied"), regardless of the security permissions on
that directory.

On UNIX, you may happily read the directory format for the native filesystem.
===============================================================================

Quick tip. If using fopen to make http requests that contain a querystring, it
is advised that you urlencode() your values, else characters like @ can make
fopen (or whatever wrapper it is using) throw an error.
===============================================================================

I was working on a consol script for win32 and noticed a few things about it. 
On win32 it appears that you can't re-open the input stream for reading, but
rather you have to open it once, and read from there on.  Also, i don't know if
this is a bug or what but it appears that fgets() reads until the new line
anyway.  The number of characters returned is ok, but it will not halt reading
and return to the script.  I don't know of a work around for this right now,
but i'll keep working on it.

This is some code to work around the close and re-open of stdin.

<?php
function read($length='255'){
    if (!isset($GLOBALS['StdinPointer'])){

If you're running PHP as apache module, it will always write files as "nobody",
"www", "httpd", (or whatever user your webserver runs as) unless you specify a
different user/group in httpd.conf, or compile apache with suexec support.
However, if you run PHP as a CGI wrapper, you may setuid the PHP executable to
whatever user you wish (*severe* security issues apply). If you really want to
be able to su to other user, I recommend compiling with suexec support.
AFAIK, PHP can't NOT use SuEXEC if apache does. If PHP is configured as an
apache module it will act as whatever user the apache is. If apache SuEXEC's to
otheruser:othergroup (e.g. root:root), that's what PHP will write files as,
because it acts as a part of apache code. I suggest you double-check your
SuEXEC configuration and settings. Note: you can't su to another user within
the PHP code -- it has to be an apache directive, either through <VirtualHost>,
or through .htaccess. Also note: I'm not sure how it all works (if it works at
all) on Win32 platforms.
Check www.apache.org to see how it's done.

There IS an option to use fopen with a proxy, it's in $context.
No need to recode everything.
===============================================================================

TIP: If you are using fopen and fread to read HTTP or FTP or Remote Files, and
experiencing some performance issues such as stalling, slowing down and
otherwise, then it's time you learned a thing called cURL.

Performance Comparison:

10 per minute for fopen/fread for 100 HTTP files
2000 per minute for cURL for 2000 HTTP files

cURL should be used for opening HTTP and FTP files, it is EXTREMELY reliable,
even when it comes to performance.

I noticed when using too many scripts at the same time to download the data
from the site I was harvesting from, fopen and fread would go into deadlock.
When using cURL i can open 50 windows, running 10 URL's from each window, and
getting the best performance possible.

Just a Tip :)
===============================================================================

With this it isn't possible to get data from another port than 80 (and 443) -
at least for me. Because of that I've made this function who gets data from
every port you want using HTTP:

<?php;
function getcontent($server, $port, $file)
{
    $cont = "";
    $ip = gethostbyname($server);
    $fp = fsockopen($ip, $port);
    if (!$fp)
    {
        return "Unknown";
    }
    else
    {
        $com = "GET $file HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\nAccept-Language: de-ch\r\
nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE
6.0; Windows NT 5.0)\r\nHost: $server:$port\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n";
        fputs($fp, $com);
        while (!feof($fp))
        {
            $cont .= fread($fp, 500);
        }
        fclose($fp);
        $cont = substr($cont, strpos($cont, "\r\n\r\n") + 4);
        return $cont;
    }
}
echo getcontent("www.myhost.com", "81", "/"));
?>

Works fine for me. Had to do this especially for a shoutcast server, which only
delivered the HTML-file if the user-agent was given.
===============================================================================

This is an addendum to ibetyouare at home dot com's note about Apache directory
permissions.  If you are on a shared host and cannot tweak Apache's permissions
directives then you might try setting the same thing in a .htaccess file. 
Failing that, if you are having trouble just creating files then  set the
directory permissions to allow writing (for whatever directory the file is
supposed to be in) and include the following before fopen():

`touch /path/to/myfile/myfile.txt`;

That will usually create a new empty file that you can write to even when fopen
fails. - PHP 4.3.0
===============================================================================

I couldn't for the life of me get a certain php script working when i moved my
server to a new Fedora 4 installation. The problem was that fopen() was failing
when trying to access a file as a URL through apache -- even though it worked
fine when run from the shell and even though the file was readily readable from
any browser.  After trying to place blame on Apache, RedHat, and even my cat
and dog, I finally ran across this bug report on Redhat's website:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=164700

Basically the problem was SELinux (which I knew nothing about) -- you have to
run the following command in order for SELinux to allow php to open a web file:

/usr/sbin/setsebool httpd_can_network_connect=1

To make the change permanent, run it with the -P option:

/usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1

Hope this helps others out -- it sure took me a long time to track down the
problem.
===============================================================================

If fopen() has been disabled for security reasons, is possible a porting FROM:

<?php
$f=fopen($file,'rb');
$data='';
while(!feof($f))
    $data.=fread($f,$size);
fclose($f);
?>

TO:

<?php
$data = file_get_contents($file); // (PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)
?>

and also a porting FROM:

<?php
$f = fopen($file,'wb');
fwrite($f,$content,strlen($content));
fclose($f);
?>

TO:

<?php
$f=file_put_contents($file, $content); // (PHP 5)
?>

For detail read the php manual.
===============================================================================

Here you have a function found on the website http://
softontherocks.blogspot.com/2014/11/
funcion-para-escribir-en-un-fichero-log.html with an example of how to make a
log file.

The function is this:

function writeLog($data) {
list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
$datetime = strftime("%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S",time());
$msg = "$datetime'". sprintf("%06s",intval($usec*1000000)).": $data";
$save_path = 'foo.txt';
$fp = @fopen($save_path, 'a'); // open or create the file for writing and
append info
fputs($fp, "$msg\n"); // write the data in the opened file
fclose($fp); // close the file
}
===============================================================================

if fopen() throws a E_WARNING "failed to open stream: HTTP request failed!" at
you when opening a valid URL that you know returns data, i advise you to do the
following before calling fopen($url,'r'):

<?php
ini_set ('user_agent', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
?>

or anyways, set that 'user_agent' with ini_set() to something valid.

thanks, pollita|at|php.net @ http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22937#c64196 , for
the clue to this
===============================================================================

Important note:

You have always to use the real path name for a file with the command fopen
[for example: fopen($filename, 'w')], never use a symbolic link, it will not
work (unable to open $filename).
===============================================================================

Note that if specifying the optional 'b' (binary) mode, it appears that it
cannot be the first letter for some unaccountable reason. In other words, "br"
doesn't work, while "rb" is ok!
===============================================================================

Since the http-wrapper doesn't support stat() and so you can't use file_exists
() for url's, you can simply use a function like this:

<?php
function http_file_exists($url)
{
$f=@fopen($url,"r");
if($f)
{
fclose($f);
return true;
}
return false;
}
?>
===============================================================================

Be aware that fopen($url) also respects HTTP status headers. If the URL
responds with a 1xx, 4xx, or 5xx status code, you will get a "failed to open
stream: HTTP request failed!", followed by the HTTP status response. Same goes
for file_get_contents($url)...
===============================================================================

If there is a file that´s excessively being rewritten by many different users,
you´ll note that two almost-simultaneously accesses on that file could
interfere with each other. For example if there´s a chat history containing
only the last 25 chat lines. Now adding a line also means deleting the very
first one. So while that whole writing is happening, another user might also
add a line, reading the file, which, at this point, is incomplete, because it´s
just being rewritten. The second user would then rewrite an incomplete file and
add its line to it, meaning: you just got yourself some data loss!

If flock() was working at all, that might be the key to not let those
interferences happen - but flock() mostly won´t work as expected (at least
that´s my experience on any linux webserver I´ve tried), and writing own
file-locking-functions comes with a lot of possible issues that would finally
result in corrupted files. Even though it´s very unlikely, it´s not impossible
and has happened to me already.

So I came up with another solution for the file-interference-problem:

1. A file that´s to be accessed will first be copied to a temp-file directory
and its last filemtime() is being stored in a PHP-variable. The temp-file gets
a random filename, ensuring no other process is able to interfere with this
particular temp-file.
2. When the temp-file has been changed/rewritten/whatever, there´ll be a check
whether the filemtime() of the original file has been changed since we copied
it into our temp-directory.
2.1. If filemtime() is still the same, the temp-file will just be renamed/moved
to the original filename, ensuring the original file is never in a temporary
state - only the complete previous state or the complete new state.
2.2. But if filemtime() has been changed while our PHP-process wanted to change
its file, the temp-file will just be deleted and our new PHP-fileclose-function
will return a FALSE, enabling whatever called that function to do it again (ie.
upto 5 times, until it returns TRUE).

These are the functions I´ve written for that purpose:

<?php
$dir_fileopen = "../AN/INTERNAL/DIRECTORY/fileopen";

function randomid() {
    return time().substr(md5(microtime()), 0, rand(5, 12));
}

function cfopen($filename, $mode, $overwriteanyway = false) {
    global $dir_fileopen;
    clearstatcache();
    do {
        $id = md5(randomid(rand(), TRUE));
        $tempfilename = $dir_fileopen."/".$id.md5($filename);
    } while(file_exists($tempfilename));
    if (file_exists($filename)) {
        $newfile = false;
        copy($filename, $tempfilename);
    }else{
        $newfile = true;
    }
    $fp = fopen($tempfilename, $mode);
    return $fp ? array($fp, $filename, $id, @filemtime($filename), $newfile, 
$overwriteanyway) : false;
}

function cfwrite($fp,$string) { return fwrite($fp[0], $string); }

function cfclose($fp, $debug = "off") {
    global $dir_fileopen;
    $success = fclose($fp[0]);
    clearstatcache();
    $tempfilename = $dir_fileopen."/".$fp[2].md5($fp[1]);
    if ((@filemtime($fp[1]) == $fp[3]) or ($fp[4]==true and !file_exists($fp[1
])) or $fp[5]==true) {
        rename($tempfilename, $fp[1]);
    }else{
        unlink($tempfilename);
        if ($debug != "off") echo "While writing, another process accessed $fp[
1]. To ensure file-integrity, your changes were rejected.";
        $success = false;
    }
    return $success;
}
?>

$overwriteanyway, one of the parameters for cfopen(), means: If cfclose() is
used and the original file has changed, this script won´t care and still
overwrite the original file with the new temp file. Anyway there won´t be any
writing-interference between two PHP processes, assuming there can be no
absolute simultaneousness between two (or more) processes.
===============================================================================

using fopen to upload a file through ftp cannot overwrite that file - use curl
instead
===============================================================================

If you want to open large files (more than 2GB) that's what I did and it works:
you should recompile your php with the CFLAGS="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" ./
configure etc... This tells to your compiler (I tested only gcc on PHP-4.3.4
binary on Linux and Solaris) to make the PHP parser binary large file aware.
This way fopen() will not give you the "Value too large for defined data type"
error message.
God bless PHP
ciao
Sergio Paternoster
===============================================================================

While adding CFLAGS="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" immediately before calling "./
configure" on the PHP source will enable support for using fopen() on large
files (greater than 2 GB), note that -- if such an installation of PHP is used
in conjunction with Apache HTTPD [2.x], Apache will become completely
unresponsive even when not serving output from a PHP application.

In order to gain large file support for non-web applications while maintaining
the operability of Apache, consider making two distinct PHP installations:  one
with the above CFLAGS specified during configuration (for non-web uses), and
the other without this flag (for use with Apache).
===============================================================================

Hello all. I have had trouble getting files through proxy, and the solution
posted above only works if the requested file is also hosted on the proxy
server (which is quite unlikely). so I've put together the following functions
pfopen & preadfile. they quite work like the replaced fopen & readfile, and
will resort to them if no proxy is provided :)

<?php
function preadfile($_url, $_proxy_name = null, $_proxy_port = 4480){
  if(is_null($_proxy_name) || LOCAL_TEST){
    return readfile($_url);
  }else{
    $proxy_cont = '';

    $proxy_fp = pfopen($_url, $_proxy_name, $_proxy_port);
    while(!feof($proxy_fp)) {$proxy_cont .= fread($proxy_fp,4096);}
    fclose($proxy_fp);

    $proxy_cont = substr($proxy_cont, strpos($proxy_cont,"\r\n\r\n")+4);
    echo $proxy_cont;
    return count($proxy_cont);
  }
}
function pfopen($_url, $_proxy_name = null, $_proxy_port = 4480) {
  if(is_null($_proxy_name) || LOCAL_TEST){
    return fopen($_url);
  }else{
    $proxy_fp = fsockopen($_proxy_name, $_proxy_port);
    if (!$proxy_fp) return false;
    $host= substr($_url, 7);
    $host = substr($bucket, 0, strpos($host, "/"));

    $request = "GET $_url HTTP/1.0\r\nHost:$host\r\n\r\n";

    fputs($proxy_fp, $request);

    return $proxy_fp;
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Also a small function useful for backup for example. It's a mixed between the
fopen() and the mkdir() functions.

This function opens a file but also make the path recursively where the file is
contained. This is helpful for ending to finish with "No such file or directory
in" errors

<?php
function fopen_recursive($path, $mode, $chmod=0755){
  preg_match('`^(.+)/([a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-z]+)$`i', $path, $matches);
  $directory = $matches[1];
  $file = $matches[2];

  if (!is_dir($directory)){
    if (!mkdir($directory, $chmod, 1)){
    return FALSE;
    }
  }
return fopen ($path, $mode);
}
?>
===============================================================================

fopen() and PROXY

I wondered why there is no possibility to use fopen() through a proxy in php.
The solution posted above did not work for me.

This little function gets http through a given proxy:

<?php
function proxy_url($proxy_url)
{
    $proxy_name = '127.0.0.1';
    $proxy_port = 4001;
    $proxy_cont = '';

    $proxy_fp = fsockopen($proxy_name, $proxy_port);
    if (!$proxy_fp)    {return false;}
    fputs($proxy_fp, "GET $proxy_url HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: $proxy_name\r\n\r\n");
    while(!feof($proxy_fp)) {$proxy_cont .= fread($proxy_fp,4096);}
    fclose($proxy_fp);
    $proxy_cont = substr($proxy_cont, strpos($proxy_cont,"\r\n\r\n")+4);
    return $proxy_cont;
}
?>
===============================================================================

The issue involving some sites requiring a valid user-agent string when using
fopen can easily be resolved by setting the user_agent string in the PHP.INI
file.

If you do not have access to the PHP.INI file, then the use of

ini_set('user_agent','Mozilla: (compatible; Windows XP)');

should also work.

The actual agent string is up to you. If you want to identify to the sites that
you are using PHP ...

ini_set('user_agent','PHP');

would do.

Richard Quadling.
===============================================================================

It seems that fopen() errors when you attempt opening a url starting with HTTP:
// as opposed to http:// - it is case sensitive.  In 4.3.1 anyway..."HTTP://",
by not matching "http://" will tell the wrapper to look locally.  From the
looks of the source, the same goes for HTTPS vs https, etc.
===============================================================================

To overwrite a file with a new content without deleting it, and without
changing the owner or access rights, it's best to not use:

<?php
$file = fopen($filename, 'r+b'); // binary update mode
//...
ftruncate($file, 0);
fwrite($file, $my_stuff);
//...
fclose($file);
?>

but instead the faster one:

<?php
$file = fopen($filename, 'r+b); // binary update mode
//...
rewind($file);
fwrite($file, $my_stuff);
fflush($file);
ftruncate($file, ftell($file));
//...
fclose($file);
?>

The reason is that truncating a file at size 0 forces the OS to deallocate all
storage clusters used by the file, before you write your content which will be
reallocated on disk.

The second code simply overwrites the existing content where it is already
located on disk, and truncates any remaining bytes that may exist (if the new
content is shorter than the old content). The "r+b" mode allows access for both
read and write: the file can be kept opened after reading it and before
rewriting the modified content.

It's particularly useful for files that are accessed often or have a size
larger than a few kilobytes, as it saves lots of system I/O, and also limits
the filesystem fragmentation if the updated file is quite large.

And this method also works if the file is locked exclusively once opened (but I
would rather recommend using another empty file for locking purpose, opened
with "a+" access mode, in "/var/lock/yourapp/*" or other fast filesystems where
filelocks are easily monitored and where the webserver running PHP is allowed
to create and update lock files, and not forgetting to close the lock file
after closing the content file).
===============================================================================

Check for UTF-8 content in fread after fopen:
For checking the UTF-8 content I use the function 'htmlentities();'
Example:
<?php
$filename = "CONTENT.htm";
$handle = fopen($filename, "r");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
// Check for UTF-8 content
if(htmlentities(utf8_decode($contents))){
    $contents = htmlentities(utf8_decode($contents));
}else{
    $contents = htmlentities($contents);
}
?>
===============================================================================

I had to switch from relative paths to full paths when my web host recently
migrated the server onto their hosting cloud.  This used to work for me:

<?php
$fplog = fopen('ipn.log','a');
?>

After the migration, however, I received the following error message:

Warning: fopen(ipn.log) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: Permission
denied in D:\home\server_name\log_test.php on line 21

I had to change the code to the following to get it to work:

<?php
$logfile = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'\\ipn.log';
$fplog = fopen($logfile,'a');
?>
===============================================================================

when using ssl / https on windows i would get the error:
"Warning: fopen(https://example.com): failed to open stream: Invalid argument
in someSpecialFile.php on line 4344534"

This was because I did not have the extension "php_openssl.dll" enabled.

So if you have the same problem, goto your php.ini file and enable it :)
===============================================================================

The following is an  example of file locking used in a function to share an
array between processes.
In this example the function reads the array, possibly remove stuff like spend
semaphores and insert new stuff to share.
The file gets locked for writing thus making sure that two processes doesn't
inadvertently delete each others data.

The function can be called multiple times during a script, which becomes
increasingly important if you write HTML5 Server Sent Events and websockets
apps, since the script dose not end when the page are loaded. (there are other
issues with that like garbage collection and memory leaks)
Using the “c” mode of fopen, removes the (remote) change of a race condition to
the file lock.

Be aware that the function filesize() is not working correctly when files are
in cash memory. You could flush the cash or in this case, since the file size
of IPC are neglectable, just give a very large number as length parameter to
fread.

<?php
function ipc($new_record=""){
  $update=false;

  // Open file with locking
  $handle=fopen("example.dat","c+");
 
  // Lock the file for writing
  flock($handle,LOCK_EX);

  // Get file size.
  // you can either fluch the file cash to get an acurate number
  // clearstatcache();
  // Or use a large number   

  // Load event file into array
  $contents=fread($handle,10000000);

  $ipc_array=json_decode($contents,true);

  // Clean out old stuff
  if(is_array($ipc_array)){
    $timeout=time()-60; 
    foreach($ipc_array as $key=>$record){
      // eg remove spend semaphores or timed out messages
      if( $record['time'] < $timeout ){
        unset($ipc_array[$key]);
        $update=true;
      }
    }
  }

  // Add new message
  if(is_array($new_record)){
    $new_record['time']=time();
    $ipc_array[]=$new_record;
    $update=true;
  }

  // Write file and end
  if($update){
    // Overwrite the old data
    ftruncate($handle,0);
    rewind($handle);
 
    // Write the new array to file
    fwrite($handle,json_encode($ipc_array,JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK));
  }

  // Unlock the file - you have to do it! it doesn't happen on fclose
  flock($handle,LOCK_UN);

  // Close the file     
  fclose($handle);

  return $ipc_array;
}

// Read messages
$ipc=ipc();

// Show messages
foreach( $ipc as $record)
  echo $record['message'] ."<br>\n";

// Send a message
$message["message"]="hello world.";
$message["foo"]="bar";
$ipc=ipc($message);
?>
===============================================================================

Here is how you could modify file's contents by only opening it once in "r+"
mode:

<?php
$filePath = '/path/to/file';
if( !@$fh = fopen($filePath, 'r+') ) {
  die("Could not open $filePath in READ+WRITE mode");
}

// Extract contents
$contents = fread($fh, filesize($filePath));

// ..modify $contents in any way you need..

// Truncate file (important to move the pointer first)
fseek($fh, 0);
ftruncate($fh, 0);

// Write
fwrite($fh, $contents);

fclose($fh);
?>
===============================================================================

If you open a file with r+ and execute an fwrite(), writing less to the file
than what it originally was, it will result in the difference being padded with
the end of the file from the previous end of the file. Example:

<?php
// Open file for read and string modification
$file = "/test";
$fh = fopen($file, 'r+');
$contents = fread($fh, filesize($file));
$new_contents = str_replace("hello world", "hello", $contents);
fclose($fh);

// Open file to write
$fh = fopen($file, 'r+');
fwrite($fh, $new_contents);
fclose($fh);
?>

If the end of the file was "abcdefghij", you will notice that the difference in
"hello world" and "hello", 6 characters, will be appended to the file,
resulting in the new ending: "efghij". To obviate this, fopen() with +w
instead, which truncates the file to zero length.

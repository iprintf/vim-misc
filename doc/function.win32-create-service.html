win32_create_service — Creates a new service entry in the SCM database

说明

mixed win32_create_service ( array $details [, string $machine ] )

参数

details

    An array of service details:

    service

        The short name of the service. This is the name that you will use to
        control the service using the net command. The service must be unique
        (no two services can share the same name), and, ideally, should avoid
        having spaces in the name.

    display

        The display name of the service. This is the name that you will see in
        the Services Applet.

    description

        The long description of the service. This is the description that you
        will see in the Services Applet.

    user

        The name of the user account under which you want the service to run.
        If omitted, the service will run as the LocalSystem account. If the
        username is specified, you must also provide a password.

    password

        The password that corresponds to the user.

    path

        The full path to the executable module that will be launched when the
        service is started. If omitted, the path to the current PHP process
        will be used.

    params

        Command line parameters to pass to the service when it starts. If you
        want to run a PHP script as the service, then the first parameter
        should be the full path to the PHP script that you intend to run. If
        the script name or path contains spaces, then wrap the full path to the
        PHP script with ".

    load_order

        Controls the load_order. This is not yet fully supported.

    svc_type

        Sets the service type. If omitted, the default value is
        WIN32_SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS. Don't change this unless you know what
        you're doing.

    start_type

        Specifies how the service should be started. The default is
        WIN32_SERVICE_AUTO_START which means the service will be launched when
        the machine starts up.

    error_control

        Informs the SCM what it should do when it detects a problem with the
        service. The default is WIN32_SERVER_ERROR_IGNORE. Changing this value
        is not yet fully supported.

    delayed_start

        If delayed_start is set to TRUE, then this will inform the SCM that
        this service should be started after other auto-start services are
        started plus a short delay.

        Any service can be marked as a delayed auto-start service; however,
        this setting has no effect unless the service's start_type is
        WIN32_SERVICE_AUTO_START.

        This setting is only applicable on Windows Vista and Windows Server
        2008 or greater.

    base_priority

        To reduce the impact on processor utilisation, it may be necessary to
        set a base priority lower than normal.

        The base_priority can be set to one of the constants define in Win32
        Base Priority Classes.

machine

    The optional machine name on which you want to create a service. If
    omitted, it will use the local machine.

返回值

成功时返回 WIN32_NO_ERROR，参数错误时返回 FALSE，或失败时返回一个 Win32 错误码
。

范例

Example #1 A win32_create_service() example

Create a service with the short name 'dummyphp'.

<?php
$x = win32_create_service(array(
    'service'     => 'dummyphp',                                           #
 the name of your service
    'display'     => 'sample dummy PHP service',                           #
 short description
    'description' => 'This is a dummy Windows service created using PHP.', #
 long description
    'params'      => '"' . __FILE__ . '"  run',                            #
 path to the script and parameters
));
debug_zval_dump($x);
?>

Other start_type values:

0x00000002: A service started automatically by the service control manager
during system startup. For more information, see Automatically Starting
Services.

0x00000000: A device driver started by the system loader. This value is valid
only for driver services.

0x00000003: A service started by the service control manager when a process
calls the win32_start_service() function.

0x00000004: A service that cannot be started. Attempts to start the service
result in the error code

0x00000001: A device driver started by the IoInitSystem function. This value is
valid only for driver services.

I can confirm that 0x00000003 works as expected (service is created, but must
be started manually).

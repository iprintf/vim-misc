The EvChild class

(PECL ev >= 0.2.0)

简介

EvChild watchers trigger when the process receives a SIGCHLD in response to
some child status changes (most typically when a child dies or exits). It is
permissible to install an EvChild watcher after the child has been forked(which
implies it might have already exited), as long as the event loop isn't entered
(or is continued from a watcher), i.e. forking and then immediately registering
a watcher for the child is fine, but forking and registering a watcher a few
event loop iterations later or in the next callback invocation is not.

It is allowed to register EvChild watchers in the default loop only.

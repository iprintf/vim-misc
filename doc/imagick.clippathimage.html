(PECL imagick 2.0.0)

Imagick::clipPathImage — Clips along the named paths from the 8BIM profile

说明

bool Imagick::clipPathImage ( string $pathname , bool $inside )

Clips along the named paths from the 8BIM profile, if present. Later operations
take effect inside the path. It may be a number if preceded with #, to work on
a numbered path, e.g., "#1" to use the first path.

参数

pathname

    The name of the path

inside

    If TRUE later operations take effect inside clipping path. Otherwise later
    operations take effect outside clipping path.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE。

错误／异常

错误时抛出 ImagickException。

I found Imagick::clipPathImage and Imagic::clipImage did not work as I had
expected. I thought they would just clip the path and throw away the extra data
and you are done. Not the case.

Here is how I was able to use a clipping path:

<?php
      $img = new Imagick("/Path/To/Test/Image.psd");
      $geometry = $img->getImageGeometry();

      // Uses the first path as the clipping path
      $img->clipPathImage("#1", false);

      // Fill the clipped part with a color
      $draw = new ImagickDraw();
      $draw->setFillColor("#000000");
      $draw->color(0,0, imagick::PAINT_RESET);
      $img->drawImage($draw);

      // Composite the clipped image with the old image. Set the color of the
composite to any color you want to be the outside part.
      $composite = new Imagick($path);
      $composite->newImage( $geometry['width'], $geometry['height'], new 
ImagickPixel("white"), 'png');
      $composite->compositeImage($img, imagick::COMPOSITE_COPY, 0, 0);
?>

Then doing any resizing or creating thumbnails from the resulting image 
disregarded all the previous commands so I "saved" it and started with a new
Imagick object

<?php
      // Copy the image so clip is "saved"
      $clipped = new Imagick();
      $clipped->readImageBlob($composite->getImageBlob());
?>

I'm sure there is a simpler way, but this took me awhile to get right and there
were some hurdles to cross so I hope it is able to help someone on the way.

This is all the convert equivalent of:

$ convert Test.psd -fill white -colorspace rgb -draw "color 0 0 reset" -clip
-colorspace rgb -draw "Image Copy 0,0 0,0 'Test.psd'" OutputFile.png

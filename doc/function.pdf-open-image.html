Ok, according to the PDFlib docs,

bpc - only for imagetype raw (required in this case).  The number of bits per
component.  Must be 1,2,4 or 8

components - only for imagetype raw (required in this case). The number of
image components.  Must be 1, 3 or 4.

Read the docs (page 171) for a full list of params I assume are used for the
last argument.

If you want to open a TIFF image, you have to use pdf_open_image_file().  If
you want to open a TIFF image from memory, you'll have to wait until version
5.  I gleaned this from the PDFlib folks themselves:

> from rp@pdflib.com
The only way to open TIFF with PDFlib 4 is to open it from
file. But in PDFlib 5 (http://www.pdflib.com/beta/) we add
a virtual file system, so you can easy open a file from
memory.
===============================================================================

if you ahve pdflib v4 or higher, you may also use TIFF images, by specifying
'tiff'  in the image type.

checked the pdflib documentation, tried it out, it works.
===============================================================================

a quick example:

$pdfimage = pdf_open_image_file($pdf, "jpeg", "test.jpg");
pdf_place_image($pdf, $pdfimage, 10, 10, 0.6);

...
pdf_close etc..

:-))

and Thomas Merz answered:

Nope. Unfortunately PDF supports _nearly_ everything needed
to decode GIFs internally (as with JPEG), but some minor
feature is missing. It seems Adobe also realized this --
they added the missing link in PostScript 3, so chances are
it will appear in PDF 1.4 or something...

Since the PDF_open_image() interface is meant for dumping
the image data to the PDF without any further interpretation,
it can't support GIF.

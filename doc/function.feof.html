(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

feof — 测试文件指针是否到了文件结束的位置

说明

bool feof ( resource $handle )

测试文件指针是否到了文件结束的位。

参数

handle

    文件指针必须是有效的，必须指向由 fopen() 或 fsockopen() 成功打开的文件(并还
    未由 fclose() 关闭)。

返回值

如果文件指针到了 EOF 或者出错时则返回 TRUE，否则返回一个错误（包括 socket 超时
），其它情况则返回 FALSE。

注释

Warning

如果服务器没有关闭由 fsockopen() 所打开的连接，feof() 会一直等待直到超时。要解
决这个问题可参见以下范例：

Example #1 处理 feof() 的超时

<?php
function safe_feof($fp, &$start = NULL) {
 $start = microtime(true);

 return feof($fp);
}

/* $fp 的赋值是由之前 fsockopen() 打开  */

$start = NULL;
$timeout = ini_get('default_socket_timeout');

while(!safe_feof($fp, $start) && (microtime(true) - $start) < $timeout)
{
 /* Handle */
}
?>

Warning

如果传递的文件指针无效可能会陷入无限循环中，因为 feof() 不会返回 TRUE。

Example #2 使用无效文件指针的 feof() 例子

<?php
// 如果文件不可读取或者不存在，fopen 函数返回 FALSE
$file = @fopen("no_such_file", "r");

// 来自 fopen 的 FALSE 会发出一条警告信息并在这里陷入无限循环
while (!feof($file)) {
}

fclose($file);
?>

When using feof() on a TCP stream, i found the following to work (after many
hours of frustration and anger):

NOTE: I used ";" to denote the end of data transmission.  This can be modified
to whatever the server's end of file or in this case, end of output character
is.

<?php
        $cursor = "";
        $inData = "";

        while(strcmp($cursor, ";") != 0) {
            $cursor = fgetc($sock);
            $inData.= $cursor;
        }
        fclose($sock);
        echo($inData);
?>

Since strcmp() returns 0 when the two strings are equal, it will return non
zero as long as the cursor is not ";".  Using the above method will add ";" to
the string, but the fix for this is simple.

<?php
        $cursor = "";
        $inData = "";

         $cursor = fgetc($sock);
        while(strcmp($cursor, ";") != 0) {
            $inData.= $cursor;
        }
        fclose($sock);
        echo($inData);
?>

I hope this helps someone.

Don't use feof to test if you have readed all data sent by the other end of the
socket. As i know it would return true only when the other end closes the
connection.
===============================================================================

I really thought that the feof() was TRUE when the logical file pointer is a
EOF.
but no !
we need to read and get an empty record before the eof() reports TRUE.

So

$fp = fopen('test.bin','rb');
while(!feof($fp)) {
  $c = fgetc($fp);
  // ... do something with $c
  echo ftell($fp), ",";
}
echo 'EOF!';

prints for two time the last byte position.
If our file length is 5 byte this code prints

0,1,2,3,4,5,5,EOF!

Because of this, you have to do another check to verify if fgetc really reads
another byte (to prevent error on "do something with $c" ^_^).

To prevent errors you have to use this code

$fp = fopen('test.bin','rb');
while(!feof($fp)) {
  $c = fgetc($fp);
  if($c === false) break;
  // ... do something with $c
}

but this is the same of

$fp = fopen('test.bin','rb');
while(($c = fgetc($fp))!==false) {
  // ... do something with $c
}

Consequently feof() is simply useless.
Before write this note I want to submit this as a php bug but one php developer
said that this does not imply a bug in PHP itself (http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?
id=35136&edit=2).

If this is not a bug I think that this need at least to be noticed.

Sorry for my bad english.
Bye ;)

feof() is, in fact, reliable.  However, you have to use it carefully in
conjunction with fgets().  A common (but incorrect) approach is to try
something like this:

<?
$fp = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
while (!feof($fp)) {
  $current_line = fgets($fp);
  // do stuff to the current line here
}
fclose($fp);
?>

The problem when processing plain text files is that feof() will not return
true after getting the last line of input.  You need to try to get input _and
fail_ before feof() returns true.  You can think of the loop above working like
this:

* (merrily looping, getting lines and processing them)
* fgets used to get 2nd to last line
* line is processed
* loop back up -- feof returns false, so do the steps inside the loop
* fgets used to get last line
* line is processed
* loop back up -- since the last call to fgets worked (you got the last line),
feof still returns false, so you do the steps inside the loop again
* fgets used to try to get another line (but there's nothing there!)
* your code doesn't realize this, and tries to process this non-existent line
(typically by doing the same actions again)
* now when your code loops back up, feof returns true, and your loop ends

There's two ways to solve this:

1. You can put an additional test for feof() inside the loop
2. You can move around your calls to fgets() so that the testing of feof()
happens in a better location

Here's solution 1:

<?
$fp = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
while(!feof($fp)) {
  $current_line = fgets($fp);
  if (!feof($fp)) {
    // process current line
  }
}
fclose($fp);
?>

And here's solution 2 (IMHO, more elegant):

<?
$fp = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
$current_line = fgets($fp);
while (!feof($fp)) {
  // process current line
  $current_line = fgets($fp);
}
fclose($fp);
?>

FYI, the eof() function in C++ works the exact same way, so this isn't just
some weird PHP thing...
===============================================================================

Return values in the documentation are incorrectly stated. It says:

Returns TRUE if the file pointer is at EOF or an error occurs (including socket
timeout); otherwise returns FALSE.

Correct text would be more like:

Returns FALSE if no filehandle was passed;
returns NULL if no filehandle was passed;
returns TRUE if the file pointer is at EOF or an error occurs (including socket
timeout);
otherwise returns FALSE.

As an example, running the following from the commandline:

php -r 'echo
    "Empty: ".var_export(feof(), true)."\n".
    "Null: ".var_export(feof(NULL), true)."\n".
    "Undefined: ".var_export(feof($undef), true)."\n"
;'

This will output:

PHP Warning:  Wrong parameter count for feof() in Command line code on line 1
PHP Warning:  feof(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in
Command line code on line 1
PHP Warning:  feof(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in
Command line code on line 1

Empty: NULL
Null: false
Undefined: false

This can, as other commenters have reported, result in infinite loops and
massive PHP error logfiles, if the file handle returned by fopen() is invalid
for any reason.
===============================================================================

Here's solution 3:

<?
$fp = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
while ( ($current_line = fgets($fp)) !== false ) {
  // do stuff to the current line here
}
fclose($fp);
?>

AFAICS fgets() never returns an empty string, so we can also write:

<?
$fp = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
while ( $current_line = fgets($fp) ) {
  // do stuff to the current line here
}
fclose($fp);
?>
===============================================================================

I found feof() to be a slow function when using a non-blocking connection.

The function stream_get_meta_data() returns much quicker and has a return field
'eof'.
===============================================================================

if you're worried the file pointer is invalid, TEST IT before you go into your
loop... that way it'll never be an infinite loop.
===============================================================================

To avoid infinite loops and the warning :
"Warning: feof() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given"

You need to check that the fopen function return the correct type.
This can be achieved very easily with gettype().
Here is an example :

$source = fopen($xml_uri, "r");
$xml = "";
                   
if(gettype($source) == "resource") { // Check here !
    while (!feof($source)) {
        $xml .= fgets($source, 4096);
    }
}

echo $xml;
===============================================================================

From washington dot edu css342:
On unix/linux, every line in a file has an End-Of-Line (EOL) character and the
EOF character is after the last line. On windows, each line has an EOL
characters except the last line. So unix/linux file's last line is
      stuff, EOL, EOF
whereas windows file's last line, if the cursor is on the line, is
      stuff, EOF

So set up data files on windows to be the same as on unix/linux. This way, you
will correctly determine eof under both unix/linux and windows. In general, you
must exit all loops and all functions immediately when you are attempting to
read an item that would be past the eof.

Here is a typical set up that will work correctly. Suppose in a data file,
there are multiple lines of data. In some function is the loop where you are
reading and handling this data. This loop will look similar to the following.
     // infinite loop to read and handle a line of data
     for (;;) {
        $ln = fgets($fp);
        if (feof($fp)) break;

        // read the rest of the line
        // do whatever with data
     }
If you dislike infinite loops, you can accomplish this same thing using a while
loop by priming the loop and reading again at the end:
    $ln = fgets($fp);
     while (!feof($fp)) {
        // read the rest of the line
        // do whatever with data

        $ln = fgets($fp);
     }
===============================================================================

Please note that feof() used with TCP-Connections, returns false as long as the
connection is open.
It even returns false when there is no data available.

BTW: Using feof() with HTTP for a single request, you should always make sure
that you set the HTTP-Header "Connection" to "close" and _not_ to "keep-alive".
===============================================================================

Johannes: Remember note from stream_get_meta_data page: For socket streams this
member [eof] can be TRUE  even when unread_bytes  is non-zero. To determine if
there is more data to be read, use feof() instead of reading this item.

Another thing: better not rely on the "including socket timeout" part of when
feof returns true. Just found program looping two days in while(!feof($fd))
fread ... with 20 seconds timeout in PHP 4.3.10.
===============================================================================

To avoid infinite loop with fgets() just use do..while statement.

<?php
if ($f = fopen('myfile.txt', 'r')) do {
    $line = fgets($f);
    // do any stuff here...
} while (!feof($f));
fclose($f);
===============================================================================

if you use fseek function to pos the pointer exceed the size the file,feof
still return true.so note that when you use feof as the condition of while
loop.
===============================================================================

you  can avoid the infinite loop and filling the error logs
by an simple if statement
Here is the example

    $handle = fopen("http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?p=AYXX0008&u=f",
"r");
    $xml = "";
    if ($handle)
    {
       while (!feof($handle))
       {
           $xml .= fread($handle, 128);
       }
        fclose($handle);
    }
===============================================================================

if you hit an feof() infinite loop, watch out for resultant humongous logs,
they can cripple a site with hard disk usage limits or run up excess usage
fees.

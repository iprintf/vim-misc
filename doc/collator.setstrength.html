The » ICU Collation Service supports many levels of comparison (named "Levels",
but also known as "Strengths"). Having these categories enables ICU to sort
strings precisely according to local conventions. However, by allowing the
levels to be selectively employed, searching for a string in text can be
performed with various matching conditions.

 1. Primary Level: Typically, this is used to denote differences between base
    characters (for example, "a" < "b"). It is the strongest difference. For
    example, dictionaries are divided into different sections by base
    character. This is also called the level1 strength.

 2. Secondary Level: Accents in the characters are considered secondary
    differences (for example, "as" < "às" < "at"). Other differences between
    letters can also be considered secondary differences, depending on the
    language. A secondary difference is ignored when there is a primary
    difference anywhere in the strings. This is also called the level2
    strength.


        Note:

        Note: In some languages (such as Danish), certain accented letters are
        considered to be separate base characters. In most languages, however,
        an accented letter only has a secondary difference from the unaccented
        version of that letter.

 3. Tertiary Level: Upper and lower case differences in characters are
    distinguished at the tertiary level (for example, "ao" < "Ao" < "aò"). In
    addition, a variant of a letter differs from the base form on the tertiary
    level (such as "A" and " "). Another example is the difference between
    large and small Kana. A tertiary difference is ignored when there is a
    primary or secondary difference anywhere in the strings. This is also
    called the level3 strength.

 4. Quaternary Level: When punctuation is ignored (see Ignoring Punctuations )
    at level 13, an additional level can be used to distinguish words with and
    without punctuation (for example, "ab" < "a-b" < "aB"). This difference is
    ignored when there is a primary, secondary or tertiary difference. This is
    also known as the level4 strength. The quaternary level should only be used
    if ignoring punctuation is required or when processing Japanese text (see
    Hiragana processing).

 5. Identical Level: When all other levels are equal, the identical level is
    used as a tiebreaker. The Unicode code point values of the NFD form of each
    string are compared at this level, just in case there is no difference at
    levels 14. For example, Hebrew cantillation marks are only distinguished at
    this level. This level should be used sparingly, as only code point values
    differences between two strings is an extremely rare occurrence. Using this
    level substantially decreases the performance for both incremental
    comparison and sort key generation (as well as increasing the sort key
    length). It is also known as level 5 strength.

For example, people may choose to ignore accents or ignore accents and case
when searching for text. Almost all characters are distinguished by the first
three levels, and in most locales the default value is thus Tertiary. However,
if Alternate is set to be Shifted, then the Quaternary strength can be used to
break ties among whitespace, punctuation, and symbols that would otherwise be
ignored. If very fine distinctions among characters are required, then the
Identical strength can be used (for example, Identical Strength distinguishes
between the Mathematical Bold Small A and the Mathematical Italic Small A.).
However, using levels higher than Tertiary the Identical strength result in
significantly longer sort keys, and slower string comparison performance for
equal strings.

参数

coll

    Collator object.

strength

    Strength to set.

    Possible values are:
      □ Collator::PRIMARY

      □ Collator::SECONDARY

      □ Collator::TERTIARY

      □ Collator::QUATERNARY

      □ Collator::IDENTICAL

      □ Collator::DEFAULT_STRENGTH

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 collator_set_strength() example

<?php
$arr  = array( 'aò', 'Ao', 'ao' );
$coll = collator_create( 'en_US' );

// Sort array using default strength.
collator_sort( $coll, $arr ); 
var_export( $arr );

// Sort array using primary strength.
collator_set_strength( $coll, Collator::PRIMARY );
collator_sort( $coll, $arr );
var_export( $arr );
?>

以上例程会输出：

array (
  0 => 'ao',
  1 => 'Ao',
  2 => 'aò',
)
array (
  0 => 'aò',
  1 => 'Ao',
  2 => 'ao',
)

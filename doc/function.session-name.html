session_name

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_name — 读取/设置会话名称

说明

string session_name ([ string $name ] )

session_name() 函数返回当前会话名称。如果指定 name 参数， session_name() 函数会
更新会话名称，并返回原来的会话名称。

请求开始的时候，会话名称会被重置并且存储到 session.name 配置项。因此，要想设置
会话名称，那么对于每个请求，都需要在调用 session_start() 或者 session_register
() 函数之前调用 session_name() 函数。

参数

name

    用在 cookie 或者 URL 中的会话名称，例如：PHPSESSID。只能使用字母和数字作为
    会话名称，建议尽可能的短一些，并且是望文知意的名字（对于启用了 cookie 警告
    的用户来说，方便其判断是否要允许此 cookie）。如果指定了 name 参数，那么当前
    会话也会使用指定值作为名称。

    Warning

    会话名称至少需要一个字母，不能全部都使用数字，否则，每次都会生成一个新的会
    话 ID。

返回值

返回当前会话名称。如果指定 name 参数，那么此函数会更新会话名称，并且返回原来的
会话名称。

范例

Example #1 session_name() 示例

<?php

/* 设置会话名称为 WebsiteID */

$previous_name = session_name("WebsiteID");

echo "The previous session name was $previous_name<br />";
?>

This may sound no-brainer: the session_name() function will have no essential
effect if you set session.auto_start to "true" in php.ini . And the obvious
explanation is the session already started thus cannot be altered before the
session_name() function--wherever it is in the script--is executed, same reason
session_name needs to be called before session_start() as documented.

I know it is really not a big deal. But I had a quite hard time before figuring
this out, and hope it might be helpful to someone like me.
===============================================================================

if you try to name a php session "example.com" it gets converted to
"example_com" and everything breaks.

don't use a period in your session name.
===============================================================================

Remember, kids--you MUST use session_name() first if you want to use
session_set_cookie_params() to, say, change the session timeout. Otherwise it
won't work, won't give any error, and nothing in the documentation (that I've
seen, anyway) will explain why.

Thanks to brandan of bildungsroman.com who left a note under
session_set_cookie_params() explaining this or I'd probably still be throwing
my hands up about it.
===============================================================================

For those wondering, this function is expensive!

On a script that was executing in a consistent 0.0025 seconds, just the use of
session_name("foo") shot my execution time up to ~0.09s. By simply sacrificing
session_name("foo"), I sped my script up by roughly 0.09 seconds.
===============================================================================

As  Joseph Dalrymple said, adding session_name do slow down a little bit the
execution time.
But, what i've observed is that it decreased the fluctuation between requests.
Requests on my script fluctuated between 0,045 and 0,022 seconds. With
session_name("myapp"), it goes to 0,050 and 0,045. Not a big deal, but that's a
point to note.

For those with problems setting the name, when session.auto_start is set to 1,
you need to set the session.name on php.ini!
===============================================================================

One gotcha I have noticed with session_name is that it will trigger a WARNING
level error if the cookie or GET/POST variable value has something other than
alphanumeric characters in it.  If your site displays warnings and uses PHP
sessions this may be a way to enumerate at least some of your scripts: 

http://example.com/foo.php?session_name_here=(bad)

Warning: session_start(): The session id contains invalid characters, valid
characters are only a-z, A-Z and 0-9 in /some/path/foo.php on line 666

I did not see anything in the docs suggesting that one had to sanitize the PHP
session ID values before opening the session but that appears to be the case.

Unfortunately session_name() always returns true so you have to actually get to
the point of assigning variables values before you know whether you have been
passed bad session data (as far as I can see).  After the error has been
generated in other words.

Cheers

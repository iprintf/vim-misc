fann_get_bit_fail_limit — Returns the bit fail limit used during training

说明

float fann_get_bit_fail_limit ( resource $ann )

Returns the bit fail limit used during training.

The bit fail limit is used during training where the stop function is set to
FANN_STOPFUNC_BIT.

The limit is the maximum accepted difference between the desired output and the
actual output during training. Each output that diverges more than this limit
is counted as an error bit. This difference is divided by two when dealing with
symmetric activation functions, so that symmetric and not symmetric activation
functions can use the same limit.

The default bit fail limit is 0.35.

参数

ann

    Neural network resource.

返回值

The bit fail limit, or FALSE on error.

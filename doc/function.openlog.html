(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

openlog — Open connection to system logger

说明

bool openlog ( string $ident , int $option , int $facility )

openlog() opens a connection to the system logger for a program.

The use of openlog() is optional. It will automatically be called by syslog()
if necessary, in which case ident will default to FALSE.

参数

ident

    The string ident is added to each message.

option

    The option argument is used to indicate what logging options will be used
    when generating a log message.

                               openlog() Options
     Constant                            Description
    LOG_CONS   if there is an error while sending data to the system logger,
               write directly to the system console
    LOG_NDELAY open the connection to the logger immediately
    LOG_ODELAY (default) delay opening the connection until the first message
               is logged
    LOG_PERROR print log message also to standard error
    LOG_PID    include PID with each message

    You can use one or more of this options. When using multiple options you
    need to OR them, i.e. to open the connection immediately, write to the
    console and include the PID in each message, you will use: LOG_CONS |
    LOG_NDELAY | LOG_PID

facility

    The facility argument is used to specify what type of program is logging
    the message. This allows you to specify (in your machine's syslog
    configuration) how messages coming from different facilities will be
    handled.

                             openlog() Facilities
       Constant                             Description
    LOG_AUTH        security/authorization messages (use LOG_AUTHPRIV instead
                    in systems where that constant is defined)
    LOG_AUTHPRIV    security/authorization messages (private)
    LOG_CRON        clock daemon (cron and at)
    LOG_DAEMON      other system daemons
    LOG_KERN        kernel messages
    LOG_LOCAL0 ...  reserved for local use, these are not available in Windows
    LOG_LOCAL7
    LOG_LPR         line printer subsystem
    LOG_MAIL        mail subsystem
    LOG_NEWS        USENET news subsystem
    LOG_SYSLOG      messages generated internally by syslogd
    LOG_USER        generic user-level messages
    LOG_UUCP        UUCP subsystem

        Note:

        LOG_USER is the only valid log type under Windows operating systems

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

===============================================================================

In second parameter int $option, PI means Process ID (PID).
That is the unique number given to that process. For eg [30326]
===============================================================================

To those curious; switching between different facilities is NOT an issue. There
is no apparent memory overhead (nor slowdown) by calling openlog multiple(12 *
10000) times.

Shown by this example:

<?php
$facilities = array(
    LOG_AUTH,
    LOG_AUTHPRIV,
    LOG_CRON,
    LOG_DAEMON,
    LOG_KERN,
    LOG_LOCAL0,
    LOG_LPR,
    LOG_MAIL,
    LOG_NEWS,
    LOG_SYSLOG,
    LOG_USER,
    LOG_UUCP,
);

for ($i = 0; $i < 10000; $i++) {
    foreach ($facilities as $facility) {
        openlog('test', LOG_PID, $facility);
        syslog(LOG_ERR, "This is a test: " . memory_get_usage(true));
    }
}
?>

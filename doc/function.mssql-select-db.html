mssql_select_db — Select MS SQL database

Warning

This function was REMOVED in PHP 7.0.0.

Alternatives to this function include:

  • PDO_ODBC DSN
  • sqlsrv_connect()
  • odbc_connect()

说明

bool mssql_select_db ( string $database_name [, resource $link_identifier ] )

mssql_select_db() sets the current active database on the server that's
associated with the specified link identifier.

Every subsequent call to mssql_query() will be made on the active database.

参数

database_name

    The database name.

    To escape the name of a database that contains spaces, hyphens ("-"), or
    any other exceptional characters, the database name must be enclosed in
    brackets, as is shown in the example, below. This technique must also be
    applied when selecting a database name that is also a reserved word (such
    as primary).

link_identifier

    A MS SQL link identifier, returned by mssql_connect() or mssql_pconnect().

    If no link identifier is specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no
    link is open, the function will try to establish a link as if mssql_connect
    () was called, and use it.

返回值

成功时返回 TRUE，或者在失败时返回 FALSE。

范例

Example #1 mssql_select_db() example

<?php
// Create a link to MSSQL
$link = mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');

// Select the database 'php'
mssql_select_db('php', $link);
?>

Example #2 Escaping the database name with square brackets

<?php
// Create a link to MSSQL
$link = mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');

// Select the database 'my.database-name'
mssql_select_db('[my.database-name]', $link);
?>

User Contributed Notes 2 notes

===============================================================================

I have noted that mssql_select_db fails if the database name contains a dash or
hyphen. for example a database named foo-bar will fail and the error that is
returned indicates that the name was interpreted as only 'foo'
===============================================================================

Use of square brackets to enclose the database name is also necessary if the
name contains a dot: '.'

e.g.

mssql_select_db('Company.ERP');

Produces the error:
Warning: mssql_select_db(): Sybase:  Server message:  Could not locate entry in
sysdatabases for database 'Company'. No entry found with that name. Make sure
that the name is entered correctly. (severity 16, procedure N/A) in

mssql_select_db('[Company.ERP]');

Will select successfully

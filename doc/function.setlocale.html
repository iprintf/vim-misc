setlocale

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

setlocale — 设置地区信息

说明

string setlocale ( int $category , string $locale [, string $... ] )
string setlocale ( int $category , array $locale )

设置地区信息。

参数

category

    category 命名常量指定的受区域设置的功能类别:
      □ LC_ALL 所有的设置
      □ LC_COLLATE 字符串比较, 详见 strcoll()
      □ LC_CTYPE 字符串的分类与转换, 参见例子 strtoupper()
      □ LC_MONETARY 等同 localeconv()
      □ LC_NUMERIC 对于小数点的分隔 (另请参见 localeconv())
      □ LC_TIME 时间与格式 strftime()
      □ LC_MESSAGES 系统响应 (如果PHP使用libintl编译)

locale

    If locale is NULL or the empty string "", the locale names will be set from
    the values of environment variables with the same names as the above
    categories, or from "LANG".

    If locale is "0", the locale setting is not affected, only the current
    setting is returned.

    If locale is an array or followed by additional parameters then each array
    element or parameter is tried to be set as new locale until success. This
    is useful if a locale is known under different names on different systems
    or for providing a fallback for a possibly not available locale.

...

    (可使用字符串或数组参数进行尝试直到设置成功。)

    Note:

    在Windows中，setlocale(LC_ALL, '')要从系统中的区域/语言设置(通过控制面板访
    问) 。

返回值

Returns the new current locale, or FALSE if the locale functionality is not
implemented on your platform, the specified locale does not exist or the
category name is invalid.

An invalid category name also causes a warning message. Category/locale names
can be found in » RFC 1766 and » ISO 639. Different systems have different
naming schemes for locales.

    Note:

    The return value of setlocale() depends on the system that PHP is running.
    It returns exactly what the system setlocale function returns.

更新日志

版本                                    说明
5.3.0 This function now throws an E_DEPRECATED notice if a string is passed to
      the category parameter instead of one of the LC_* constants.

范例

Example #1 setlocale() Examples

<?php
/* Set locale to Dutch */
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nl_NL');

/* Output: vrijdag 22 december 1978 */
echo strftime("%A %e %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));

/* try different possible locale names for german as of PHP 4.3.0 */
$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE@euro', 'de_DE', 'de', 'ge');
echo "Preferred locale for german on this system is '$loc_de'";
?>

Example #2 setlocale() Examples for Windows

<?php
/* Set locale to Dutch */
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nld_nld');

/* Output: vrijdag 22 december 1978 */
echo strftime("%A %d %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));

/* try different possible locale names for german as of PHP 4.3.0 */
$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE@euro', 'de_DE', 'deu_deu');
echo "Preferred locale for german on this system is '$loc_de'";
?>

注释

Warning

The locale information is maintained per process, not per thread. If you are
running PHP on a multithreaded server API like IIS or Apache on Windows, you
may experience sudden changes in locale settings while a script is running,
though the script itself never called setlocale(). This happens due to other
scripts running in different threads of the same process at the same time,
changing the process-wide locale using setlocale().

Tip

Windows users will find useful information about locale strings at Microsoft's 
MSDN website. Supported language strings can be found in the » language strings
documentation and supported country/region strings in the » country/region
strings documentation.

===============================================================================

be careful with the LC_ALL setting, as it may introduce some unwanted
conversions. For example, I used

setlocale (LC_ALL, "Dutch");

to get my weekdays in dutch on the page. From that moment on (as I found out
many hours later) my floating point values from MYSQL where interpreted as
integers because the Dutch locale wants a comma (,) instead of a point (.)
before the decimals. I tried printf, number_format, floatval.... all to no
avail. 1.50 was always printed as 1.00 :(

When I set my locale to :

setlocale (LC_TIME, "Dutch");

my weekdays are good now and my floating point values too.

I hope I can save some people the trouble of figuring this out by themselves.

//Fix encoding for russian locale on windows
$locale = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'ru_RU.CP1251', 'rus_RUS.CP1251',
'Russian_Russia.1251');

function strftime_fix($format, $locale, $timestamp = time()){
    // Fix %e for windows
    if (strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0, 3)) == 'WIN') {
        $format = preg_replace('#(?<!%)((?:%%)*)%e#', '\1%#d', $format);
    }
    // convert
    $date_str = strftime($format, $timestamp);
    if (stripos($locale, "1251") !== false) {
      return iconv("windows-1251","utf-8", $date_str);
    } elseif (stripos($locale, "1252") !== false) {
      return iconv("windows-1252","utf-8", $date_str);
    } else {
      return $date_str;
    }
}
===============================================================================

If you are looking for a getlocale() function simply pass 0 (zero) as the
second parameter to setlocale().

Beware though if you use the category LC_ALL and some of the locales differ as
a string containing all the locales is returned:

<?php
echo setlocale(LC_ALL, 0);

// LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=C;LC_COLLATE=C;LC_MONETARY=C;
LC_MESSAGES=C;LC_PAPER=C;LC_NAME=C;
// LC_ADDRESS=C;LC_TELEPHONE=C;LC_MEASUREMENT=C;LC_IDENTIFICATION=C

echo setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 0);

// en_US.UTF-8

setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8");
echo setlocale(LC_ALL, 0);

// en_US.UTF-8

?>

If you are looking to store and reset the locales you could do something like
this:

<?php

$originalLocales = explode(";", setlocale(LC_ALL, 0));
setlocale(LC_ALL, "nb_NO.utf8");

// Do something

foreach ($originalLocales as $localeSetting) {
  if (strpos($localeSetting, "=") !== false) {
    list ($category, $locale) = explode("=", $localeSetting);
  }
  else {
    $category = LC_ALL;
    $locale   = $localeSetting;
  }
  setlocale($category, $locale);
}

?>

The above works here (Ubuntu Linux) but as the setlocale() function is just
wrapping the equivalent system calls, your mileage may vary on the result.
===============================================================================

It took me a while to figure out how to get a Finnish locale correctly set on
Ubuntu Server with Apache2 and PHP5.

At first the output for "locale -a" was this:
C
en_US.utf8
POSIX

I had to install a finnish language pack with
"sudo apt-get install language-pack-fi-base"

Now the output for "locale -a" is:
C
en_US.utf8
fi_FI.utf8
POSIX

The last thing you need to do after installing the correct language pack is
restart Apache with "sudo apache2ctl restart". The locale "fi_FI.utf8" can then
be used in PHP5 after restarting Apache.

For setting Finnish timezone and locale in PHP use:
<?php
date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Helsinki');
setlocale(LC_ALL, array('fi_FI.UTF-8','fi_FI@euro','fi_FI','finnish'));
?>
===============================================================================

!!WARNING!!

The "locale" always depend on the server configuration.

i.e.:
When trying to use "pt_BR" on some servers you will ALWAYS get false. Even with
other languages.

The locale string need to be supported by the server. Sometimes there are
diferents charsets for a language, like "pt_BR.utf-8" and "pt_BR.iso-8859-1",
but there is no support for a _standard_ "pt_BR".

This problem occours in Windows platform too. Here you need to call
"portuguese" or "spanish" or "german" or...

Maybe the only way to try to get success calling the function setlocale() is:
setlocale(LC_ALL, "pt_BR", "pt_BR.iso-8859-1", "pt_BR.utf-8", "portuguese",
...);

But NEVER trust on that when making functions like date conversions or number
formating. The best way to make sure you are doing the right thing, is using
the default "en_US" or "en_UK", by not calling the setlocale() function. Or,
make sure that your server support the lang you want to use, with some tests.

Remember that: Using the default locale setings is the best way to "talk" with
other applications, like dbs or rpc servers, too.

Pay attention to the syntax.
- UTF8 without dash ('-')
- locale.codeset and not locale-codeset.

Stupid newbie error but worth knowing them when starting with gettext.

<?php
$codeset = "UTF8";  // warning ! not UTF-8 with dash '-'
       
// for windows compatibility (e.g. xampp) : theses 3 lines are useless for
linux systems

putenv('LANG='.$lang.'.'.$codeset);
putenv('LANGUAGE='.$lang.'.'.$codeset);
bind_textdomain_codeset('mydomain', $codeset);

// set locale
bindtextdomain('mydomain', ABSPATH.'/locale/');
setlocale(LC_ALL, $lang.'.'.$codeset);
textdomain('mydomain');
?>

where directory structure of locale is (for example) :
locale/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/mydomain.mo
locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/mydomain.mo

and ABSPATH is the absolute path to the locale dir

further note, under linux systems, it seems to be necessary to create the
locale at os level using 'locale-gen'.
===============================================================================

Instead, using php with IIS, I had to use this line for Italian language...

<?php setlocale(LC_ALL, 'Italian_Italy.1250'); ?>
===============================================================================

The example from bruno dot cenou at revues dot org below shows the possibility,
but I want to spell it out: you can add charset info to setlocale.

Example:

Into my utf-8-encoded page I want to insert the name of the current month,
which happens to be March, in German "März" - with umlaut. If you use

   setlocale(LC_TIME, 'de_DE');
   echo strftime("%B");

this will return "M&auml;rz", but that html-entity will look like this on a
utf-8 page: "M?rz". Not what I want.

But if you use

   setlocale(LC_TIME, 'de_DE.UTF8');  // note the charset info !
   echo strftime("%B");

this returns "M√§rz", which, on utf-8, looks like it should: "März".
===============================================================================

For Windows users complaining about setlocale.

The locale argument to the setlocale function takes the following form:
setlocale( LC_ALL, "<language>_<country>.<code_page>" );

in short, if you  want use for example: es_CO.UTF-8 it must be in Windows:
Spanish_Colombia.1252

The code page 1252 is ISO-8859-1 (windows-1252    ANSI Latin 1; Western
European (Windows)

Windows use different languages code from Unix, for example, es_CO becomes
es-CO or Spanish_Colombia, also it doesn't support UTF-8 charset as is shown in
their website: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x99tb11d(v=vs.140).aspx

"The set of available locale names, languages, country/region codes, and code
pages includes all those supported by the Windows NLS API except code pages
that require more than two bytes per character, such as UTF-7 and UTF-8. If you
provide a code page value of UTF-7 or UTF-8, setlocale will fail, returning
NULL."

Setting locale that is not supported by your system will result in some string
operations returning a question mark "?" in your strings where it needs to
perform transliteration.

1) Always check the return of setlocale() to ensure it has set to something
supported

2) on Linux you can use the "locale -a" command to find a list of supported
locales
===============================================================================

When i tried to get the current locale (e.g. after i set the lang to german
with setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE'); ), the following did not work on my suse linux
9.0-box:
$currentLocale = setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL);
This code did a reset to the server-setting.

$currentLocale = setlocale(LC_ALL, 0); works perfectly for me, but the manual
says NULL and 0 are equal in this case, but NULL seems to act like "".
===============================================================================

For debian/ubuntu, don't forget the charset UFT8.

// Works on Ubuntu 8.04 Server
setlocale(LC_TIME, 'fr_FR.UTF8', 'fr.UTF8', 'fr_FR.UTF-8', 'fr.UTF-8');
===============================================================================

In *some* Windows systems, setting LC_TIME only will not work, you must either
set LC_ALL or both LC_CTYPE and LC_TIME. BUT if you have already set LC_TIME
using setlocale earlier in the script, dates will not be affected! For example:
<?php
setlocale(LC_TIME, 'greek');
setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'greek');
?>
will not work, while
<?php
setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'greek');
setlocale(LC_TIME, 'greek');
?>
will do the job.
===============================================================================

Posting this in the hope it might be useful to others, as I could find very
little info anywhere. If you want to use a Welsh locale and have the suitable
language support installed, you pass 'cym' (abbreviated form of Cymraeg) to
setlocale:

<?php
setlocale(LC_TIME, 'cym');
$welsh= gmstrftime("%A, %B %Y - %H:%M",time());
echo $welsh;
?>

The above certainly applies to Windows systems, but should also apply to Unix
if the required support is installed.

Cheers,

Bryn.
===============================================================================

On Linux, setlocale() depends on the installed locales. To see which locales
are available to PHP, run this from the terminal:

"locale -a"

Provided list are all locales that are available on your server for PHP to use.
To add a new one, run

locale-gen <locale name> (this may need sudo / root permissions), for example
to add a Czech locale, run something like this:

"sudo locale-gen cs_CZ.utf8"

Then you can use this locale declaration:

setlocale(LC_ALL, 'cs_CZ.utf8');
===============================================================================

My script runs a loop that changes the locale (multilingual application). I've
noticed that on some random occasion the locale still hasn't changed despite
the setlocale() function being executed a step earlier. I had to add wait time
for this condition. Interestingly enough, this was the case only with the
'nl_NL.UTF8' locale.

<?php
//some code
$this->counter = 0;
// some code
$this->locale = 'nl_NL.UTF8';
setlocale(LC_ALL, $this->locale);
    $this->counter++;
    if ($this->locale !== setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 0)) { // Locale not changed yet.
      if ($this->counter > 10) {
        return;
      }
      sleep(1);
    }
// some code
?>
===============================================================================

In Windows some times setlocale don't work, it return a empty array, buts the
locale is set. I found that apache start before windows "load" locales, you
must restart apache to solve this.
===============================================================================

To find the locale of a Unix system:
<?php system('locale -a') ?>
===============================================================================

For Portugal I had to use

<?php setlocale(LC_ALL, 'Portuguese_Portugal.1252'); ?>

using php with IIS on Windows server.
===============================================================================

In addition to russ, about getting / backing up the locale:
I'm using this in unit-tests. I wanted to test something based on locale, and
reset the locale after the tests were done.

Yet there were some errors;
* setlocale doesn't like strings anymore. You need to use constants.
* Some contants don't exist anymore.

Here's an updated piece of code:

<?php
$originalLocales = explode(";", setlocale(LC_ALL, 0));
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nl_NL.UTF-8');

//Do something here

//Recover to the default setting
        $skipConstants = array( //these will be returned by setlocale(LC_ALL,
0), but don't exist anymore.
            'LC_PAPER',
            'LC_NAME',
            'LC_ADDRESS',
            'LC_TELEPHONE',
            'LC_MEASUREMENT',
            'LC_IDENTIFICATION'
        );

        foreach ($originalLocales as $localeSetting) {
            if (strpos($localeSetting, "=") !== false) {
                list ($category, $locale) = explode("=", $localeSetting);
            } else {
                $category = LC_ALL;
                $locale   = $localeSetting;
            }

            if (!in_array($category, $skipConstants)) {
                setlocale(constant($category), $locale); //Using strings is
deprecated.
            }
        }
?>
===============================================================================

Regarding dash'es in locale, it appears they should be omitted entirely.

In /etc/locale.gen I have

da_DK.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15

but locale -a gives

da_DK.iso885915

which is the format setlocale()  wants.

(Debian)
===============================================================================

For a php Mysql query, you could also use, for french canadian, in this example
:

$query = 'SET lc_time_names = "fr_CA"';
$result = mysql_query($query) or die("Query failed");

$query = 'SELECT @@lc_time_names';
$result = mysql_query($query) or die("Query failed");

$query = 'SELECT id, created, YEAR(created) as year, MONTH(created) as month,'
.
' CONCAT_WS(" ", MONTHNAME(created), YEAR(created)) as archive' .           
' FROM #__TABLE as e' .
' GROUP BY archive' .
' ORDER BY id DESC';

Your data will be displayed in any locale setting you want. You may even $_GET
[lc_time_name] from your multilanguage website.
===============================================================================

It is correct as stated below that it is common that the UTF-8 should be used
without the dash. However on some systems (e.g. MacOS 10.4) the dash is
essential.
===============================================================================

I experienced the behavior stated in the above Warning box: Running PHP5 on a
multithreaded Apache made the current locale change sometimes all of a sudden
within a script, so strftime() output wasn't in the required format.

I recompiled Apache with the prefork MPM and now it works like a charm. Took me
a long time to find out the reason as I overlooked the warning box searching
for either a bug report or a programming error of mine...
===============================================================================

There is a new PECL extension under development called intl (it will be
available in PHP5.3). Meanwhile all who rely on the setlocale() and friends
should be aware about the limitations of them as covered in this post on the
onPHP5.com blog: http://www.onphp5.com/article/22
===============================================================================

To complement Sven K's tip about debian:

You can also install the package locales-all
That one holds all the locales there are in compiled form.
===============================================================================

For those of you who are unfortunate enough (like me) to work in Windows
environment, and try to set the locale to a language _and_ to UTF-8 charset,
and were unable to do it, here is a workaround.

For example to output the date in hungarian with UTF-8 charset, this will work:

    $dateString = "%B %d., %A";
    setlocale(LC_ALL,'hungarian');
    $res=strftime($dateString);
    echo(iconv('ISO-8859-1', 'UTF-8', $res));

If anybody knows how to set the locale on Windows to the equivalent of
"hu_HU.UTF-8" on unix, please do tell me.
===============================================================================

If your system doesn't show any installed locales by "locale -a", try
installing them by "dpkg-reconfigure locales" (on debian).
===============================================================================

On windows:
Control Panel->International Settings
You can set your locale and customize it
And locale-related PHP functions work perfectly
===============================================================================

On Linux/Apache, when you install and try to use a new locale, the setlocale()
function with the new locale will fail sometimes, but not always. To
furthermore complicate, setlocale() will always complete with any of the
previously installed locales. This would seem a really weird behaviour, which
you can fix by restarting Apache, as Kari Sderholm aka Haprog mentioned, but I
felt it needed to be properly pointed out.
===============================================================================

Note about using UTF-8 locale charset on Windows systems:

According to MSDN, Windows setlocale()'s implementation does not support UTF-8
encoding.

Citation from "MSDN setlocale, _wsetlocale" page (http://msdn.microsoft.com/
en-us/library/x99tb11d.aspx):
The set of available languages, country/region codes, and code pages includes
all those supported by the Win32 NLS API except code pages that require more
than two bytes per character, such as UTF-7 and UTF-8. If you provide a code
page like UTF-7 or UTF-8, setlocale will fail, returning NULL.

So basically, code like
<?php setlocale(LC_ALL, 'Czech_Czech Republic.65001'); // 65001 is UTF-8
codepage ?>
does not work on Windows at all.

(written in time of PHP 5.2.4)
===============================================================================

Debian users: Addition to Gabor Deri's note: if setlocale doesn't work in your
locale and you're on Debian, and Gabor Deri's note doesn't work, you have to
install the locales package.

As root, type: "apt-get install locales" and it will be installed.
===============================================================================

In most Unix/Linux system, you could use:

locale -a

This will list all available locales on the server.
===============================================================================

Be carefull - setting a locale which uses commas instead of dots in numbers may
cause a mysql db not to understand the query:
<?php
setlocale(LC_ALL,"pl");
$price = 1234 / 100; // now the price looks like 12,34
$query = mysql_query("SELECT Id FROM table WHERE price='".$price."'");
?>
Even if there is a price 12.34 - nothing will be found
===============================================================================

<?php

// the last foldername only contains a german umlaut (lower a with two dots = \
xE4 in ISO-8859-1)
$path = "/home/madmax/photos_from_the_last_10_years/\xE4"

// php escapeshellarg remove characters (depends on locale settings)
// the following example will delete /home/madmax/photos_from_the_last_10_years

// instead of /home/madmax/photos_from_the_last_10_years/ä

shell_exec(sprintf('rm -fr %s' escapeshellarg($path)));

// dear php developers, how stupid is that?
// I tell you: it is very very stupid! The problem exists since years and

===============================================================================

On Novell Netware, the language codes require hyphens, not underscores, and
using anything other than LC_ALL doesn't work directly.

So... (from their support list)....

You have to set TIME, NUMERIC etc. info in two steps as given below rather than
one. This is due to the limitation of setlocale function of LibC.
<?php
   setlocale(LC_ALL, 'es-ES');
   $loc = setlocale(LC_TIME, NULL);
   echo strftime("%A %e %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));
  // jeuves 22 diciembre 1978
?>
This should work.

or of course, reset LC_ALL...
<?php
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'es-ES');
echo strftime("%A %e %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));
setlocale(LC_ALL, '');
// jeuves 22 diciembre 1978
?>
===============================================================================

On Ubuntu, you have to take p.e. "de_DE.utf8", all available languages you can
get with:
    locale -a
===============================================================================

if your server is an ubuntu (debian like)
you need to install the locales you want (default is english and your language)
go to aptitude and install -language-pack-*-base it will resolve dependencies
and will try to install a suggested package, remove it if you don't care and
proceed.
===============================================================================

check /usr/share/locale/ if you want more info about the locale available with
your *NIX box

there is also a file called /usr/share/locale/locale.alias with a list of
aliases
such as swedish for sv_SE

so on all boxes i have accounts on (rh 6.0 and slack 3.4) you can just use
setlocale("LC_ALL","swedish"); or other prefered language in plain english.

However, the weekdays were in all lowercase :(

Note: export LC_ALL=swedish made a lot of programs swedish for me, it's also
possible to make them russian or japanese :)
===============================================================================

Under FreeBSD, locale definitions are stored in the /usr/share/locale/
directory. Danish time formats and weekdays, for instance, are stored in /usr/
share/locale/da_DK.ISO_8859-1/LC_TIME.

Please take heed and read the warning above if you are running on a XAMPP or
any other Windows apache server! It just took me far too long to figure this
out; and all the while there was a warning right on the page.

If you're experiencing shifting locale settings (check with setlocale
(LC_ALL,0), returning the current locale stuff) and you're running a windows
server, then it's not just you! Again, I urge everyone to read the red, but oh
so easy not to read, warning message on this page.

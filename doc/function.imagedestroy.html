===============================================================================

When the script stop PHP will automatic destory ANY
resources, this goes for aswell for images, thus in the
case the use clicks the stop button, php will automatic
clear the resource.

thus imagedestroy is used to clear the memory BEFORE
the script ends. this is usefull to keep memory usage
DURING the script to an acceptable level.

hope this clear somethings up.
===============================================================================

When working with a lot of high-resolution images, it's IMPERATIVE that you use
the imagedestroy() function.

In my scenario, I was taking two high resolution desktop wallpapers and
shrinking them down into successively smaller ones (preventing the user from
having to upload a dozen files).

At first, my script would run, then just stop.  I realized later that I had not
destroyed the source image and the newly resized image in memory after I had
finished writing the file out to disk.  Thus, I quickly reached the memory
limit that my hosting provider placed in their php.ini file.

Reusing an image variable does NOT clear the old data out of memory!  You must
use imagedestroy() to clear the data out.  (I don't know if unset() works as
well).

Also note that the image data in memory is raw, so don't base how much memory
you are using based on the original filesize of the compressed image (such as
jpeg or png).
===============================================================================

And to continue what Docey said, if php did not destroy all resources when the
script stopped it would be a huge memory leak and everyone would be crying out
for it to be fixed right away.

I have been using this function during a script that was breaking an image made
of many little icons into the little parts, which could mean 400+ images in the
one script, which was using a lot of memory so I needed to destroy them.
===============================================================================

I have noticed that gd drawing functions can behave oddly if there is a
previous image which has not been imagedestroy()'ed.  You should always
imagedestroy when you are done with an image object.
===============================================================================

In theory creating an image object and calling imagedestroy in your destructor
should be a good way of doing it; something like:

<?php
final class My_Image() {

  private $img;

  public function __construct() {
    $this->img = imagecreatetruecolor();
    // ... other stuff ...
  }

  public function __destruct() {
    if(is_resource($this->img)) {
      imagedestroy($this->img);
    }
  }

  // ... other methods...

}
?>

I check that $this->img is a resource in case imagecreatetruecolor() fails or
you null the value somewhere down the line from a method call meaning that
$this->img is NOT a resource, in which case imagedestroy is an unecessary
function call that just fails with a warning message.
===============================================================================

Caution should be observed with imagedestroy(); copying your reference variable
over to another variable will cause imagedestroy to destroy both at once.

Eg.:

$a = imagecreate(...);
$b = $a;
imagedestroy($a);

While you'd think $b still contains your image, it doesn't. Both $a and $b are
destroyed.

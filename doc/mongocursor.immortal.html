MongoCursor::immortal — Sets whether this cursor will timeout

说明

public MongoCursor MongoCursor::immortal ([ bool $liveForever = true ] )

After remaining idle on the server for some amount of time, cursors, by
default, "die." This is generally the behavior one wants. The database cleans
up a cursor once all of its results have been sent to the client, but if the
client doesn't request all of the results, the cursor will languish there,
taking up resources. Thus, after a few minutes, the cursor "times out" and the
database assumes the client has gotten everything it needs and cleans up its
the cursor's resources.

If, for some reason, you need a cursor to hang around for a long time, you can
prevent the database from cleaning it up by using this method. However, if you
make a cursor immortal, you need to iterate through all of its results (or at
least until MongoCursor::dead() returns TRUE) or the cursor will hang around
the database forever, taking up resources.

参数

liveForever

    If the cursor should be immortal.

返回值

===============================================================================

Calling immortal(false), in order to remove the NO_TIMEOUT flag from the
cursor, seems to crash with "Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack
frame in Unknown on line 0". I'm running PHP 5.2.17 and MongoDB driver 1.1.4.

Note:: There there is an important distinction between timeout and immortal!
Timeout indicates the time to wait on the _client_ side while immortal sets the
cursor on the server side.

It is especially useful for large result sets in sharded environments.

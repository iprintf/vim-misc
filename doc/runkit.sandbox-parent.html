Runkit_Sandbox_Parent — Runkit Anti-Sandbox Class

说明

void Runkit_Sandbox_Parent::__construct ( void )

Instantiating the Runkit_Sandbox_Parent class from within a sandbox environment
created from the Runkit_Sandbox class provides some (controlled) means for a
sandbox child to access its parent.

    Note: 沙箱支持（是 runkit_lint()，runkit_lint_file() 函数，与
    Runkit_Sandbox 类所必需）仅可用于 PHP 5.1.0 或 PHP 5.0 的特别修补版本，并需
    启用线程安全。更多信息可参见 runkit 包中的 README 文件。

In order for any of the Runkit_Sandbox_Parent features to function. Support
must be enabled on a per-sandbox basis by enabling the parent_access flag from
the parent's context.

Example #1 Working with variables in a sandbox

<?php
$sandbox = new Runkit_Sandbox();
$sandbox['parent_access'] = true;
?>

Accessing the Parent's Variables

Just as with sandbox variable access, a sandbox parent's variables may be read
from and written to as properties of the Runkit_Sandbox_Parent class. Read
access to parental variables may be enabled with the parent_read setting (in
addition to the base parent_access setting). Write access, in turn, is enabled
through the parent_write setting.

Unlike sandbox child variable access, the variable scope is not limited to
globals only. By setting the parent_scope setting to an appropriate integer
value, other scopes in the active call stack may be inspected instead. A value
of 0 (Default) will direct variable access at the global scope. 1 will point
variable access at whatever variable scope was active at the time the current
block of sandbox code was executed. Higher values progress back through the
functions that called the functions that led to the sandbox executing code that
tried to access its own parent's variables.

Example #2 Accessing parental variables

<?php
$php = new Runkit_Sandbox();
$php['parent_access'] = true;
$php['parent_read'] = true;

$test = "Global";

$php->eval('$PARENT = new Runkit_Sandbox_Parent;');

$php['parent_scope'] = 0;
one();

$php['parent_scope'] = 1;
one();

$php['parent_scope'] = 2;
one();

$php['parent_scope'] = 3;
one();

$php['parent_scope'] = 4;
one();

$php['parent_scope'] = 5;
one();

function one() {
    $test = "one()";
    two();
}

function two() {
    $test = "two()";
    three();
}

function three() {
    $test = "three()";
    $GLOBALS['php']->eval('var_dump($PARENT->test);');
}
?>

以上例程会输出：

string(6) "Global"
string(7) "three()"
string(5) "two()"
string(5) "one()"
string(6) "Global"
string(6) "Global"

Calling the Parent's Functions

Just as with sandbox access, a sandbox may access its parents functions
providing that the proper settings have been enabled. Enabling parent_call will
allow the sandbox to call all functions available to the parent scope. Language
constructs are each controlled by their own setting: print and echo are enabled
with parent_echo. die() and exit() are enabled with parent_die. eval() is
enabled with parent_eval while include, include_once, require, and require_once
are enabled through parent_include.

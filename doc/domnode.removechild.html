DOMNode::removeChild

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

DOMNode::removeChild — Removes child from list of children

说明

public DOMNode DOMNode::removeChild ( DOMNode $oldnode )

This functions removes a child from a list of children.

参数

oldnode

    The removed child.

返回值

If the child could be removed the function returns the old child.

错误／异常

DOM_NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

    Raised if this node is readonly.

DOM_NOT_FOUND

    Raised if oldnode is not a child of this node.

范例

The following example will delete the chapter element of our XML document.

Example #1 Removing a child

<?php

$doc = new DOMDocument;
$doc->load('book.xml');

$book = $doc->documentElement;

// we retrieve the chapter and remove it from the book
$chapter = $book->getElementsByTagName('chapter')->item(0);
$oldchapter = $book->removeChild($chapter);

echo $doc->saveXML();
?>

以上例程会输出：

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
          "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd">
<book id="listing">
 <title>My lists</title>

</book>

You can't remove DOMNodes from a DOMNodeList as you're iterating over them in a
foreach loop. For example...

<?php
$domNodeList = $domDocument->getElementsByTagname('p');
foreach ( $domNodeList as $domElement ) {
  //  ...do stuff with $domElement...
  $domElement->parentNode->removeChild($domElement);
}
?>

... will seemingly leave the internal iterator on the foreach out of wack and
results will be quite strange. Though, making a queue of items to remove seems
to work. For example...

<?php
$domNodeList = $domDocument->getElementsByTagname('p');
$domElemsToRemove = array();
foreach ( $domNodeList as $domElement ) {
  // ...do stuff with $domElement...
  $domElemsToRemove[] = $domElement;
}
foreach( $domElemsToRemove as $domElement ){
  $domElement->parentNode->removeChild($domElement);
}
?>
===============================================================================

Just a note, if you remove a node the whitespace it occupied will remain if you
save the file.

To avoid this, use $document->preserveWhiteSpace = false;

For Example:

<?php
$document = new DomDocument();
$document->preserveWhiteSpace = false;
?>

These two functions might be helpful to anyone trying to delete a node and all
of its children:

<?php
function deleteNode($node) {
    deleteChildren($node);
    $parent = $node->parentNode;
    $oldnode = $parent->removeChild($node);
}

function deleteChildren($node) {
    while (isset($node->firstChild)) {
        deleteChildren($node->firstChild);
        $node->removeChild($node->firstChild);
    }
}
?>
===============================================================================

This method will remove all child nodes but leave the attributes (and namespace
declarations) intact.

<?php
function removeChildren( &$node )
{
  $node->parentNode->replaceChild(
    $n = $node->cloneNode( false ),
    $node );

  $node = $n;
}
?>

I used the following to delete an entire node using the child element:

<?php
$childElement->parentNode->parentNode-> removeChild($childElement->parentNode);
?>

I could not have thought of it without the help of everyone who contributed to
this thread.

Thanks!

(I had to introduce the extra space between parentNode->removeChild to get rid
of the wordwrap() warning while posting this note)
===============================================================================

If you try to remove children of a nested node (e.g. a <ul> list that contains
another <ul>) and only remove the first level of child nodes, you'll get a
messed-up node object.

Upon re-use of the messed-up node you'll get an error message that says: "Fatal
error: Call to a member function blahblah() on a non-object".

To remove ALL child nodes, use this recursive function instead:
<?php
/**
* Helper function that removes all child nodes of $node recursively
* (i.e. including child nodes of the child nodes and so forth).
*/
function remove_children(&$node) {
  while ($node->firstChild) {
    while ($node->firstChild->firstChild) {
      remove_children($node->firstChild);
    }
    $node->removeChild($node->firstChild);
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

Or something like:

<?php

while ($node->childNodes->length)
     $node->removeChild($node->firstChild);

?>
===============================================================================

Note that iterating through the childNodes array and removing those children
will stop the iteration.

For example:
<?php
foreach($node->childNodes as $child)
{
  if(iWantToDeleteThisNode($child))
     $child->parentNode->removeChild($child);
}
?>

Will not work.  Note that in removing the node, the childNodes array gets
rebuilt (it seems) and so only the first item will be removed.  In order to
properly remove all the children you want to remove, you will need to do
something like the following:

<?php
$nodesToDelete = array();
foreach($node->childNodes as $child)
{
  if(iWantToDeleteThisNode($child))
    $nodesToDelete[] = $child;
}
foreach($nodesToDelete as $node)
{
  $node->parentNode->removeChild($node);
}
?>

I believe this is actually more efficient than the first snippet would be (if
it worked) but obviously I cannot benchmark it.
===============================================================================

You may also use the hasChild function:
<?php

while($node->hasChildNodes()) {
  $node->removeChild($node->childNodes->item(0));
}

?>

When you remove a childNode, the next node becomes the first one!
===============================================================================

For those who don't understand >sbeam at onsetcorps dot net on 02-Feb-2005
12:07< 'hack', here's a little discussion:

First but *wrong* try would be:
<?php
foreach ($parent->childNodes as $child) {
   $parent->removeChild($child);
?>
This doesn't work because DOM tree id modified on-the-fly and this confuses
foreach loop.

The idea behind sbeam's trick is that after removing the first item in the
first iteration, the second item in childNodes nodelist immediately becomes the
first item. That's why we must _always_ remove the first child. Here's another
implementation:

<?php
$count = $parent->childNodes->length;
for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
   $oldNode = $parent->removeChild($parent->childNodes->item(0)); // !!! not
item($i) !!!
}
?>
===============================================================================

Back again on removing childs and iterators robustness.

Things get a bit more complicated when you only want to remove 'some' nodes
according to a certain condition. Then you can't just remove the first one
repeatedly.

The trick is to copy the content of the node list into a more robust collection
than DOMNodeList, I name array!

The following piece of code will, for instance, remove all empty child nodes:

<?php
// Copy childNodes array
$childNodes = array();
foreach($node->childNodes as $childNode) {
  $childNodes[] = $childNode;
}

// Browse with the copy    
foreach ($childNodes as $childNode) {
  if (!$childNode->hasChildNodes()); {
    $childNode->parentNode->removeChild($childNode);
  }
}
?>
===============================================================================

This might be obvious, but might help someone as well...

If you simply have a node that you need to remove (perhaps from an xpath) and
don't know the parent node offhand (the examples seem to assume you have the
parent in a variable), then you can do something easy like this...

$node->parentNode->removeChild($node);

parentNode is a scalar property of the Element.

Hope that helps.

At the time of writing, I suppose rightfully, removeChild() removes only the
selected node, but when you remove an element, it's child elements are not
removed. If you want to achieve that, replaceChild() is the solution.

The following should remove all descendants of the $node DOMNode, regardless of
it's name:
<?php
$node->replaceChild(new DOMElement($node->nodeName), $node);
?>
If you're replacing the root element, you must explicitly state that with
$node->documentElement as the second argument.

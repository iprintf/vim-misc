EventHttpRequest::sendReplyStart — Initiate a chunked reply

说明

public void EventHttpRequest::sendReplyStart ( int $code , string $reason )

Initiate a reply that uses Transfer-Encoding chunked .

This allows the caller to stream the reply back to the client and is useful
when either not all of the reply data is immediately available or when sending
very large replies.

The caller needs to supply data chunks with EventHttpRequest::sendReplyChunk()
and complete the reply by calling EventHttpRequest::sendReplyEnd() .

参数

code

    The HTTP response code to send.

reason

    A brief message to send with the response code.

返回值

没有返回值。

    request as appropriate
